4,<mark> 1 priority of public safety is guaranteed and that the No</mark>
5,"<mark> 2 priority, the desired effect of getting some gas out, assuming public safety is guaranteed, is also taken care of</mark>"
6,"<mark> Friends announcement that there will be a deployment of British Challenger 2 tanks to Poland to allow our Polish allies to send the Sovietera tanks to Ukraine, but, to my knowledge, there has not been an agreement within NATO to facilitate Polish MiG fighter jets being sent to Ukraine</mark>"
7,"<mark> I submitted a written question asking for the detail of all the routes available, and the detail of those routes fits on half a page, because there are practically none for the entire world</mark>"
8,"<mark> 83H2, That a Committee be appointed to draw up Reasons to be assigned to the Lords for disagreeing to their amendment 29B and for insisting on disagreement to Lords amendment 80, for insisting on amendments 80A to 80N in lieu and for disagreeing to Lords amendments 80P and 80Q;</mark>"
9,"<mark>During the pandemic period, over 5 million people delayed applying for a British passport</mark>"
10,"<mark> This has helped to deliver record output, with over 1 million applications processed last month alone</mark>"
11,"<mark>I would just point out that between January and March, over 90% of cases were completed within six weeks, but we advise people to allow up to 10 weeks for their application</mark>"
12,<mark>The problem we have is that this debate has to finish at 7</mark>
13,"<mark> Friend is a doughty campaigner for spending 3% and I consider him my longrange artillery when it comes to the lobbying in the long term, whatever we see as a result of the situation in Ukraine</mark>"
14,"<mark> Yes, to date we have gifted in aid £200 million to Ukraine, which we propose will grow to £500 million, and the Treasury has agreed to old for new in funding that replacement</mark>"
15,"<mark>We have given, I think, more than £100 million in aid, but I will write to the hon</mark>"
16,"<mark>Ukraine is facing a financial crisis, with the Financial Times reporting that revenues are at around half of prewar levels, and the fiscal gap for this month alone is projected to be $7 billion</mark>"
17,"<mark> He has been granted £427,000 for a range of practical initiatives designed to keep women safe on the streets at night, including drink spiking kits, taxi marshals, street pastors and more</mark>"
18,"<mark> A number of sources suggest that, to date, over 2,000 armoured vehicles have been destroyed or captured</mark>"
19,"<mark> At the start of this conflict, Russia had committed more than 120 battalion tactical groups, approximately 65% of its entire ground combat strength</mark>"
20,"<mark> According to our current assessment, about 25% of those have been rendered not combateffective</mark>"
21,"<mark> To date we have provided more than 5,000 antitank missiles, five air defence systems with more than 100 missiles, 1,360 antistructure munitions, and 4</mark>"
22,<mark>5 tonnes of plastic explosive</mark>
23,"<mark> That was quickly   followed by the Prime Ministers announcement of a further £100 millionworth of highgrade military equipment, 120 armoured vehicles, sourcing antiship missile systems, and hightech loitering munitions for precision strikes</mark>"
24,<mark> So far these efforts have yielded some 2</mark>
25,"<mark>5 million items of equipment, worth more than £1</mark>"
26,<mark>5 billion</mark>
27,"<mark> To date, we have sent more than 90,000 ration packs, more than 10 pallets of medical equipment, more than 3,000 pieces of body armour, nearly 77,000 helmets, 3,000 pairs of boots and much more, including communications equipment and ear defence</mark>"
28,"<mark> We have deployed hundreds of Royal Marines to Poland, and sent offshore vessels and Navy destroyers to the eastern Mediterranean</mark>"
29,"<mark> As the Prime Minister announced on Friday, we are also offering a deployment of British Challenger 2 tanks  to Poland, to bridge the gap between Poland donating tanks to Ukraine and their replacements arriving from a third country</mark>"
30,"<mark> I am sorry if he has cut short his trip, and I would be delighted to arrange with the Navy for him to return to the headquarters, without his phone, for longer in custody</mark>"
31,"<mark> I can update further that to date we have also supplied 5,361 NLAWsup from the original 2,000; more than 200 Javelins; and 104 highvelocity and lowvelocity antiair missilesthis will grow to more than 250</mark>"
32,"<mark> Gentleman made a point about how we are now the only country, but that is because we were the first country; when we had our £24 billion settlement, no one else in NATO had yet gone there</mark>"
33,<mark> They are still a shortrange missilethe block 1s have a range of about 7 kmand they are not strategic</mark>
34,"<mark> He says the UK has provided 5,000 antitank missiles and 100 antiair missiles, but these direct donations are a fraction of the total</mark>"
35,<mark> Is it not now time to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP</mark>
36,"<mark> She will also reflect on the fact that when the statistics for crime in England and Wales for year ending September 2021 were published, neighbourhood crime was 33% lower than the previous year, burglary offences were lower than the previous year, and other offences including robbery, vehicle offences and theft from the person were also down</mark>"
37,"<mark> She will also reflect on the fact that when the statistics for crime in England and Wales for year ending September 2021 were published, neighbourhood crime was 33% lower than the previous year, burglary offences were lower than the previous year, and other offences including robbery, vehicle offences and theft from the person were also down</mark>"
38,"<mark> Does she agree that, along with our £450 million package of military aid for Ukraine, the unprecedented package of sanctions against Russia, and worldleading aid provision, that demonstrates our unwavering commitment to the Ukrainian people in their hour of need</mark>"
39,<mark> Overall crime is up by 14%</mark>
40,<mark> This is the equivalent of hundreds of thousands more criminals getting away with their crimes</mark>
41,"<mark> One might think that, with crime up 14%, the arrest rate having halved since 2010, and prosecution rates at an alltime low, the Government might spend their time on the breadandbutter issues of law and order, such as fighting criminals</mark>"
42,"<mark> How on earth will the police know Is it fair  to our police if the law is so peculiar that they could interpret it in a million different ways, and would stand accused of bias whatever they did I urge Ministers to bear in mind the consequences of these provisions on the police officers trying to put them into practice</mark>"
43,"<mark>Throughout the proceedings on this woefully drafted Bill, I have maintained that, although it is largely reserved to England and Wales, part 3 on protest will severely restrict anyone from Scotland, or indeed anyone across these islands, from exercising their fundamental and democratic right to protest</mark>"
44,"<mark> We are back here to consider part 3 on protest, and rightly so</mark>"
45,<mark> My office also receives hundreds of emails on a daily basis asking me to stand up and act against the threat to those rights</mark>
46,<mark> 1707</mark>
47,"<mark> If we were to fastforward to a frozen conflict in which 80% of Ukraine was still sovereign, it would be entirely up to Ukraine to decide who it wanted to invite on to its territory, and for what purposes, just as it invited us there for Operation Orbital</mark>"
48,"<mark> Ukraine had British, Swedish and Canadian soldiers on its territory, and we went exercising with 5 Airborne Brigade last year; that is all possible</mark>"
49,"<mark>On behalf of the Scottish National party, I too congratulate Sir Robert Chote on his appointment</mark>"
50,"<mark> The key recommendation in that report was for 2,000 more midwives and 500 more obstetricians, and that would not have been necessary had this amendment been in place</mark>"
51,<mark> They will have no impact on improving access to care for hundreds of thousands of people currently excluded</mark>
52,"<mark> The social care cap provision does nothing to generate more care; it does nothing to give protections to unpaid carers, who are often on lower incomes but save the Government millions of pounds; and it does nothing to help the social care workforce</mark>"
53,"<mark> The changes may save the Government hundreds of millions of pounds, but they do so at the expense of those on low incomes and those who live in parts of the country where house values are lower, such as Lowestoft in my constituency</mark>"
54,"<mark> Just look at some of the challenges we face 93,000 vacancies; a £6 billion annual spend on agency staff; staff working extra unpaid hours; and some 40% off with workrelated stress at some point or other</mark>"
55,"<mark> It is already resonating among the Uyghur, who have found themselves under distinct pressure, with husbands often separated from wives and families broken apart for forced labour thousands of miles away from their homes</mark>"
56,"<mark> It is fair, affordable and designed to end the pain of unpredictable care costs by capping the amount anyone needs to pay at £86,000</mark>"
57,"<mark> As local authority contributions would count towards the cap under these changes, a 35yearold with average care costs would reach the cap and not have to pay anything towards the cost of their care, yet a person who enters care the day after their 40th birthday would need to contribute towards the £86,000 cap over their lifetime</mark>"
58,<mark> These new Lords amendments would cost the taxpayer more than £1 billion a year by 202728</mark>
59,"<mark> Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness Matt Warman and many others who have spoken in highlighting our gratitude to the NHS workforce and our recognition of the pressures they have faced, particularly over the past two to two and a half years, but also more broadly</mark>"
60,"<mark> There are different sophistications between block 1, which is just land Brimstone, and the atsea developments that we have never bought</mark>"
61,"<mark> Nor indeed were inshore vehicles, or the batch 1 offshore patrol vessels; they were not going to go anywhere else</mark>"
62,<mark>I go back to the fact that we dealt with 1 million passport applications last month alone</mark>
63,"<mark> To put that in context, we usually deal with 7 million in a whole year</mark>"
64,<mark> Last year we sent 4</mark>
65,<mark>7 million texts reminding people whose passports had expired to renew them</mark>
66,"<mark>I am extremely concerned about the safeguarding of our young people at outdoor music festivals, which attract more than 7</mark>"
67,"<mark>1 million people, many of whom are under 18</mark>"
68,"<mark>Since Putins evil invasion of Ukraine, Poland has given refuge to well over 2 million people</mark>"
69,"<mark>Relevant documents Eighth Report of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, Preappointment hearing Chair of UK Statistics Authority, HC1162; Oral evidence taken before the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee on 29 March 2022 on the preappointment hearing for the Chair of the UKSA, HC1162</mark>"
70,"<mark> As I said in round 2 of pingpong, at the Oppositions behest, we have added provisions to the Bill that can be used to limit noise and disruptive protests outside schools and vaccination centres</mark>"
71,"<mark> The cap on care costs clause is key to this Government ending unpredictable care costs for everyone by introducing a universal £86,000 cap</mark>"
72,"<mark> Government figures show that 40,000 visas have been issued under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, yet just 6,600 Ukrainians have actually arrived in the UK, because families who need to travel together cannot do so because the visa of just one family member, often a child, is delayed</mark>"
73,<mark>Less than half of 1% of Ukrainians fleeing Putins war have so far found shelter in the United Kingdom</mark>
74,<mark> It is perhaps worth reflecting on the fact that in Scotland half of all PPE is now produced locally and that the overall costs of pandemic procurement were a third less than those of the UK</mark>
75,"<mark>The Foreign Secretary is right to encourage the freezing of assets both by ourselves and by others, but what will be the conditions for unfreezing those assets Does she agree with me that all the billions owned by the kleptocrats and oligarchs ought to be turned to good purpose in due course, because we are going to need a Marshall plan eventually to rebuild Ukraine and undo the mess as best we can that the killer Putin has imposed</mark>"
76,"<mark> We have put more sanctions on than any other nation, including on oligarchs and banks, and we have supplied everything from hundreds of Starstreak antiair missiles to ammunition</mark>"
77,"<mark> Before Putins illegal invasion, Ukraine was the bread basket of Europe along with Russia, it accounted for 30% of the global wheat supply, 20% of corn, and more than 70% of sunflower oil</mark>"
78,"<mark> In fact, 12% of all calories traded in the world come from the two nations</mark>"
79,<mark> Maize and wheat posted monthonmonth increases of nearly 20%</mark>
80,"<mark> Meanwhile, the horn of Africa is facing a worsening drought which the UN says will put 20 million people at risk</mark>"
81,<mark> Many countries in north Africa and the middle east are also vulnerable because they import more than 50% of their cereal crops</mark>
82,<mark> The Secretary of State will knowshe will no doubt have got this from the emails coming into her own constituency postbagthat there are still thousands of families saying that they want to offer a home who are still waiting to be connected by her colleague the Home Secretary</mark>
83,"<mark> In Yemen alone, there is evidence that food prices have increased by 150%</mark>"
84,"<mark>Last month the UK cohosted a donor conference with the United Nations, Qatar and Germany which raised more than £2</mark>"
85,<mark>4 billion</mark>
86,"<mark> We work through international agencies to ensure that the money reaches the people who need it, and that half of it reaches women and girls, who are particularly vulnerable in Afghanistan at the moment</mark>"
87,<mark> We committed extra billions at the spring meetings last week to help to provide food aid to the rest of the world</mark>
88,"<mark>I thank the Minister for that answer, but, since the military coup on 1 February 2021, the Myanmar military has carried out brutal crackdowns aimed at suppressing widespread public opposition to its rule, and almost half a million people have been displaced, partly due to airstrikes or the threat of them</mark>"
89,"<mark>I thank everyone on the Island who has been offering to take in Ukrainian refugees and helping out in any way with the aid effort, particularly Victoria Dunford in East Cowes, whose MADAid charity has done wonderful work in Moldova and is now helping thousands of Ukrainian refugees in that part of the world</mark>"
90,"<mark>In earlier debates on 9 and 15 March, I set out my analysisfor what it is worthof the nature of Putinism in the context of postcommunist Russia, and I do not propose to try the patience of the House by repeating all that now</mark>"
91,"<mark> Thus, he waves his shiny new intercontinental ballistic missiles at the world as if it had not been the case for the  last half century that if Russia had wished to destroy the west, or if the west had wished to destroy Russia, either could have done that within the lifetime of a day</mark>"
92,"<mark> I must say to the House that, while I praise all the efforts being made on sanctions, sanctions will not affect the outcome of this war unless and until Germany stops paying billions of euros to Russia to fund it</mark>"
93,<mark> Friend the Member for Wentworth and Dearne John Healey made about the 50% rule and about tracking down intermediaries are important questions to which the Minister should respond</mark>
94,"<mark> The Government have played a key role in organising the donation and delivery of military equipment, with the Ukrainian military now equipped with hundreds of thousands of UKsupplied military equipment</mark>"
95,"<mark> We have just heard the Foreign Secretary announce that a further 6,000 antitank weapons will be provided, and over 10,000 missiles have been provided, all amounting to the provision of approximately £450 millionworth of military equipment</mark>"
96,<mark> Reports suggest that the 2022 grain harvest is likely to be 20% lower than it was in 2021 because of reduced sowing and yields following the invasion</mark>
97,<mark> It all comes down to resilience we must make sure that we have our own  domestic foodproduction agenda to ensure our food security and increase our selfsufficiency above its current level of 63%</mark>
98,"<mark> The United Kingdom was the first European country to supply lethal aid to Ukraine, and the total amount we have spent on military support is now more than £450 million and rising every dayindeed, I had to delay the departure of my right hon</mark>"
99,"<mark> We have also delivered a further 843 antitank missiles, on top of the 5,000 sent since the war began</mark>"
100,"<mark> We have donated 167 antiair missiles, including our Starstreak high velocity antiair missiles, the fastest in the world at some 2,000 miles per hour</mark>"
101,"<mark> Well, that has gone well, hasnt it Sweden and Finland are applying for membership and Germany is at long last spending more than 2% of its GDP on defence and galvanising the alliance</mark>"
102,"<mark> We have supplied 6,000 antitank weapons and 120 armoured fighting vehicles, as well as ammunition and other weapons</mark>"
103,"<mark> We are also backfilling third countries stocksfor example, by offering to deploy British Challenger 2 tanks to Poland</mark>"
104,"<mark> So far, we have designated over 1,500 individuals and entities, including more than 100 oligarchs with assets worth over £198 billion</mark>"
105,"<mark> They have donated more than £300,000,000 to the Disasters Emergency Committee and we have had the largest ever UK Government aid match of £25 million</mark>"
106,"<mark> 1 threat that we were concerned about, and it reflected that</mark>"
107,"<mark> It reported credible evidence of torture, rape, the killing of civilians and the forced deportation of over half a million peoplescenes that we thought had been consigned to history</mark>"
108,"<mark> However, according to the whistleblowing charity Protect, just 4% of employment cases are successful, and PIDA, our worldleading legislation, is now seen as a discredited and distrusted law that has failed to protect whistleblowers or the public against wrongdoing and harm</mark>"
109,<mark> A 75% failure rate against international best standards underlines the need for change</mark>
110,<mark> The National Crime Agency reports that the cost of fraud to the UK economy is £190 billion per year</mark>
111,"<mark> To put that in perspective, in the year to 2022, planned spending for the Department of Health and Social Care in England was £190 billion</mark>"
112,"<mark> We are providing the World Service with over £90 million this year, but we have also created a Government information cell to counter Russian information and ensure that the people of Russia can access the truth</mark>"
113,"<mark> Will the Secretary of State make representations to her Saudi counterparts, on behalf of the House, to prevent such a grotesque miscarriage of justice and violation of the rights of the child</mark>"
114,<mark> We are doing everything from sending manned Challenger 2 tanks to Poland to doubling the size of our deployment  in Estonia</mark>
115,"<mark> We had issues with part 2 of the Bill, but these were mainly procedural and are, I hope, open to correction in the light of experience</mark>"
116,"<mark> Our objections to part 1 are more fundamental, and we are grateful to the other place for highlighting these in Lords amendments 1 to 5</mark>"
117,"<mark> Lords amendments 1 to 3, in the name of the noble Lord Marks, remove prospectiveonly quashing orders from the Bill</mark>"
118,<mark> It was not recommended by the independent review of administrative law that was supposed to found the basis of part 1 of the Bill</mark>
119,"<mark> That fact is given away by the clunking fist of the presumption in favour of prospective orders and of suspended orders, which clause 1 also sought to introduce</mark>"
120,"<mark> In a step bordering on the disrespectful, the Minister sought to tie the hands of the court in applying its discretionary powers, so I am delighted the Government have seen the light and do not today oppose Lords amendment 4, in the name of Lord Anderson</mark>"
121,<mark> That extracts the worst of the sting in clause 1</mark>
122,<mark> Lords amendment 5 narrows the ambit of Cart so that in the majority of cases there is no onward right of appeal</mark>
123,"<mark> All that has been argued in the other place, and votes wonalbeit narrowlyon amendments 1 and 5</mark>"
124,"<mark> We accept that that is a significant concession, and we do not intend to press any votes on the Lords amendments clauses 1 and 2 today</mark>"
125,<mark> 1736</mark>
126,"<mark>I rise to speak to Lords amendments 1, 2 and 3, all tabled by Lord Marks in the other place</mark>"
127,"<mark> Unamended, the Bill is described by the Law Society as chilling; clauses 1 and 2 undermine judicial review</mark>"
128,"<mark> I urge Members across the House to do the same and vote in favour of Lords amendments 1, 2 and 3</mark>"
129,"<mark> Given that people were being charged up to £1,200, that was a great outcome that will have made a big difference to many</mark>"
130,"<mark> The Scottish National party therefore absolutely supports the very sensible Lords amendments 1, 2 and 3</mark>"
131,"<mark> Lords amendment 4 removed the presumption, which provided that a court would have to use the new quashing order powers if they offered adequate redress and there was no good reason not to do so</mark>"
132,<mark> Lords amendments 1 to 3 remove prospective quashing orders from the Bill</mark>
133,"<mark> Member for Hammersmith Andy Slaughter for recognising that we have made a significant concession on the presumption; we, in turn, are grateful for having been enabled to bring important reforms to judicial review through clauses 1 and 2</mark>"
134,"<mark> My concern about the Lords amendments to clauses 1 and 2 is that their effect would be to go furtherI am sure that it was not intentionalthan their lordships usual role of providing close scrutiny and careful amendment, where the principle of the Bill is maintained but some of the details are altered</mark>"
135,"<mark> Member for Hammersmith Andy Slaughter, for indicating that Her Majestys Opposition would not seek Divisions on amendments to the clauses in part 1</mark>"
136,<mark> I make no apology about the provisions in clause 1</mark>
137,<mark> That is what clause 2 is all about</mark>
138,"<mark> We know that we all have hundreds of families in our constituencies who wish to take partthat is particularly the case in Stroud and Gloucestershire, because people have put their hands up quicklyso it makes no sense that the option available to families if a relationship breaks down or if there is a problem with the host is that they end up in a homelessness situation</mark>"
139,"<mark> Is it not safe to say that the only thing he succeeded in last week was getting 4,000 miles away from his BackBenchers</mark>"
140,"<mark> Products such as Scotch whisky, let alone cars, currently face tariffs of more than 100%, so there could be particular benefits for the people of Scotland in agreeing this trade deal</mark>"
141,"<mark> India is one of the worlds oldest democracies and there is a unique living bridge, including a 1</mark>"
142,"<mark>6 millionstrong Indian diaspora in the UK, that connects our countries in so many ways</mark>"
143,"<mark> It could supercharge the growth of our trading relationship, which already totalled more than £23 billion in 2019</mark>"
144,"<mark> Members would expect, nearly 100,000 sets of rations, 10 pallets of medical equipment, 3,000 pieces of body armour, nearly 8,000 helmets and 3,000 pairs of boots</mark>"
145,"<mark> This week, another 4,000 nightvision devices will also be sent to Ukraine</mark>"
146,<mark> Friend for her outstanding work across the world on the Prime Ministers behalf as his envoy on freedom of religion or belief</mark>
147,"<mark>I think the Government are to be strongly commended for all the economic sanctions work they are doing, but how can that prove effective as long as Germany is pumping billions of euros into the Russian economy week in, week out for oil and gas</mark>"
148,"<mark> UK businesses also confirmed more than £1 billion of new investments and export deals, creating almost 11,000 jobs here in the UK</mark>"
149,"<mark> Globally, we also committed up to £75 million to rolling out adaptable clean tech innovations from India to the wider IndoPacific and to Africa</mark>"
150,"<mark> 83A7,</mark>"
151,"<mark> It is estimated that some 2,000 Russian armoured vehicles, 60 aircraft, and two key naval assets have been either destroyed or captured, with around 15,000 Russian personnel reportedly killed, all as a result of Vladimir Putins arrogance</mark>"
152,"<mark> Sadly, the thousands of Ukrainians waiting for visas and their expectant hosts have seen those failings at first hand</mark>"
153,<mark> One such gap was that Ukrainians in the UK on tier 2 visas were unable to sponsor their family members to arrive under the first scheme</mark>
154,"<mark> As I have been travelling across Stirling district, an area slightly bigger than Luxembourg, I have seen hundreds of Ukrainian flags in farms, houses, cars and windows</mark>"
155,"<mark> I pay tribute to the many individuals and organisations across my constituency who have been mobilising support, fundraising and donating what they can to help refugees, and the hundreds who have offered their homes as a place of sanctuary</mark>"
156,"<mark> She left her children with friends and drove 1,500 miles to the edge of her wartorn country to pick her mother up</mark>"
157,<mark> Britain is one of the only countries that has met its NATO duty to spend 2% on defence every single year since the target was created in 2006</mark>
158,"<mark> All people have a right to freedom and democracy, including the 44 million people in Ukraine</mark>"
159,"<mark> We have supplied £220 million of funding, we are helping refugees and we are delivering food, medicine and other essentials</mark>"
160,"<mark> Our overall package of humanitarian, economic and military support is worth $2 billion</mark>"
161,<mark> Friend update the House on the £40 million support package over 10 years that was announced in 2016 for the Chagos island community</mark>
162,"<mark>I beg to move, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 1</mark>"
163,<mark>I rise to speak chiefly to part 1 of the Bill</mark>
164,<mark> We have barred over 3 million Russian companies from raising money on our capital markets</mark>
165,"<mark> In the face of the appalling crisis in Ukraine, we have already committed £220 million of development funding, and we are one of the largest donors</mark>"
166,"<mark> We are working closely with many Commonwealth partners on global challenges such as climate and health, underpinned by over half a billion pounds of international investment</mark>"
167,"<mark>Had the Prime Minister been here today, I would have inquired of him whether, while he was in India, he impressed on the Indian Prime Minister the fact that the £2 billion increase in trade with Russia at a time when we had sanctioned it in respect of Ukraine potentially undermined  our position, and whether he tried to persuade the Prime Minister of India that that was not an acceptable route for a UK trading partner</mark>"
168,"<mark> I will ask an easy one can she tell us, for the record, about the Governments bestcase scenario of a boost to UKIndia trade from this agreement, and does it come anywhere near to touching the sides of the provenas calculated by the London School of Economics and published this morningdecline of 25% in UK exports to the EU relative to the rest of the world</mark>"
169,"<mark> We believe that this could significantly increase, and indeed supercharge, the trade between our two countries, which already totals over £23 billion</mark>"
170,"<mark> I mentioned that Scotch whisky has a tariff of over 100%, and cars do as well</mark>"
171,"<mark>During the meeting, UK and Indian businesses confirmed more than £1 billion in new investments and export deals, creating more than 11,000 jobs in the United Kingdom</mark>"
172,"<mark> I could go and vote on behalf of my stepfather by taking something that demonstrates that I am him, because I can just take it off his desk</mark>"
173,"<mark> 83A7,</mark>"
174,<mark>Channel 4 is a prized national asset that was created by Margaret Thatcher 40 years ago</mark>
175,"<mark> It puts public service before profit and continues to be sustainable, so why are the Government failing to consider its detailed plans to address their concerns The plans were set out very clearly in a document entitled 4 The Next Episode, which was provided to the Government on 28 January this year</mark>"
176,"<mark> Lady for her question and her concern, but I do not think that anything we seek to do in relation to Channel 4 would deprive lowincome families of freetoair content on it</mark>"
177,<mark> Channel 4 has made really great strides in the digital space</mark>
178,"<mark>Under private ownership, Channel 4s output will be dictated by profit rather than public service, and I share the concerns about creative risk taking and the impact on diversity when commissioning contentwould we see Derry Girls, The Last Leg and Mo Gilligan Does the Minister agree that private ownership will dilute, rather than enrich, broadcasters programming</mark>"
179,"<mark> As I said, 90% of applications submitted in that time were dealt with in six weeks</mark>"

188,"<mark> Member for Kensington Felicity Buchan incorrectly claimed that council tax is lower in Conservative councils; according to the Governments own live figures, the average council tax bill for a Conservative council is £1,642 while the average for a Labour council is £1,313</mark>"
189,"<mark> So, Conservative council tax billsthis is a factare £329 higher than Labour council tax bills</mark>"
190,"<mark>My Conservative council in Kensington and Chelsea charges £500 less council tax than neighbouring Labour Camden, and it has four times as many bin collections</mark>"
191,<mark> You have not misheard £500 less; four times as many</mark>
192,"<mark> Member for Gedling intervened; it looks as though only 70% of people will actually do that, so we are still looking at a number of people dropping out of the system altogether</mark>"
193,"<mark> I echo concerns that others have raised that the privatisation of Channel 4 might jeopardise its investment in communities across the UK as part of its public service remit, and its quotas relating to commissioning content in each nation of the United Kingdom</mark>"
194,"<mark> That investment has amounted to more than £77 million in Wales in the past 10 years, and supported over 200 jobs in 2019 alone</mark>"
195,<mark>Channel 4 spent £516 million on original content in 2006</mark>
196,<mark> That number fell to £329 million because advertising incomes fell at a similar pace</mark>
197,"<mark> Friend agree that unless we do something, Channel 4 is at risk of stagnating, and that we can keep a similar news remit, commitment to diversity and investment in nations and regions in a different model</mark>"
198,"<mark> In recognition of what he says, the reason that previous Secretaries of State looked at this matter was that they could see a number of trends, particularly on spend on linear advertising, that were only going in the wrong direction for a broadcaster like Channel 4, which is uniquely dependent on that spend</mark>"
199,<mark> Something like 70% of its revenues come from linear advertising spend</mark>
200,"<mark> He will be aware that a number of things can be done in terms of remit and how we engineer the sale to ensure that what is unique, distinct and valued about Channel 4 can be maintained and protected going forward</mark>"
201,"<mark> Lady is right to highlight the great investment that Channel 4 has made in Leeds, which was actually at the encouragement of previous Secretaries of State when we previously looked at the question of privatisation</mark>"
202,"<mark> In our relationship with Channel 4, we have encouraged it to seek to increase what it does in the regions and nations of our country, and we think it has done a great job of that</mark>"
203,<mark> We hope that that blend will sustain Channel 4 long into the future</mark>
204,<mark> He is right to celebrate Channel 4</mark>
205,"<mark> I welcome the interest of any company that wants to do to Channel 4 what has happened to Channel Five, with the highquality programming that it provides</mark>"
206,<mark>The Government are thinking carefully about the fundamental sustainability and future of the Channel 4 model</mark>
207,"<mark> Gentleman may be aware of two key points about Channel 4 it does not retain ownership of its intellectual property, and any borrowing it does sits on the public balance sheet</mark>"
208,"<mark> Given its dependence on linear advertising, we have concerns, looking at viewer trends, that that model will be difficult to sustain if Channel 4 is to continue to make the investment in content that I think we all want</mark>"
209,"<mark> We are therefore looking afresh at what Channel 4 needs, not only to sustain itself, but to grow</mark>"
210,"<mark>I may have my facts wrong, but as I understand it, Channel 4 is phenomenally successful</mark>"
211,"<mark> Its subscription service levels are something like a third higher than Netflixs in the UK, and All 4 is the largest subscription service in this country</mark>"
212,"<mark> Channel 4 does not cost the taxpayer anything, yet it generates £1 billion per year for the UK economy</mark>"
213,<mark> She knew so little about Channel 4 that she thought it was publicly funded and had to be corrected by a Tory colleague on camera</mark>

228,<mark> The relevant part of the Bill is discriminatory and will disenfranchise millions of people</mark>
229,"<mark>It is a pleasure to speak in this debate, as I have at every stage of this Bill, and I am sure the Minister will agree that it is nice to be on the home stretch after so long, especially as she very bravely took over halfway through</mark>"
230,"<mark> I should like to know whether the Electoral Commission will answer that question this week rather than next week, whether it would require evidence to be gathered both by itself and by the police lest there should be a case afterwards, and whether Mr Speaker might be able to take this up at 4 pm, when he is due to have a private meeting on the Electoral Commission</mark>"

232,<mark> Will there be that commitment to prime time news for Channel 4 under a new ownership model</mark>
233,"<mark>Our TV and radio industry is one of our great success stories, and public service broadcasters such as Channel 4 are central to that success</mark>"
234,"<mark> As a result, while streaming services have enjoyed a 19% increase in subscribers in recent years, the share of total viewers for linear TV channels such as the BBC and ITV has fallen by more than 20%</mark>"
235,"<mark> Tomorrow, therefore, we will be publishing a White Paper that proposes major reforms to our decadesold broadcasting regulationsreforms that will put traditional broadcasters such as the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 on an even playing field with Netflix, Amazon Prime and others, and enable them to thrive in the streaming age</mark>"
236,"<mark> The independent production sector has exploded in the last few decades, growing from a £500 million industry in 1995 to an industry of approximately £3 billion in 2019</mark>"
237,"<mark> However, since it was structured to address the challenges of the 1980s, there are limits to Channel 4s ability to adapt to the 2020s and beyond</mark>"
238,"<mark> Streamers such as Netflix spent £779 million on UK productions in 2020, more than twice as much as Channel 4</mark>"
239,"<mark> While other PSBs, such as the BBC and Channel 5, have the freedom to make and sell their own content, Channel 4 has no inhouse studio and relies almost entirely on linear television advertising spend at a time when those revenues are rapidly shifting online</mark>"
240,"<mark> The Government believe that it is time to unleash the broadcasters full potential and to open Channel 4 up to private ownership and investmentcrucially, while protecting its public service broadcasting remit</mark>"
241,"<mark> We believe we can sell Channel 4 to a buyer who will fund emerging talent and independent and impartial news, and invest in every corner of the UK</mark>"
242,<mark> Only 7% of its revenue comes from Channel 4</mark>
243,"<mark> We need to give people the skills to fill the jobs in them, so we will reinvest the proceeds of a Channel 4 sale into levelling up the creative sector and giving people in leftbehind areas the training and opportunity to work in the industry</mark>"
244,"<mark> As I said, the future of Channel 4 is just one part of our wider reform of the entire broadcasting sector, and I look forward to providing the House with the full details shortly</mark>"
245,"<mark> Channel 4 is an incredibly important economic asset in that ecosystem, and we want to make sure that it is sustainable not just now but long into the future</mark>"
246,<mark> We think it is our responsibility as the Government to do that futuregazing and to make sure that Channel 4 has the freedom and flexibility it needs to be able to make changes to thrive</mark>
247,<mark> We had very much hoped that we would be able to set the sale of Channel 4 in the context of a wider series of incredibly important reforms that we wish to make to the public service broadcasting sector</mark>
248,"<mark> We think that we can get the right blend by retaining Channel 4s public service broadcast remit, which maintains its distinct and unique appeal, while enabling it to get the private sector capital investment that it requires to deal with some of the wider challenges presented by the likes of Netflix</mark>"
249,"<mark> If Channel 4 is to remain uniquely appealing, we need that investment in content, and we believe that the reforms will give it greater sustainability going forward</mark>"
250,"<mark> In this country, we are able to have a great blend of specific public service remits that private broadcasters can deliver, and that is what we would seek to do with Channel 4 going forward, protecting the things that we enjoy and love about it</mark>"
251,<mark> We believe that any future buyer of Channel 4 would seek to purchase it precisely to tap into the specific markets that it appeals to</mark>
252,"<mark> Channel 4 has fundamentally accepted those concerns in providing us with a range of alternative options, which we have looked at very carefully</mark>"
253,<mark> Gentleman needs to understand that we are not seeking to have a subscription model for Channel 4</mark>
254,"<mark>Urgent Question To ask the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on the privatisation of Channel 4</mark>"
255,"<mark>Up and down the country, public service broadcasters, such as Channel 4, the BBC and ITV, are treasured national assets, delivering vital news, education, entertainment and sport</mark>"
256,"<mark> Friend is working with me to help to improve that situation in rural Cumbria, but please, please can I urge the Government to rethink this Channel 4 privatisation idea Now is the time to support and bolster our public service broadcasters, not challenge them or lead them to being a competitive, subscriptionbased service, which is the last thing that our rural communities need</mark>"
257,"<mark> Friend was right, of course, to say that previous Secretaries of State have considered the privatisation of Channel 4, but she will also recognise that not all of us were persuaded at the time that it was the right thing to do</mark>"
258,"<mark> If the Government are determined to privatise Channel 4, she will also recognise, I am sure, that one of the things that makes Channel 4 distinctive is its willingness to take risks and commission work it cannot be sure will be successful</mark>"
259,<mark> Channel 4 will be gobbled up in no time by someone like the richest man in the world</mark>
260,<mark> That would not have happened without Channel 4</mark>
261,<mark> There are 81 jobs in Northern Ireland supported directly by Channel 4</mark>
262,<mark> It contributes £8 million annually to Northern Irelands GVA</mark>
263,<mark> Over a quarter of £1 billion is contributed to Northern Ireland as a result of television and film making</mark>
264,"<mark> I grew up not too far from the Central Independent Television studios in Nottingham and have been a fan of Channel 4 over the years, particularly Fifteen to One, Football Italia, and my favourite, The Crystal Maze</mark>"
265,"<mark> I am not too sure which zone the Opposition are in today, but does the Minister agree that this deal not only makes really good financial sense for the Government, but allows the purchasers of Channel 4 to raise capital to produce even more of the independent programming that we all value</mark>"
266,"<mark> Working people are looking for help, but this week millions will look at their payslip and see a tax rise with his fingerprints all over it</mark>"
267,<mark> Five hundred thousand more peopleInterruption</mark>
268,"<mark> Under Labour, just to remind everybody, youth unemployment rose by 45%</mark>"
269,<mark> The national insurance contribution went down by an average of £330</mark>
270,"<mark>What we are doing for working people is not only lifting the living wage by a record amount and helping people on universal credit with a £1,000 tax cut, but cutting national insurance contributions and lifting the threshold so that, on average, people pay £330 less</mark>"
271,<mark> Half a million moreInterruption</mark>
272,"<mark> Gentleman asks about universal credit; we are tapering it so that working people get another £1,000 in their pocket</mark>"
273,<mark> By giving £0</mark>
274,"<mark>5 billion more to councils, we are making sure that we look after the types of people to whom the right hon</mark>"
275,"<mark> The Scottish Government have introduced, and now doubled, the gamechanging Scottish child payment of at least £1,040 a year, helping those families who are being hit the hardest</mark>"
276,"<mark> Here are three other ideas for the Prime Minister that would help families with their soaring costs right now scrapping his national insurance tax hike, reversing the Tory cuts to universal credit and matching Scotlands 6% benefits rise instead of imposing a realterms cut</mark>"
277,<mark> Those are three things that would make a difference to millions of people</mark>
278,"<mark> This Bill is littered with various things we have voted against throughout the process, in relation to voting, to political finance and to electoral systems, but today we are really down to just two issues voter ID, as set out in part 1 of the Bill; and the independence of the Electoral Commission, as set out in part 3</mark>"
279,<mark> Nearly half of them do not have any photographic ID</mark>
280,"<mark> When electoral ID was first introduced in Northern Ireland, there was a £2 charge</mark>"
281,"<mark> Member for Torbay Kevin Foster, spoke about in the urgent question, where extra staff were employed and a million passports were processed in one month</mark>"
282,"<mark> Member for Hayes and Harlington, and they are sitting at around 60% with no voter ID; in my constituency in Northern Ireland, where voter ID is required, turnout is higher</mark>"
283,"<mark> I stood for election in my constituency in 92 when poll tax had been introduced and 5,000 people dropped off the register thereby the sound of it, most of them were Labour voters because I lost by 54 votes</mark>"
284,<mark> I did not suggest that Channel 4 would pursue a Netflix subscription model; I simply made the point that Netflix and othersthis is not a Netflix issue aloneare changing the dynamics of the marketplace very rapidly</mark>
285,<mark> She took the responsible decision to look not just at Channel 4 but at how we ensure that public service broadcasters have the flexibility they need to be able to provide the content that we all love</mark>
286,"<mark> Friend plays an important role through her work with the allparty parliamentary group for Channel 4, and I am glad for the engagement that we have already had on the issue</mark>"
287,<mark> Friend raises the alternatives that Channel 4s management put forward</mark>
288,<mark> Our reforms are really to sustain Channel 4s place in in our creative ecology</mark>
289,<mark> I simply refer him to my previous answers we would maintain Channel 4 as a freetoair service</mark>
290,<mark> Channel 4 is intrinsic to making all of that work because it does something that no other broadcaster in the world ever did it guarantees diversity through the private sector for everybody</mark>
291,"<mark>All 4 is the UKs largest freeofcharge streaming service, providing entertainment and educational programming across the UK, without regard to users income, which is particularly important in this economic crisis</mark>"
292,"<mark> The staff union, the Public and Commercial Services Union, has claimed that the Passport Office planned to recruit 1,700 new staff members to help deal with this increased demand, but only 300 have actually been brought in so far</mark>"
293,"<mark>In the year before covid, the aviation industry contributed £22 billion to the UK economy and £3</mark>"
294,"<mark>6 billion to the Exchequer through air passenger duty, and it is expected to be at 70% demand this summer, so we cannot put this at risk, for the sake of our economy</mark>"
295,"<mark> I would also make the point again that 90% of applications were completed within six weeks, and the service standard is 10 weeks</mark>"
296,"<mark> It was 13% higher than the previous record, so we are talking about it beating that record not by one but by some distance</mark>"
297,"<mark> As I said, there are 500 extra staff and we are in the process of recruiting more; between January and March, 90% of applications were dealt with within six weeks; and support is there</mark>"
298,"<mark> To be clear, those staff have now fully returned to passport production, and on 1 April more than 4,000 staff were working on it</mark>"
299,"<mark> Last year, we sent 4</mark>"
300,<mark>7 million texts to those who had not renewed their passport to try to encourage more people to get their passport applications in</mark>
301,"<mark> As I have touched on several times, we saw record output last month, with over 1 million passports dealt with in just one month, whereas normally we deal with 7 million across a whole year</mark>"
302,"<mark> As of 1 April, there were more than 4,000 staff in passport production roles</mark>"
303,"<mark>Again, let us go back to what we have already said 4</mark>"
304,"<mark>7 million texts were sent out last year; 1 million passports were issued last montha record amount; more staff are being recruited; and existing staff, if they wish, are being given the opportunity to work incentivised overtime</mark>"
305,"<mark> There has been a large amount of planning and work done to meet the challenge, but inevitably, with 2</mark>"
306,"<mark>5 million extra passport applications due this year, on top of the 7 million that we expect to receive from those whose passports fall due this year, there were going to be pressures in the system</mark>"
307,"<mark> As I said, between January and March, 90% of people got their passport within six weeks</mark>"
308,<mark> I can assure him that we are absolutely determined that this will be article 2compliant</mark>
309,<mark>The Road Haulage Association has confirmed that the cost of moving goods from this part of the United Kingdom to Northern Ireland has risen by 27% in the first year of the operation of the protocol</mark>
310,<mark>Channel 4 has been a driver of the independent sector</mark>
311,"<mark> She spent £7,000 on a holiday and is due to fly out on Sunday</mark>"
312,"<mark> I echo the comments about the staff in the Belfast office, who are assiduous in their response on behalf of our constituents</mark>"
313,"<mark>Prior to the pandemic, HM Passport Office routinely processed approximately 7 million passports each year</mark>"
314,<mark> Over the last two years the necessary restrictions on international travel meant only 4 million people applied for a British passport in 2020 and 5 million in 2021</mark>
315,<mark> This left about 5 million unrenewed passports</mark>
316,<mark> We expect this year to deal with 9</mark>
317,<mark>5 million British passport applications and have been planning for this</mark>
318,"<mark> These preparations ensured passport applications could be processed in record numbers, last month seeing the highest total for any month on record, with HM Passport Office completing the processing of over 1 million applications, 13% higher than the previous record output</mark>"
319,"<mark> The vast majority of applications continue to be processed within 10 weeks; in fact, over 90% of applications were issued within 6 weeks between January and March 2022, despite the muchincreased demand</mark>"
320,"<mark> Their hard work will enable millions of British citizens to enjoy a holiday abroad this summer, and I thank them for that</mark>"
321,"<mark> I reassure people that, as I touched on, 90% of applications were done in six weeks</mark>"
322,"<mark>As we have touched on, we are seeing an unprecedented level of demand we would normally process 7 million applications in an entire year and did 1 million last month alone</mark>"
323,"<mark> As I said, though, in recent months 90% of people have still been getting their passport within six weeks and we retain the ability to expedite if people have particularly compelling reasons for travel</mark>"
324,"<mark> I do not expect that would massively mitigate the number of applications we are receiving, given that during the pandemic 5 million passports were not renewed, and we expect a lot of people will now want to renew, looking ahead to summer holiday travel, but I certainly welcome the right hon</mark>"
325,"<mark> As I said, there are 5 million unrenewed passports and we expect 2</mark>"
326,"<mark>5 million of them to be renewed, and that is on top of the normal 7 millionstrong demand each year</mark>"
327,"<mark> Last month we processed over 1 million applications, which is 30% higher than the previous record, and 90% of those between January and March were done within six weeks</mark>"
328,"<mark> Certainly, 90% between January and March were issued within six weeks, so not the 10week standard, and over 1 million were issued last month</mark>"
329,<mark> We sent out 4</mark>
330,<mark>7 million texts to people who had not renewed their passports to point out that there might be a surge if they wished to travel in the following year</mark>
331,"<mark> As I say, we are still managing to deal with most passport applications relatively quickly, with over 90% issued with six weeks</mark>"
332,<mark> No other month has seen over 1 million passports issued</mark>
333,"<mark> In terms of being low on delivery, we delivered more than 1 million passport decisions last montha record number</mark>"
334,"<mark> With a holiday booked in May, they risk losing thousands and thousands of pounds if they are unable to travel</mark>"
335,"<mark> In 2020 and 2021, the Home Office was asked what it was doing to plan, but people are already losing holidays, trips to see loved ones and thousands of pounds that they have spent in good faith because of the lack of planning at the Passport Office and at the Home Office, which is in danger of becoming a StayatHome Office instead for people this summer</mark>"
336,"<mark>There has been a spike in demand for passports, but that should have been anticipated since we know that 5 million people put off renewing their passport during lockdown</mark>"
337,<mark> We will be unveiling very shortly another very exciting proposala competition in Northern Irelands schools for something to be presented to Her Majesty on behalf of the young people of Northern Ireland</mark>
338,"<mark>The Minister said in his opening remarks that over 90% of applications were meeting the timescales, but the particular problems, based on my own casework, seem to be with firsttime applications and children</mark>"
339,<mark>Some 4</mark>
340,<mark>5 million people pay for their gas and electricity through a prepayment meter</mark>
341,<mark> We are putting in £9</mark>
342,"<mark>1 billion, with an immediate £150 cut in peoples council tax</mark>"
343,<mark> Labours thing raises only £6</mark>
344,"<mark>6 billion, and it clobbers the very businesses that we need to invest in energy to bring the prices down for people across this country</mark>"
345,<mark> I am delighted that Mansfield was awarded £12 million as part of the towns fund</mark>
346,"<mark> Amendment a will require the Secretary of State, when preparing a statement, to have regard to the duty placed on the commission by section 1451 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 to monitor and ensure compliance with the rules set out in that Act</mark>"
347,<mark> These amendments provide for enhanced parliamentary scrutiny of a statement that has been subject to statutory consultation under new section 4C of the 2000 Act by providing both Houses with a supplementary opportunity to consider the draft statement and make representations before it is laid for approval</mark>
348,"<mark> It was therefore necessary for the Government to table Lords amendments 6 to 8, 13, 14, 24 to 28, 30 to 33, 37, 38, 40 to 43, 46 to 48, 51 to 63, 88 to 102, 117, 125 and 126 to ensure the measures apply to reserved matters only</mark>"
349,"<mark> Rightly, much has been made of the calibre of some of Channel 4s programming, but tonights schedule includes The Great Home Transformation, Grand Designs The Streets, Bling Ring Hollywood Heist and Shocking Emergency Calls UK</mark>"
350,<mark> We think that any future buyer would look at the unique and distinct content that Channel 4 provides as one of its great assets</mark>
351,"<mark> We are able to protect some of that via the remit, which we would seek to do, but it is also important that Channel 4 is only one part of why the creative sector has been very successful in Northern Ireland</mark>"
352,<mark>I very much welcome the opportunity to talk in this House about The Crystal Maze and the fantastic content that Channel 4 has produced over the years</mark>
353,<mark> Our reforms are fundamentally about making sure that Channel 4 can continue to make the investments that my hon</mark>
354,"<mark> Given the cost of living crisis, why push ahead with forcing a successful, publicly owned Channel 4 to adopt a privately financed model when subscriptions are becoming a luxury that many people and families simply cannot afford</mark>"
355,<mark> Channel 4 is in the best state that it has been in creatively or financially for decades</mark>
356,"<mark> If they do not, they could engage with Channel 4s management team about its proposalsI am not sure that we have all seen them in publicand explain why they prefer to go to the United States than to have a state broadcaster that is independent of Government</mark>"
357,"<mark> Alongside the £617 million in city and growth deal funding, the levelling up, community renewal and community ownership funds have invested £62 million to date in the people and places most in need in Northern Ireland as a demonstration of our commitment to the people of Northern Ireland</mark>"
358,"<mark> We certainly accept the point that there need to be significant improvements in the performance of the advice line and the MPs line, and we are already engaging with Home Office teams about how we can get more resources in so that people can have their queries answered, particularly when Members of Parliament raise issues on behalf of those with compelling and compassionate reasons for travel and therefore need their application to be expedited</mark>"
359,<mark>Independent production companies across our nations and regions rely on Channel 4s current operating model</mark>
360,"<mark> Channel 4 is an  important public service broadcaster, but that does not mean that it has to be owned by the Government</mark>"
361,"<mark> We will be looking at bidders who share our vision for Channel 4, the important role that it plays in investment in our creative industries and the distinct and unique remit that it has in our country</mark>"
362,"<mark>The selloff of Channel 4 is an important matter for Parliament, yet instead of a statement we had announcement by tweet during recess, and now we hear that a White Paper is to be published tomorrow, when we will not be here and there will not be an opportunity for statements</mark>"
363,<mark> Nothing screams rudderless Government like fixating on the governance of Channel 4 while peoples energy bills are going through the roof</mark>
364,"<mark> Is it to help level up the country Given that Channel 4 commissions half its budget outside London, creating a pipeline of talent across the nations and regions, and stimulating the creative economy in places such as Leeds, Glasgow and Bristol, of course it is not</mark>"
365,"<mark> Or is it to save the Treasury money I know that the Secretary of State was a bit confused about this in front of the Select Committee, but Channel 4 does not cost the taxpayer a single penny</mark>"
366,"<mark> She says the selloff will generate a pot of up to £1 billion for her to dish out in grants, but Channel 4 already invests that amount here, commercially, each and every year</mark>"
367,"<mark> She says she will protect the essence of Channel 4 in a new remit, but I thought that was the straitjacket she wanted to free it from</mark>"
368,"<mark> Channel 4 is a great British asset, owned by the public, that does not cost them a penny</mark>"
369,"<mark> As the Member of Parliament for Bradford West, Channel 4 in Leeds makes a real difference to diversity, especially in news channels and in journalism as a whole</mark>"
370,"<mark> Can the Minister assure me that if we go down that road and they privatise it, the buyer will be required to maintain the presence and trajectory of workforce growth in Channel 4s regional offices in Leeds, Glasgow, Bristol and Manchester</mark>"
371,"<mark> May I therefore urge on the Minister the very Conservative action of listening to the voice of small businessthe many small businesses and creative companiesthat Members from all sides of the House are praising because they provide innovation, creativity and jobs around the country, precisely serving the levellingup agenda Can she tell us, having looked at the consultation responses the Government have not published, what is the overwhelming voice from those small businesses They are all saying that Channel 4 is not broke and does not need fixing in this way</mark>"
372,"<mark> For the supply chain, it will mean laying off up to 2,000 workers</mark>"
373,"<mark>Channel 4 invests about £20 million a year in Scottish independent production companies, contributing £36 million in gross  value added and supporting about 400 jobs</mark>"
374,"<mark> Glasgowbased indies do get contracts with Netflix and the others, but they are clear that the Channel 4 model is at the heart of their success</mark>"
375,"<mark>How do the proposals genuinely fit in with our levellingup agenda What protections and safeguards would be put in place to ensure that Channel 4s HQ not only stays in Leeds, but continues to flourish there What safeguards can be put on Channel 4s excellent commitment to quality regional TV production so that it can continue to flourish, particularly because Channel 4 currently invests more in independent production companies outside London than any other broadcaster and supports thousands of jobs outside London</mark>"

394,"<mark> Does he agree that the UK Government have thus far committed £41 million to that project However, that was not what I wanted to intervene on; I wanted to intervene on his mention of the £500 million just transition fund for the northeast of Scotland</mark>"
395,"<mark> Members for Kilmarnock and Loudoun Alan Brown and for Aberdeen South Stephen Flynn have not been able to do thus far, and describe in detail what that £500 million will be spent on in the northeast of Scotland</mark>"

400,<mark> Inflation stands at 7% and rising; household bills have gone up by hundreds of pounds; the cost of the weekly shop has rocketed; and people are seeing their wages run out much earlier in the month and the value of their savings fall</mark>
401,"<mark> That would take £400 off energy bills every year and cut gas imports by 15%, but this Prime Minister is far too concerned with vanity projects ever to prioritise investment in insulating homes</mark>"
402,"<mark> If the Tories had simply matched Labours record on growth in Government, people would have had higher incomes, boosting public finances, and we could have spent over £40 billion more on public services without having to raise a single tax</mark>"

405,"<mark> The average household bill is now about £2,000 a year, and in October it could rise to almost £3,000</mark>"
406,"<mark> For those who are the most vulnerable in our country, the choice is do they feed themselves or do they put the heating on Similarly, one small business owner explained to me recently how his energy bill is going up from £1,200 a month now to £2,400 in June</mark>"

409,<mark> Germany saw growth over the same period of over 13% in its exports</mark>
410,"<mark> Across the G7, average growth in exports was 10%, yet Britain, under the Conservative party over the same decade, managed growth of just 4%</mark>"
411,"<mark> Indeed, where is the serious plan to tackle the climate crisis If the Government had backed the Oppositions plans, we could double our onshore wind capacity to power an extra 10 million homes, back tidal power, triple solar power by 2030 and accelerate energy insulation to reduce the bills of working families and pensioners</mark>"
412,"<mark> British banking is dominated by four large banks, which provide 70% of current accounts</mark>"
413,<mark> It did not do so during the LV debacle and almost £35 million of owners money was wasted as a result</mark>
414,"<mark> In time, there will, I am sure, be much for us to be proud of about the councils actions under Labour control, particularly the response to covid, but we have to confront now the question of whether, despite cuts in Government funding to Harrow Council of more than 90%, better council services could have been provided</mark>"
415,"<mark> It comes in a context where we have seen the Tory vote across Scotland  collapse, with the Labour revival amounting nationally to no more than a lacklustre 1</mark>"
416,<mark>6% increase in first preference votes on the council elections in 2017 and its secondworst local government performance since devolution in 1999</mark>

418,"<mark> As well as the attacks on Scotlands democratically elected Parliament, which are set to continue, our resource budget allocation has been cut by Westminster by 5</mark>"
419,<mark>2% and the capital budget allocation has been cut by 9</mark>

427,"<mark> Gentleman does not want his speech dominated by the Northern Ireland issue, but will he accept that the Northern Ireland protocol is not only adding significantly to the cost of living crisis in Northern Ireland and slowing down the Northern Ireland economys recovery from covid, but poisoning the very essence of the Belfast agreement, and therefore stopping the working of the institutions It removes democracy, because not only Unionist Members, but all Members of the Assembly will have no say on 60% of the laws</mark>"
428,"<mark> They could have chosen to ask energy companies to share a little of their grotesque wealth, or they could have asked landlords and property billionaires to pay a little more</mark>"
429,"<mark> In my constituency alone, the Scottish Government are forced to spend £11</mark>"
430,<mark>8 million each year to mitigate the worst of what Westminster throws at us</mark>
431,"<mark> As an aside, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Anna Cookson and the team on BBC Radio Kents  The Wake Up Call on, a week ago, winning an ARIAAudio and Radio Industry Awardin the teeth of competition from, I believe, the Today programme, Radio 5 Live and others</mark>"
432,"<mark> I am not philosophically opposed to the privatisation of Channel 4, but I do believe we are in danger of throwing a baby out with the bathwater</mark>"
433,"<mark> I hope very much that if we are going to continue to go down this road, we take great care to seek to secure the future of the independent production industry that Channel 4 has fostered</mark>"
434,"<mark> Some two and a half years later, that commitment has not been honoured</mark>"
435,"<mark> Companies such as Centrica, BP and Shell are making record profits, much of which goes to their already wellheeled shareholders, and yet my constituentsand those of Members on both sides of this Househave seen a 50% increase in the energy price cap and are likely to see an equivalent increase later this year</mark>"
436,"<mark> She is frightened that that will go, and makes the point that his 3</mark>"
437,"<mark>1% benefit increase for his disability is, de facto, a serious decrease in his income, as inflation is likely to hit 10% later this year</mark>"
438,<mark> They have seen only a 3</mark>
439,"<mark>1% increase in their pensions, when they know inflation will hit levels way above that</mark>"
440,"<mark> Even increasing the national minimum wage by 50p to £10, for which many on the Opposition Benches argue, would yield in the order of £900 a year</mark>"
441,<mark> The average income in my constituency is £250 a week less than is earned in wages in the Prime Ministers constituency</mark>
442,"<mark> That is a staggering difference £12,500 a year per person working in a fulltime occupation</mark>"
443,"<mark> We have a society that is now profoundly unequal, in which the billionaires are floating on a sea of riches while millions of people are living in poverty, including children and families in work</mark>"
444,"<mark> When inequality and the lack of social mobility are put together, what do we have We have a class structure, the old British disease ossified, unchanging and built on a system that enriches a few and leaves so many millions behind</mark>"
445,<mark> Paying people in my area the same as people in the Prime Ministers would require a fifth of £1 billion a year; getting halfway there would cost us a staggering £100 million a year</mark>
446,<mark> It would cost £200 million a year to pay people in my constituency what people earn down in the Prime Ministers</mark>
447,<mark> That is why we have already committed £9</mark>
448,<mark>1 billion to assist with energy costs alone</mark>
449,"<mark> We are giving back £150 to people in their council tax, cutting fuel duty, increasing the warm  home discount, creating a tax cut for 30 million workers by raising the national insurance threshold and delivering the biggest ever increase in the national living wage, worth an extra £1,000 a year to those working full time</mark>"
450,"<mark> But however great our compassion and ingenuity, we cannot simply spend our way out of this problem; we need to grow out of the problem by creating hundreds of thousands of new highwage, highskilled jobs across the country</mark>"
451,"<mark> This Government help people with the cost of heating, with the £9</mark>"
452,"<mark>1 billion that we are putting in, with the holiday activities and food programme and with the extra billions that we are putting in to support local councils</mark>"
453,"<mark> We have heard a lot of words being very rapidly delivered, but what we have not heard yet is an apology to the pensioners who are choosing between heating and eating, an apology to the children who have gone hungry throughout the school holidays and an apology to the hundreds of thousands of family members of covid victims who were lost during the pandemic</mark>"
454,"<mark>I am very grateful for that intervention, and I agree 100% with what the hon</mark>"
455,"<mark> If we go back to the 1970s, Nigg was a thriving industrial base, with thousands of jobs in that community supporting the oil industry</mark>"
456,<mark> I pay tribute to the speech that was given on her behalf</mark>
457,"<mark> We are the rat run of choice for every HGV, whenever there is congestion on the M1 or the M40</mark>"
458,"<mark> I do not know why that is so difficult, but I do know that by the end of the year, when inflation hits 10%, we will see even more people queuing at food banks, which is not a sight that any of us wish to see</mark>"
459,"<mark> Of course, that situation will also be exacerbated by the 30% drop in Ukraines exports, particularly of cooking oil and wheat, which will increase hardship at our tables</mark>"
460,"<mark> In the past few days, we have been bombarded with news of how household energy bills could hit £3,000 a year by October, how fire services across the country are reporting that they are dealing with blazes caused by people burning scraps of wood to keep warm, and, as was widely reported, how more than 2 million people are not eating every day because they just cannot afford it</mark>"
461,"<mark> That move was referred to by the CEO of Tesco on Radio 4 today, and it would save every household hundreds of pounds a year on their fuel bills and provide muchneeded additional support to the lowestincome households</mark>"
462,<mark> The extra support in Wales includes a £150 cost of living payment to all households in properties in council tax bands A to D and to all those in receipt of any council tax benefit</mark>
463,"<mark> There will be an extension to the Welsh winter fuel support scheme, which will provide people on low incomes and others with a nonrepayable £200 cash paymentnonrepayable being the key wordto help with their energy bills later this year, which they will receive on top of the £200 loan from the Government</mark>"
464,"<mark> Today, we have 11,000 fewer police officers, 7,000 fewer police community support officers and 8,000 fewer police staff in work than we did when Labour left office in 2010</mark>"
465,"<mark> With Wales facing a loss of more than £1 billion in unreplaced funding over the next three years, it begs the question as to whether the Prime Minister seriously thinks that the people of Wales have forgotten his Governments not a penny less promise to at least match, postBrexit, the size of the EU structural funds that Wales would have received</mark>"
466,"<mark> Waless rail networks are underfunded by billions of pounds, and that needs addressing today</mark>"
467,"<mark> We know that 14 million people are living in poverty, over 8 million of whom are in work</mark>"
468,<mark> We also know that 4</mark>
469,"<mark>5 million children living in poverty and, again, more than half of them are in working families</mark>"
470,<mark> The net effect of the autumn Budget and the spring statement is that there will be 1</mark>
471,"<mark>3 million more people living in absolute poverty, including 500,000 children</mark>"
472,<mark> She has developed estimates showing that £13</mark>
473,<mark>2 billion a year is being lost because of this differential in health</mark>
474,"<mark> There is just 3%, when we know that inflation is currently at 7% and predicted to go to 10% by the end of the year</mark>"
475,"<mark> That has to happen in the next three months, and the impact, according to the Governments own documents, is that nearly 1 million more people will be worse off</mark>"
476,"<mark> A million more These are Government choices, unfortunately</mark>"
477,"<mark> Friends and the people of Northern Ireland and in particular on behalf of the residents of Royal Hillsborough in my constituency We look forward to Her Majesty being able to travel to Northern Ireland again in the near future to stay with us in Hillsborough and meet again the very proud citizens of that village, who have recently been accorded royal status</mark>"
478,"<mark> I should make it clear that different principles apply to Front Benchers from the three largest parties, who are nominated to speak on behalf of their parties</mark>"
479,"<mark> For example, it is estimated that the additional cost of chilled food products is 18% as a result of the protocol, compared with the same products in Great Britain</mark>"
480,<mark> That is why I will be a loud voice for the brilliant Southend charity Prost8 and its groundbreaking work in this area</mark>
481,"<mark> We have heard a lot of words being very rapidly delivered, but what we have not heard yet is an apology to the pensioners who are choosing between heating and eating, an apology to the children who have gone hungry throughout the school holidays and an apology to the hundreds of thousands of family members of covid victims who were lost during the pandemic</mark>"
482,"<mark> Some of it is things that we have announced hundreds of millions of pounds for, getting on for two years ago now, that are bogged down in process, and often bogged down in Whitehall</mark>"
483,<mark> Two thirds of my generation bought their own home; today it is a quarter</mark>
484,"<mark> We are at least a million houses short, in a period in which the  population has increased by 7 million</mark>"
485,"<mark> We are about 100,000 houses a year short in what we are constructing, in addition to that million</mark>"
486,"<mark> In the last 20 years or so, the top 1% of the population have roughly trebled their income whereas the median has roughly flatlined, so there is a stronger argument for social mobility today than there was before</mark>"
487,"<mark> For me, that only highlights the question what on earth have they been doing for the last 12 years Why are we looking at negative growth Why are we looking at a projection of 10% inflation Why are we notand why were we not beforemore resilient and able to cope with the pandemic that hit us Why are my constituents wages stagnating Why are they not any better off The paucity of speakers remaining says an awful lot, too</mark>"
488,"<mark> However, we now know that apprenticeship starts have declined since 2010 by nearly 200,000, or 41%</mark>"
489,"<mark> Too few apprenticeships are available because the levy is not working, with too many small businesses not participating and fewer level 2 and 3 apprenticeships available</mark>"
490,"<mark> Conservatives are underfunding the socalled free childcare hours, which are mostly for three and fouryearolds, by more than £2 an hour, and parents are paying for the shortfall</mark>"
491,<mark> The silent misery of millions of women in particular who are giving and receiving care will not be helped</mark>
492,"<mark> Where is the security if people cannot afford to buy their own home and cannot qualify for social rented housing In my constituency, that is in massively short supply in any case, with hundredsthousandsof families living in massively overcrowded conditions</mark>"
493,"<mark> Every policy so far has fuelled the equity of those who already own their home, rather than giving a real legup to wannabe firsttime buyers in constituencies such as mine, whereI have said this repeatedly in this House, but I repeat it againa modern twobedroom flat will be on the market for about £750,000</mark>"
494,<mark> That is a huge increase9</mark>
495,<mark>1% over the past five years</mark>
496,"<mark> According to teachers in my constituency, children in years 7 and 8 are having to be taught how to do decent handwriting because they missed those crucial years at primary school</mark>"
497,"<mark> In some areas, pupils in years 7 and 8 are losing out because the qualified teachers are focused on the exam years</mark>"
498,<mark> That funding has fallen in real terms per pupil by 1</mark>
499,"<mark>2% for the most deprived fifth of schools, but has increased by nearly 3% for the least deprived fifth of schools</mark>"
500,"<mark> It is not possible to have sustainable food and farming if we are going to build all over our grade 1 and grade 2 agricultural land, which is what is happening in Thanet at this very moment</mark>"
501,"<mark> Some 70% of Englands land mass is farmed, so if we care about tackling climate change and the biodiversity crisis, the reality is that the greenest thing that any Government can do is keep Britains farmers farming</mark>"
502,<mark> All of the hundreds of farms that I represent are in that position</mark>
503,"<mark> This year, 13 of the farms that I representa tiny proportion, little more than 1%will be getting anything from the new sustainable farming incentive</mark>"
504,"<mark> The Governments botched transition to the new scheme is costing farmers thousands of pounds a year, with nothing to replace it</mark>"
505,"<mark> We will lose hundreds and hundreds of small to mediumsized family farms right across our country, many of them tenanted, costing us in biodiversity and food production</mark>"
506,<mark> The tourism economy of the Lake district and Cumbria is worth £3</mark>
507,"<mark>5 billion a year under normal circumstances, yet there is nothing to compensate the people who create the backdrop that makes so many people come to visit our beautiful part of the world</mark>"
508,"<mark> During the pandemic, 80% of house sales in my community have gone to the secondhome market, and at the same time there has been a 32% increase in the number of properties that have gone into the holidaylet market</mark>"
509,"<mark> In Devon, this has meant a 70% reduction in the longterm private rented sector</mark>"
510,"<mark> The proposal takes no account of the fact that, for instance, 90% of second homes bought in my constituency are bought for investment and then let out for 70 days a year</mark>"
511,"<mark> So I am angry, not just on behalf of my community but on behalf of communities across rural areas of our great country, that there is so little, if anything at all, for us in this Queens Speech</mark>"
512,"<mark> The Chancellor is getting £9 billion more in VAT receipts than the Budget prediction of £38 billion, yet the Government say that they cannot afford a VAT cut</mark>"
513,"<mark> That does not just mean a VAT cut; we want to increase and extend the warm home discount to help more than 7 million people with their heating bills, and we want to increase the winter fuel payment to help pensioners betrayed by the Conservatives when they broke their election promise on the pensions triple lock</mark>"
514,"<mark> Only last week, we learnt that BP and Shell are now raking in £1 billion in profit between them every single week from the same soaring gas and petrol prices that are making families suffer so much</mark>"
515,"<mark> They are selling them down the river with trade deals that allow lowwelfare foreign imports to undercut responsible British farmers, and cutting the payments on which they rely, which is costing some of them up to half their entire income</mark>"
516,"<mark> In the southwest alone, farmers will lose almost £1 billion by the end of 2027 as a result of these Conservative policies</mark>"
517,"<mark> And then there is the ticking timebomb of NHS dentistryor lack of itforcing people to shell out hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds for private work because they cannot get to see an NHS dentist</mark>"
518,"<mark> More than 1 million people are missing out on the care they need right now, and still the Government are doing nothing to help</mark>"
519,"<mark> According to one set of figuresand they still keep changingit came in at £90 billion below the Office for Budget Responsibility and Treasury forecast, because with more growth comes more activity, more incomes and more spending, so the Treasury can collect more VAT and income tax</mark>"
520,"<mark> The two main aims of economic policy should be a 2% inflation target, embedded as a Government target as well as a control mechanism on the Bank of England, and a complementary 2% growth targetnot that exacting in the context of 20thcentury experience in the United Kingdom, but fairly challenging in the context of the current centurys experience because of the disfiguring effect of the big banking crash and great recession in the middle of its first two decades</mark>"
521,"<mark> Anyone who wants to see what happens with the playbook should look at what is happening in Turkey at the moment, and at what has happened, on a grotesque scale, in Venezuela, where the generous state kept printing and kept borrowing and ended up destroying more than half its national income and much of the potential of the oil industry, which used to pay for everything because it was nationalised and incompetently run</mark>"
522,<mark> It makes green sense because the CO2 output created by burning our own gas is considerably less than that of the elaborate process of carrying it halfway round the world and having it compressed and decompressed so that it can travel as LNG</mark>
523,<mark> It is about half the CO2 generated</mark>
524,"<mark> First and foremost, on the need to address the cost of living crisis, the Government have brought in some measures to help to support families and businesses, but more targeted assistance is required to enable people to get through the coming year, which many are facing with fear and trepidation with the expectation of inflation at 10% and Ofgems increase in the energy cap looming in the autumn</mark>"
525,"<mark> A survey in the Lowestoft Journal showed that 41% of people are in debt, and Citizens Advice, local councils  and local charities are already working in overdrive to assist, advise and support people</mark>"
526,"<mark> Last week, the Learning and Work Institute recommended that smaller businesses should be able to deduct 230% of the cost of accredited training from their tax liability</mark>"
527,<mark> 1 item in my inbox</mark>
528,"<mark> It has called for £1,000 bill discounts for 10 million families before energy bills rocket by another £900 this autumn, and yet, once again, there is nothing of that from the Prime Minister and the Chancellor in this Queens Speech</mark>"
529,"<mark> He could have matched the Scottish child payment, which doubled in April and will increase to £25 per week per child by the end of this year</mark>"
530,<mark> He could have matched the increase in Scottishissued social security payments by 6%</mark>
531,<mark>7 billion from the revenues brought in from North sea oil</mark>
532,"<mark> All that revenue from Scotlands resources, and still this  UK Government refuse to match the Scottish Governments £500 million just transition fund to help to ease reliance on fossil fuels</mark>"
533,"<mark> Gentleman that yes, we will spell out exactly the plan for that £500 million transition fund</mark>"

541,"<mark> Gentleman agree that it is remarkable that, for a Government who say that they care about the cost of living crisis, there was absolutely nothing new in this Queens Speech around, for example, a mass home insulation programme Such a programme would be the cheapest, most effective and fastest way of getting our emissions down, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, and tackling climate emissions, and yet we have nothing new on that at all in this Queens Speech</mark>"

578,<mark> We have to get those homes built because we are letting down hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens</mark>

614,<mark>The Northern Ireland Finance Minister has said that the shared prosperity money for Northern Ireland is £90 million short of what was provided by the EU</mark>
615,"<mark>But is the Secretary of State aware that in the first round of levellingup funding, Wales applied for and received almost 50% more than was first allocated, and for Scotland the figure was 10%, yet Northern Ireland got 3% less Will he assure us today that the same will not happen with the shared prosperity fund, and that levelling up for Northern Ireland means more than just being hit by the same tax rises that are being inflicted on the rest of the UK by this Tory Government</mark>"
616,"<mark> The fund will inject around £127 million into Northern Ireland over the next three years to support communities, boost local business, and invest in people and skills</mark>"
617,"<mark> Lady looks back over the past couple of years, to the previous spending review and the current one, she will see that we have just put in the largest block grant budget for Northern Ireland since devolution began in 1998, and that is aside from the extra investment we are making through the community renewal fund and the new deal, with £400 million for a range of infrastructure projects</mark>"
618,"<mark> The EU regional development fund and the European social fund, on average, reaching about £1</mark>"
619,<mark>5 billion a year</mark>
620,<mark>The Secretary of State will know that there is £300 million in a bank account in Stormont that cannot be spent because the Democratic Unionist party walked out of the Executive</mark>
621,"<mark> That builds on the £2 billion from New Decade, New Approach and the £400 million new deal money, which will boost Northern Ireland</mark>"
622,<mark>3%</mark>
623,<mark> We know that 4</mark>
624,<mark>7 million adults and 2</mark>
625,"<mark>5 million children live in food poverty, 2</mark>"
626,"<mark>1 million food parcels were issued last year, and 1 million people will not eat at all today</mark>"
627,<mark> London School of Economics analysis shows that Brexit alone raised food prices by 6% in the past year or so</mark>
628,"<mark> The Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts Brexit losses to be more than £1,250 per person, and 178 times bigger than trade deal gains, which, combined, are worth less than 50p per person</mark>"
629,"<mark> Between 2008 and 2016, the proportion of household income spent on food by the poorest 20% of households was about 16%</mark>"
630,"<mark> It then dipped to under 15%, but we can expect that proportion to rise</mark>"
631,<mark> We have made available an additional £500 million to help households with increased pressure on household budgets</mark>
632,"<mark>Our food security, based on the amount of production we have in this country as a proportion of our consumption, has remained remarkably stable, at around 75%, for the past 22 years</mark>"
633,"<mark> She also helped secure £150,000 for a community hub in Thurnby and £150,000 for a pub in Frisby from our community ownership funds, and I look forward to drinking in them at some point</mark>"
634,"<mark> Of course, her local authorities have also benefited from funding from the UK shared prosperity fund Rutland, Melton and Leicestershire are receiving over £5 million of UK SPF funding, with Rutland getting over £1 million, Harborough over £2</mark>"
635,<mark>1 million and Melton just shy of £1</mark>
636,<mark>2 million</mark>
637,"<mark> On top of that, Leicestershire is receiving nearly £3 million in multiply funding</mark>"
638,<mark> The £4</mark>
639,"<mark>8 billion levellingup fund, which recently opened for its second round, could  be used to boost some of the fantastic rural food businesses that she mentioned, or to make the most of the incredible cultural discoveries that she also mentioned</mark>"
640,"<mark> She noted that Rutland and Melton were in tier 2; again, that is because the index for the levellingup fund recognises the challenges of rural and poorly connected areas in a way that previous Governments have not</mark>"
641,<mark> The £3</mark>
642,"<mark>6 billion towns fund is regenerating communities throughout the country, and there is more to come, with the £1</mark>"
643,"<mark>8 billion brownfield fund mainly still to be allocated, which will help drive regeneration and save valued green spaces</mark>"
644,<mark> We are investing £5 billion so that hardtoreach areas can get gigabit speeds</mark>
645,"<mark> More than 67% of UK premises can now access gigabitcapable broadband, an enormous leap forward from July 2019, when coverage was just 8%</mark>"
646,"<mark> The £1 billion that we are investing in the shared rural network will particularly help to improve mobile signal in rural areas such as Rutland and Melton, so that she can spend even more time when she is on the A47 lobbying Ministers with brutal effectiveness</mark>"
647,<mark> Our local government finance settlement for 202223 meets that ambition by providing an additional £3</mark>
648,"<mark>7 billion of funding to local authorities, including support for adult social care reform, which is critical for rural areas with older populations</mark>"
649,"<mark> Friends constituency, that funding translates to a cashterms increase in core spending power for Harborough council of 6% compared with last year; for Melton it is a 9</mark>"
650,<mark>3% increase and for Rutland a 7</mark>
651,<mark>4% increase</mark>
652,<mark> For Leicestershire County Council it translates to a 6</mark>
653,<mark>9% increase compared with the previous year</mark>
654,"<mark> If Leicestershire were funded the same as Surrey, it would get something like £104 million more, which I will address in more detail shortly</mark>"
655,"<mark> The national figure for this years funding settlement is £128 per person, but Leicestershire County Council gets only £85 per person</mark>"
656,"<mark>Rural prosperity has been stifled, and the rural powerhouse campaign estimates that closing the rural productivity gap would add £43 billion of gross value added to our economy</mark>"
657,"<mark> Rutland ranks in the bottom 10% of the entire country for social mobility, and I believe rurality plays a large role in that, alongside insufficient Government support</mark>"
658,"<mark> 1 on the Impower index as the highest performing council on adult social care in the country, but we have forecast a budget gap for 202324 onwards</mark>"
659,"<mark> We are required to raise a shocking 80% of our revenue through taxation, whereas the national average for councils is just 60%</mark>"
660,"<mark> That means that the council tax for a band D property in Rutland is £2,200 a year, and we are talking about a council in the worst 10% for social mobility in our country</mark>"
661,<mark> We receive £331 less Government funding per household than other councils and we have the highest council tax in the country</mark>
662,"<mark> As I mentioned, if LCC was funded at the same level as Surrey, it would have £104 million more to support people across Leicestershire</mark>"
663,<mark> It is going to transform the town centre of Melton and bring £160 million of investment into our amazing town</mark>
664,"<mark> The Government kindly provided £50,000 of funding to look at my proposal to reopen it</mark>"
665,"<mark> In 2021, Onward and the National Farmers Union highlighted that only 20% of people in rural areas can access broadband speeds above 24 Mbps</mark>"
666,"<mark> Rutland and Melton are currently tier 2 priority areas in the levellingup fund, so give us that chance to succeed and support us</mark>"
667,"<mark> Friend  share my concern and that of my constituents that the Labour woke warriors are quite happy to stick with the status quo, meaning that more people are going to leave safe mainland France, risking their lives and putting thousands of pounds in the hands of smuggling gangs, which will mean more death in the channel and illegal economic migrants continuing to enter the United Kingdom</mark>"
668,"<mark> The British people deserve to know how their taxes are being spent, not least because the failed Australian model ended up costing £1 million per refugee</mark>"
669,"<mark> The Prime Minister says it is tens of thousands; is that correct How many can they house in the detention centres What will the cost per single refugee be What will the £120 million be spent on Finally, given that her most senior civil servant refused to sign off on the plan, when will the Home Secretary publish a comprehensive cost forecast of her unworkable, extortionate and profoundly unBritish Rwanda offloading agreement</mark>"
670,"<mark>In 2021, fraud and computer misuse increased by 47%</mark>"
671,<mark>99% of total cybercrime went unpunished</mark>
672,"<mark> Just weeks ago, academics at the University of Oxford estimated that during covid alone, £37 billionor one third of the total NHS annual budget, and twice the annual budget for policingis likely to have been lost to fraud</mark>"
673,"<mark> Part of that is the spending review commitment that has just been made; there is also the new economic crime levy, which represents an additional £400 million over this spending review period</mark>"
674,<mark> We have supported the introduction of a new national policing lead and provided more than £27</mark>
675,<mark>5 million for 79 local projects to improve womens safety in public spaces</mark>
676,"<mark> It strengthens management of sex offenders, introduces more electronic tagging, and ends the automatic halfway release from prison for serious and violent sex offenders</mark>"
677,"<mark> On the wider point, the reality is that food prices and international commodity prices have always been linked very closely to the price of energy, and the sharp spike in gas prices is inevitably going to have an impact, but overall we are still selfsufficient for about 75% of the foods we consume</mark>"
678,<mark> The rebuilding of infrastructure will cost billions of dollars</mark>
679,"<mark> As a result of the £24 billion uplift in defence spending, we are in good shape, in good size and more lethal, more mobile and more agile than ever before</mark>"
680,"<mark> We will continue to keep our defence posture under review, but thanks to the £24 billion uplift, we are in good shape</mark>"
681,"<mark> Member recognise that the Government have invested some £220 million at RollsRoyce It is not just talk, as he asserts</mark>"
682,"<mark> Can the Minister confirm  that apparent £500 million figure It has also emerged that the Secretary of State for Defence has warned the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the UK risks falling short, as soon as 2025, of its NATO commitment to spending 2% of GDP on defence, due to the compound effect of inflation and supplying armaments to Ukraine</mark>"
683,"<mark> Member mentioned our commitment to the NATO standard of spending 2% on defence, and of course that is being challenged by inflation</mark>"
684,<mark> We invested that £1</mark>
685,"<mark>3 billion because of that, and we will keep it under review</mark>"
686,"<mark> She mentioned £187 million, I think, for victim support</mark>"
687,"<mark> Overall client numbers have doubled, and queries on energy have increased by 250%</mark>"
688,"<mark> The number of debt queries has increased by 200%, and council tax debt is now the biggest issue, with a 200% increase on last year</mark>"
689,"<mark> We eagerly await the details, given that the Government have allowed 6,000 local bank branches to close on their watch since 2015, leaving many geographically isolated communities without access to cash</mark>"
690,"<mark> For instance, the Chancellor could reduce council tax by a quarter, at a cost of £10 billion a year</mark>"
691,<mark> That would reduce the retail price index by 1%</mark>
692,<mark> He could halt skyrocketing energy bills with a 50% cut</mark>
693,"<mark> That would cost another £10 billion, but it would take another 1% off the RPI</mark>"
694,"<mark> A 1% RPI increase puts £5 billion on to those interest payments, but equally, 1% off the RPI saves £5 billion</mark>"
695,<mark> Her Majestys Treasury could finance the additional £10 billion with the windfall tax on the energy companies profits</mark>
696,<mark> Saving £10 billion for the financial markets and £10 billion from a windfall tax could fix many of the problems that we face immediately</mark>
697,"<mark> Well, there are not many Tories here, so maybe I can speak for another half an hour</mark>"
698,<mark> More than 2 million adults across the UK have gone without food for a whole day over the past month because they simply cannot afford to eat</mark>

700,"<mark> A record 6 million people are waiting for NHS treatment; they are waiting longer than ever before, often in serious pain and discomfort, limiting their ability to carry out their lives as normal</mark>"
701,"<mark> Instead of introducing measures to deal with rocketing food and energy costs, the Government are choosing to forge ahead with a tranche of halfbaked and recycled ideas from previous Queens Speeches that they have failed to implement and, worse still, with unnecessary ideological Bills that will do nothing to help the people of this country</mark>"
702,"<mark> We have sent more than 6,900 new antitank missiles, known as NLAWsnextgeneration light antitank weaponsa further consignment of Javelin antitank missiles, eight air defence systems, including Starstreak antiair missiles, 1,360 antistructure munitions and 4</mark>"
703,<mark>5 tonnes of plastic explosives</mark>

706,"<mark> The UK has pledged £220 million of humanitarian aid for Ukraine, which includes granting in kind to the Ukraine armed forces more than 64,000 items of medical equipment from the MODs own supplies</mark>"

718,"<mark> The House of Commons Library found that, thanks to this Government, £100 million a year less was spent on tackling drug and alcohol addiction in the three years to 2020, a decision that is right now fuelling crime</mark>"

771,"<mark> I am ready for this years challenges but I am also raring for our independence referendum, because when the people of Scotland recognise that the only way to stop tinkering around the edges of dreadful Tory policies and to stop having to spend millions of pounds on mitigating the effect of those policies, thus leaving the Scottish Government with a lot less money to do the things that we as a country want to do, and they reach the conclusion that the only way to have full control over the kind of country we are is to vote yes to independence, I predict that that is exactly what they will do</mark>"

808,"<mark> We would all love to see it happen, but is it possible to achieve, when the highest performing areas currently do not reach 90% It is hard to see how a Government who are presiding over half a million more children sinking into absolute poverty can possibly achieve that goal, given all that we know about the impact of poverty on achievement at school</mark>"

842,"<mark>We meet during a cost of living emergency, which is why I am so taken aback that too many Tory MPs in this debatethough there are far too few here nowinstead of calling for the action and support that millions of people across our country need, have resorted to Alf Garnett cosplay, ranting about socalled benefit cheats, ranting about asylum seekers and fixating on a single protester outside Parliament and how he annoys them</mark>"

847,"<mark> That is completely out of touch, despite the Alf Garnett theatrics, and it is completely contemptuous of the reality faced by millions of people in our society</mark>"
848,"<mark> At the same time, gas and oil giants are making £900 profit every second</mark>"
849,"<mark> Yesterdays Queens Speech should have been the moment to make our energy system work for people, not for profit, by including a windfall tax to raise billions to lower the bills of millions</mark>"
850,"<mark> Not only that, it should have introduced the price caps we have seen in France, which have allowed bills to rise by only 4% and not by the 54% we have seen here, and we should have seen action to bring the energy system back into public ownership so that it works for people and not for profit</mark>"
851,"<mark> But the Prime Minister and his Government are willing to accept millions of people being forced into fuel poverty because that, to them, is more acceptable than the alternative of reducing the profits of the oil and gas giants</mark>"

862,<mark> That the UK Government have reduced nutritionspecific international aid by 70% is certainly concerning</mark>

910,"<mark> I put on record my thanks to the Public and Commercial Services Unionthe trade union of Home Office staff, including Border Force staffand the charities Care4Calais, Channel Rescue and Freedom from Torture for taking on this legal challenge</mark>"
911,"<mark> In amendment 7, the Lords calls once again for asylum seekers to be granted the right to worknot granted the right to work but for their right to work to be recognised, because the right to work is a fundamental human right that cannot be taken away</mark>"
912,"<mark> Over the course of the Bills progress, I have had literally hundreds of messages, ultimately asking for the whole Bill to be withdrawn, but if not, then at least to try to humanise it wherever possible, as their lordships have tried to do this evening</mark>"
913,"<mark> They would also set out our existing legal obligations on the face of the Bill, such as our duties under the refugee convention and the European convention on human rights, especially the article 8 right to family life</mark>"
914,"<mark> Under this Home Secretary, the Home Office is processing 50% fewer cases than five years agothe result 37,000 asylum seekers languishing in expensive hotels, costing the taxpayer an eyewatering £4</mark>"
915,<mark>7 million per day</mark>
916,"<mark> The deterrent effect of a returns agreement would be so much stronger than the threat of being offloaded to Rwanda, because it would mean that every small boat refugee would be returned rather than just a tiny percentage, which is the most we can hope for from the Rwanda deal</mark>"
917,"<mark> Lords amendments 6D, 6E and 6F provide  that a person can be a tier 1 refugee if they have travelled briefly through countries on their way to the UK, as somebody from Kabul or Kyiv would have to, or if they have delayed presenting themselves to the authorities for a good reason</mark>"
918,"<mark> The Ukraine scheme today had a queue three hours long in Portcullis House of MPs staffers fighting for Ukrainians on behalf of their constituents, because the visas simply are not getting processed</mark>"
919,"<mark> I asked him how many refugees does he expect to send to Rwanda each year The Prime Minister says tens of thousands; is that correct What will the cost be per single refugee going to Rwanda What will the £120 million sweetener being paid by the UK to Rwanda actually be spent on How many asylum seekers can Rwandas detention centres house at any given time Finally, given that the top civil servant at the Home Office refused to sign off on the Rwanda plan, citing concerns over value for money, when will the Minister publish a full forecast of the costs</mark>"
920,"<mark>I beg to move, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 5D</mark>"
921,<mark> We certainly would not be spending £120 million on a press release</mark>
922,"<mark> Dumping this challenge on a developing country 4,000 miles away, with a questionable record on human rights, raises serious concerns about whether this legislation complies with the UN refugee convention</mark>"
923,<mark> That is why we will back Lords amendment 5D</mark>
924,"<mark> The culture recovery fund provided more than £60 million for 580 churches and cathedrals, and a partnership with the Wolfson Foundation, the Pilgrim Trust and the National Churches Trust has provided grants to pay for the care of historic interiors and collections</mark>"

930,"<mark>The Minister knows well my continued opposition to HS2 so this is not unusual, but I have some specific points to make about the phase 2 Bill</mark>"
931,<mark> She has discussed the merits of the objections to phase 2b of HS2 with my constituents who are injuriously affected</mark>
932,"<mark> Those facilities, together with another proposed arrangement at the Crewe rolling stock depot, will, I believe, waste an estimated £475 million of taxpayers money</mark>"
933,"<mark> With a further £171 million of savings to be made by the use of a Transport and Works Act order on phase 2, the Minister will know that I and parliamentary colleagues are calling for less than half the total of the £650 million saved to be directed towards the reopening of eight miles of the former North Staffordshire railway</mark>"
934,<mark> I therefore call on the Minister to amend the phase 2 Bill and remove the proposals for Ashley when it returns to the House</mark>
935,"<mark> I greatly look forward to further discussions taking place between my constituents, the Ministers officials and appointed rail experts on how we can make required improvements to the phase 2a proposals as soon as possible</mark>"
936,"<mark> Labour welcomes the muchneeded extension of High Speed 2, and has long supported HS2 being built in full, as that will help to address the severe capacity constraints on our rail network, and improve connections between cities in the midlands and the north</mark>"
937,<mark> We cannot accept a situation where just one UKbased firm was shortlisted for £2</mark>
938,<mark>5 billionworth of contracts for track and tunnel systems for HS2</mark>
939,"<mark> Friend is a doughty campaigner for spending 3% and I consider him my longrange artillery when it comes to the lobbying in the long term, whatever we see as a result of the situation in Ukraine</mark>"
940,"<mark> I will just say that, as he will know, 2,400 UK registered businesses have now won work on the HS2 programme, with over 22,000 people employed</mark>"
941,"<mark> Before Easter, in February and March 2022, more than 85% of queue measurements were under 45 minutes for nonEU passengers</mark>"
942,"<mark> Secondly, the cost of HS2 had continued to rise at an eyewatering rate, and that was before we saw the current huge rates of inflation, which will put it up further</mark>"
943,"<mark> The proposals that I will put to him are not insurmountable, especially when we consider the scale of the High Speed 2 project from Crewe to Manchester and the public expenditure that that will involve</mark>"
944,"<mark> I recently wrote to him regarding the experience that my constituents, the Collins family, had at Newcastle airport when returning from holiday at a quarter to 11 at night a week or two ago</mark>"
945,<mark>I rise to present a petition on behalf of my constituents who are members of the Save our Derwent Walk campaign group</mark>
946,<mark>I rise to present a petition on behalf of the residents of High Peak calling for stepfree access at Chinley station</mark>

951,"<mark> It is worth also reflecting on the other impact, which is that hundreds of police officers are pulled away from policing neighbourhoods across the UK, because forces provide each other with mutual aid</mark>"
952,<mark> That is why we consistently see 30% or 40% of our energy on many days in 2022 provided by renewables rather than by fossil fuels</mark>
953,"<mark> We have made significant progress in the past 30 years, under Governments of all colours emissions down 40%, the economy up by nearly 80%, renewables now making up nearly 40% of our electricity generation in 2021, up from 7%, and by far the most advanced decarbonisation of any western country</mark>"
954,<mark> Last years United Nations Environment Programme production gap report concluded that in order to limit warming to 1</mark>
955,"<mark>5C, the world will need to decrease fossil fuel production by at least 6% per year between 2020 and 2030</mark>"
956,"<mark>5C, our analysis shows that all producer countries must peak their production immediately and begin an uninterrupted decline</mark>"
957,"<mark> Tyndall analysis finds that the UK must reduce our oil and gas production by 50% in six years, which equates to an 8</mark>"
958,"<mark>3% reduction year on year, and must cease it completely by 2034and that is just for a 50% chance of staying below 1</mark>"
959,<mark>5C once equity is factored in</mark>
960,<mark>5C threshold</mark>
961,<mark>5 C global temperature goal</mark>
962,"<mark> While companies such as BP and Shell are raking in eyewatering profits, millions of households are pushed into poverty</mark>"
963,<mark> Yet only a tiny proportion of the oil and gas industrys  total capital expenditure is going into renewablesjust 1% in 2020 and still only in single figures today</mark>
964,<mark>5 billion to UK energy bills over the past decade</mark>
965,"<mark> I do not support any strategy that defines winning at this critical juncture in human history in terms that literally sacrifice the future of humanity, or indeed policies like a climate checkpoint that would somehow greenlight the pumping of new North sea oil and gas when there is no global scenario in which that is compatible with keeping 1</mark>"
966,"<mark>5 alive and climate justicea critical threshold which, let us remember again, means that every producer country must peak their production immediately and begin an uninterrupted decline</mark>"
967,<mark>5</mark>
968,"<mark> To put it another way, if we turn on more taps, as the Governments energy security strategy suggests, it is inevitable that we will end up watching the flood waters rise on the future and be forced to take drastic actioninevitable because pumping more fossil fuels from new wells undermines our fundamental ability to keep the  global temperature increase to 1</mark>"
969,<mark>5</mark>
970,<mark>5</mark>
971,<mark> The IPCCs latest report warns that emissions from existing and currently planned fossil fuel infrastructure are higher than the pathways for 1</mark>

973,"<mark> It is backed by more than 2,700 global scientists, Nobel peace prize winners and climate leaders</mark>"
974,"<mark> The CCC recognises that, even with a significant role for carbon capture and storage, total UK gas consumption must fall by 50% by 2035 and by 75% by 2050</mark>"
975,"<mark> What is more, 70% of what is left in the North sea basin is oil, not gasand it is not even the type of oil that we use in UK refineries anyway</mark>"
976,"<mark> No Government in their right mind would consider such a move, and nor would they continue to support the fossil fuel industry through tax breaks and financial support for exploration and for research and development, yet that is happening, to the tune of £12 billion a year</mark>"
977,"<mark> I know the Treasury does  not consider a penny of that to be a subsidy, but New Economics Foundation analysis found that around £10 billionworth is indeed covered by the subsidy definition used by, for example, the International Monetary Fund</mark>"
978,<mark> Shell alone received a £92 million tax rebate from the UK in 2021the largest total from any country in which it operates</mark>
979,"<mark> That would allow it to run until 2039, extracting a further 40 million tonnes of coal and emitting up to an estimated 100 million tonnes of CO2</mark>"
980,"<mark> We are told that the proposed Cumbria mine is needed to provide coking coal for the steel industry until 2049, yet less than 10% of that coal is expected to be used by the UK steel industry; 85% of it is planned for export to Europe</mark>"
981,"<mark> The CCC is clear that coking coal used in steelmaking could be displaced completely by 2035, only halfway through the mines proposed lifetime</mark>"
982,"<mark> The Tyndall centre says that, for developed nations such as the UK, coal production needs to fall by 50% within five years and be effectively eliminated by 2030nine full years before Aberpergwm would cease production and 19 years ahead of when the Cumbria coal mine is projected to close</mark>"
983,"<mark>5, no new unabated coal plants, no new coal mines and no new mine extensions can be approved for development after 2021</mark>"

987,<mark>5 million to fund various capital projects</mark>
988,"<mark>5 million to finance various projects, at the same time exhausting the councils general reserve fund</mark>"
989,<mark> The plan envisages that £49</mark>
990,<mark>7 million be borrowed to finance climate change and green energy investment projects</mark>
991,<mark> The largest of these projects is to buy five solar farm sites for a total of £46</mark>
992,<mark>5 million</mark>
993,"<mark> In addition, there are plans to borrow £25 million for investment in a variety of projects described as investments for economic development and asset usage, although further details on these schemes are currently not available</mark>"
994,"<mark>8 million housing loan to contribute to Cottsway Housing, which produces income below target</mark>"
995,"<mark> I understand that councillors were originally advised that about half the borrowing was for social housing, only to later discover from the plans that only £1</mark>"
996,<mark>8 million had been allocated</mark>
997,"<mark> However, according to the plans, it appears that some £50 million is scheduled to be spent next year, as they are showing an income for the following year</mark>"
998,"<mark> For example, Nottingham City Council ultimately lost £30 million of public money in 2015 after it set up and invested in Robin Hood Energya localised green energy company that ran into financial difficulties and could not pay its bills</mark>"
999,"<mark> In 2020, Croydon Council effectively declared itself bankrupt with a £73 million shortfall</mark>"
1000,<mark> It borrowed £545 million during a threeyear period to invest in commercial and housing properties</mark>
1001,<mark> The council invested £30 million in the Croydon Park hotel in 201819</mark>
1002,"<mark> A central Government taskforce was sent to oversee an audit in 2020, following these risky property investments and the council ignoring repeated warnings on its dire financial situation, and last year the council had to have a £120 million bailout from the Government</mark>"
1003,<mark> Friend the Member for Eastleigh Paul Holmes raised during Prime Ministers questions the shocking fact that by 2025 Liberal Democrat Eastleigh Borough Council will have a debt of £650 million following investment in property projects</mark>
1004,<mark> Cotswold District Council hopes to borrow the money from the Public Works Loan Board at 3</mark>
1005,"<mark>3%, making a profit on the loan by obtaining a return of 7</mark>"
1006,<mark>5% from the investment</mark>
1007,"<mark> As an illustration, the proposed loan by Cotswold District Council of £76</mark>"
1008,"<mark>5 million, repayable over 25 years, would require annual payments of around £3 million per annum</mark>"
1009,<mark>2 million last year</mark>
1010,<mark> From that £11</mark>
1011,"<mark>2 million, which needs to pay for all services if there is to be a balanced budget without a deficit, it would need to deduct £3 million for the annual loan repayment</mark>"
1012,"<mark> In the financial year 202122, the council forecast a budget of £12</mark>"
1013,<mark>55 million; £5</mark>
1014,"<mark>5 million is from council tax, £3</mark>"
1015,"<mark>278 million is from business taxes, and the balance of around £4 million is from a variety of Government grants, which are not necessarily recurring</mark>"
1016,<mark> Will the Minister confirm that the size of this loan£76</mark>
1017,<mark>6% increase in the tax bill for residents</mark>
1018,<mark> That is above the official cap in England of 2</mark>
1019,"<mark>99%the maximum allowed without a referendum of local council tax payers, and a cap that some 286 councils across England and Wales are exceeding</mark>"
1020,"<mark>5, there is evidence that, faced with the cost of living, people are asking the Government to help with the squeeze on bills by slowing down the increases in green levies</mark>"
1021,"<mark> In fact, in recent years, central Governmentthe Ministers Departmenthave given it significantly more money, as is laid out in the local government settlement, which includes £16</mark>"
1022,<mark>3 billion in settlement funding for local councils in England this financial year</mark>
1023,"<mark> With other grants and an estimate of council tax included, the core spending of councils across England will rise to £54</mark>"
1024,"<mark>1 billion, which is an increase of 4</mark>"
1025,<mark>6% on the previous year</mark>
1026,"<mark>5 million, as stated in the plan circulated to its capital programme investment board and cabinet, clearly demonstrate financial incompetence amounting to a recklessness that has the potential to bankrupt the council</mark>"
1027,"<mark> Plastic is a good product when used sensibly and when it can be recycled, and we often now see 100% recycled plastic</mark>"
1028,"<mark>The Minister will recall that earlier this year we launched Connected by Water, an innovative flood strategy for South Yorkshire that will protect thousands of homes and businesses</mark>"
1029,<mark>The Government are investing a record £5</mark>
1030,<mark>2 billion in a sixyear flood defence investment programme running from 2021 to 2127</mark>
1031,"<mark> This will be invested in about 2,000 new projects and schemes to better protect 336,000 properties</mark>"
1032,"<mark> In terms of the effect on the economy, it will save about £32 billion, which is really significant</mark>"
1033,<mark> I am pleased to report to the House that the construction on the £16 million restoration of the reservoir is due to start next month</mark>
1034,"<mark> Andy Matthews, who farms in Aberbrn, tells me that fertiliser was once £270 a tonne and is now £900 a tonne, which is a real risk for our food production capabilities</mark>"
1035,<mark> We are doing that by investing £38 million through the farming innovation programme</mark>
1036,<mark> We have launched an £8 million competition for large RD partnerships</mark>
1037,"<mark>Following their field trip to the River Wear last month, year 5 and 6 pupils at St Thomas More School in Belmont were saddened by the levels of pollution in the river, especially the amount of plastic, so they have asked me to come here today to keep everyone on the right track</mark>"
1038,"<mark> Indeed, our new proposed target to reduce the amount of pollution in rivers such as the Wear in old abandoned mining areas by 50% by 2030 will make a genuine difference, as will our raft of other measures to tackle storm sewage overflows</mark>"
1039,"<mark> 80A and Order, 25 April; to be considered tomorrow, and to be printed Bill 1 with explanatory notes Bill 1EN</mark>"
1040,"<mark> From our portfolio of development land, we aim to deliver 29,000 new homes, more than 30% of which will be classed as affordable</mark>"
1041,"<mark> For example, about 90% of those who have now been granted visas under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have done this via the biometric bypass they have not had to attend a VAC</mark>"
1042,"<mark> The £10,500 funding per person is partly there to help support the required ongoing safeguarding work, particularly where there are children or vulnerable women</mark>"
1043,"<mark> As I say, nearly 90,000 visas have been granted and we are seeing thousands more granted every day</mark>"
1044,"<mark> We have provided £30 million to Poland to help with providing temporary shelter, education and other basic services</mark>"
1045,"<mark> We are granting thousands more every day, and we look forward to seeing more people being able to come and take up the offers of sanctuary that people are making</mark>"
1046,"<mark> Can the Minister understand the frustration that I feel on behalf of that family, whose visas have been approved but who do not have the letters to travel Why is it that the Republic of Ireland does not ask people to submit themselves to checks that cause such delays</mark>"
1047,"<mark> I point out that our £120 million investment will help the Rwandans to surmount further barriers to growth and create jobs and opportunities, both for the people of Rwanda and for any asylum seekers who want to settle there</mark>"
1048,<mark> Childhood cancer accounts for less than 1% of all cancers in the UK</mark>
1049,"<mark> It is easy to talk about in those terms1% is nothingbut that 1% is 1,800 new cases diagnosed every year in children aged between 0 and 14 1,800 sons and daughters who go through devastating and punishing treatments, and 1,800 families with constant anxiety about whether their son or daughter will become part of those statistics</mark>"
1050,"<mark> That is £112,000 in total, and I am proud to report that the local community in Flint has raised £263,000 and counting</mark>"
1051,"<mark>Is that because there is not enough research I was surprised to learn that only 4% of funds raised for cancer research and treatment are directed towards childhood cancer and that children, unfortunately, are receiving treatment for adult bodies</mark>"
1052,"<mark> After she died they set up Georgias Fund, and have so far raised more than £200,000 for the charities Neuroblastoma UK and Children with Cancer UK</mark>"
1053,<mark> Childhood cancer accounts for less than 1% of all cancers in the UK</mark>
1054,"<mark> It is easy to talk about in those terms1% is nothingbut that 1% is 1,800 new cases diagnosed every year in children aged between 0 and 14 1,800 sons and daughters who go through devastating and punishing treatments, and 1,800 families with constant anxiety about whether their son or daughter will become part of those statistics</mark>"
1055,<mark> They deserve so much more than 3% government funding</mark>
1056,"<mark> I point out that our £120 million investment will help the Rwandans to surmount further barriers to growth and create jobs and opportunities, both for the people of Rwanda and for any asylum seekers who want to settle there</mark>"
1057,<mark> She was given a 5050 chance of survival over five years</mark>
1058,"<mark> At the age of four, Alice saw her odds of survival drop to just 8%</mark>"
1059,<mark> She is working hard on behalf of a range of families to further this debate</mark>
1060,"<mark> As we have heard, every year 1,800 children get a cancer diagnosis, and the biggest childhood cancer, leukaemia, accounts for about 30%</mark>"
1061,"<mark> Just over 30% of children survived leukaemia in the 1970s, but things improved fast; in the 1990s, my cousin, Suzanne Adamson, had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia when she was 10 but she has gone on to have a wonderful life, with a second child on the way</mark>"
1062,<mark> So there are some good outcomes and the leukaemia survival rates in the 1990s were at 80%</mark>
1063,"<mark> Cancer survival rates overall are now at 84%, but there is still room for improvement, as is shown by the death of Sophie</mark>"
1064,"<mark> At present, there is still a 0% chance of fighting that cancer and being able to survive</mark>"
1065,"<mark> He alone has raised thousands upon thousands of pounds for childrens charities, so that other parents do not have to suffer quite as much as the Pitcher family did</mark>"
1066,"<mark> I point out that our £120 million investment will help the Rwandans to surmount further barriers to growth and create jobs and opportunities, both for the people of Rwanda and for any asylum seekers who want to settle there</mark>"
1067,"<mark> But that is the physical side of the illness; what of the psychological issues that children who have had cancer treatment will almost certainly face About threeandahalf years ago, I had a debate in this Chamber on this very subject, highlighting what I thought were the problems</mark>"
1068,<mark> Our Rayhan underwent 6 weeks of radiotherapy at the highest dose permitted for a child his age</mark>
1069,"<mark> She had six GP visits, while her family became increasingly concerned, before a GP referred her for the hospital tests that revealed that she had a 9 cm tumour in her chest</mark>"
1070,<mark> One parent often has to give up work and the average estimated additional costs associated with supporting cancer treatment are £600 a month</mark>
1071,"<mark> Her motto was, Live Kindly, Live Loudly, and her family are seeking to keep Rubys memory alive by raising £500,000roughly what the NHS spent on treating Rubys cancerfor the Childrens Cancer and Leukaemia Group</mark>"
1072,"<mark> If we take glioblastoma, the fiveyear survival rate for children is only 20%</mark>"
1073,"<mark> It surveyed young people, parents and healthcare professionals, with 56% suggesting that better training for GPs on cancer in children and young people would  make the biggest single improvement</mark>"
1074,<mark> A recent trial for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia showed that young peoples survival rates improved by 18% through involvement in this clinical trial</mark>
1075,"<mark> What can be done to ensure that those who can and wish to be part of those trials can be part of them There is also no data publicly available to show progress towards the commitment of the 50% by 2025, and again I look to the Minister for help on that</mark>"
1076,"<mark> Worryingly, there are also reports that referrals to principal treatment centres are only occurring in about half of all cases, despite that being contrary to NICE guidance</mark>"
1077,"<mark> More than 5,000 children and young people have survived a diagnosis of cancer in the past two decadesa momentous and encouraging increase on previous statistics</mark>"
1078,"<mark> Outside infancy, cancer remains the most common cause of death in children and the most common diseaserelated cause of death in teenagers, yet less than 4% of all cancer research funding is spent on cancer that primarily affects children</mark>"
1079,"<mark> Lady for giving way, especially as she is giving such a heartfelt, passionate speech on behalf of her constituents</mark>"
1080,<mark> While 80% of children survive childhood cancer as a wholestill far too low80% of children with brain tumours die within five years of diagnosis</mark>
1081,"<mark> It is the biggest cancer killer of those under the age of 40, yet brain tumours receive less than 1% of the national spend on cancer research</mark>"
1082,"<mark>I think the names that we have read out this afternoon show that, while cancer in children only accounts for 1% of cancer cases, if you are in that 1%, it does not feel very rare at all</mark>"
1083,"<mark> I know from my experience as a nurse that we always serve food at 7, 12 and 6, and if someone is hungry in between, it is often very difficult to get any food at all</mark>"
1084,"<mark> The Government have already committed to improving cancer outcomes, and the 10year plan is absolutely an opportunity to make changes for the hundreds of families who are affected and desperately need our help</mark>"
1085,"<mark> From her bed she painted ceramics, which were sold to raise £6,000 to buy new toys for her ward</mark>"
1086,"<mark> So, on Sophies behalf, I ask the Minister to look at the provision of play specialists</mark>"
1087,"<mark> In this age group, there are around 1,800 new cancer cases every year</mark>"
1088,"<mark> Over 53% of childhood cancers are picked up through AE rather than through primary care, compared to 22% of adult cancers</mark>"
1089,"<mark> By the age of 50, they all100% of themhave lifealtering health issues, from fertility issues to severe neurodisability</mark>"

1164,"<mark> Could I request that the Minister takes away what she has heard from both sides of the Chamber today and comes back to the House as soon as possible in the next few days with a statement about how the UK is stepping up its leadership on the humanitarian crisis and about what it will do to expedite the evacuation and resettlement of atrisk Afghans who are relatives of our constituentsI have 400 cases outstandingto make sure there is a strong, clear message about how they could be evacuated for their safety They are still at risk and they are now falling prey to the worsening humanitarian situation</mark>"

1166,"<mark> In September the UN estimated that only 5% of Afghans had enough food to eat each day, so the UK Government cannot say that this famine has caught them by surprise</mark>"
1167,"<mark> With 1 million children at risk of severe malnourishment and 23 million people threatened with starvation, less than 25% of UK aid money pledged to Afghanistan in 2021 had been disbursed by the beginning of December, which is shocking</mark>"

1169,<mark> That is why we have already disbursed more than £145 million of humanitarian support</mark>
1170,"<mark> We have already disbursed over £145 million, which is going into lifesaving humanitarian support</mark>"

1177,"<mark> Friend the Member for Louth and Horncastle Victoria Atkins made clear last week, we have helped a further 1,500 to enter the UK, including female judges, human rights defenders and LGBT Afghans</mark>"
1178,"<mark> We will make more announcements in response to the UN appeal in the coming weeks, but I restate what I said in my statement about the importance of the World Bank giving options to unlock the $1</mark>"

1180,"<mark> We have played an active role in seeking to build a shared new international approach since the Taliban takeover, working with the UN Security Council, the G20 and the G7 and engaging with other countries in the region</mark>"
1181,"<mark> The Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and many other Ministers discussed Afghanistan with world leaders in the margins of COP26</mark>"
1182,"<mark> My colleague the Minister for south and central Asia, Lord Ahmad, is in regular contact with other neighbouring countries, and £30 million was allocated to help other countries in the region respond to the impact of the crisis on themselves</mark>"
1183,"<mark> We have announced an aim to settle 5,000 people in the first year of the ACRS</mark>"
1184,"<mark> It has to go through that scheme, which is one of the most generous in the world, with 5,000 people this year, but it cannot be every single person</mark>"
1185,"<mark>At the start of the withdrawal, I had 656 constituents with families trapped in Afghanistan</mark>"
1186,"<mark>First, I congratulate everyone in Sheffieldincluding GPs, the hospitals and the city councilwho worked brilliantly together to deliver thousands of vaccines in the runup to Christmas</mark>"
1187,"<mark> I think it has just about been sorted out, but I have received an email today from my constituent Jeanette, who says that although everyone in her situation should have received a letter offering the availability of new treatments, she got a letter but her husband did not; that although everyone should have been sent a PCR test in the post, she did not get one; and that although she was told to ring 119, when she did so she could not find the option to complain that she had not received a PCR test</mark>"
1188,"<mark> We should remember that the foundations were put in place when, at the height of the first wave, the then Health Secretary bought 400 million doses of vaccine that we did not even know would work</mark>"
1189,"<mark> When will we see a workforce plan that takes account of the new responsibilities for vaccination that the NHS will have When will the budget for Health Education England be agreed, because two and a half months before the next financial year we still do not know what it is Will the workforce plan have independent forecasts so that we can make sure we are training enough doctors and nurses for the future</mark>"
1190,"<mark> Analysis from her own Department, signed off by her, thinks that 73,000 NHS staff and 38,000 domiciliary care workers will leave</mark>"

1192,"<mark> Having turned 60 yesterday, I feel I ought to ask a question about the elderly</mark>"
1193,"<mark> Member for Forest of Dean Mr Harper pointed out, the immunity that comes from the booster runs out somewhat after 10 weeks</mark>"
1194,"<mark> Rather than sacking compulsorily what may be over 100,000 health and social care workers, surely before the deadline is upon us we should reconsider this policy</mark>"
1195,"<mark>It is great news that the Minister reports that 93% of NHS staff have received the vaccinethat is fantasticand I commend every effort made to encourage NHS staff and all those involved in the delivery of care to receive the vaccine, but what will the Government do if, in a few weeks, a critically high number of people in the NHS have still not had the vaccine Will they all face being sacked or moved in April How would that protect the NHS</mark>"
1196,"<mark> Will the Minister explain what risk assessment has been done of how, if unvaccinated staffas many as 88,000leave the NHS, treatment will be made available and how my constituents will be able to access daytoday healthcare and treatment</mark>"
1197,"<mark> The care sector has lost 54,000 people who refused to take the vaccine, with the result that hospital beds are blocked, care packages are not being given and care homes are under pressure</mark>"
1198,"<mark> The social care sector is an indication that we cannot force people to take the vaccine, and the Ministers own assessment is that up to 88,000 staff could resist taking it</mark>"
1199,"<mark> In the past week, 40,000 people in the NHS have been off work because they had to isolate, and we have seen the chaos that has caused</mark>"
1200,"<mark> How does she intend to deal with the chaos of 88,000 staff not being available because of the vaccine mandate</mark>"
1201,<mark> Women now account for more than half of all apprenticeship starts across the country and our apprenticeships diversity champions network is working with employers across the country to make sure we see the improvement we need</mark>
1202,"<mark> They are crying out for further clarity, and recent reports highlight that more than 300,000 housebound people are yet to receive their booster</mark>"
1203,"<mark> With reports of the UK discarding hundreds of thousands of vaccines over the past few months, can she reassure the House that assisting with vaccinating the world remains a priority for her Department and this Government</mark>"
1204,"<mark> Some 80% of eligible adults in England have now had the booster, including 87% of people over 50</mark>"
1205,"<mark> In addition, more than 1</mark>"
1206,"<mark>4 million young people aged 12 to 15 have already had their first dose since the vaccine was rolled out to that age group in September, with thousands still getting jabbed every day</mark>"
1207,"<mark> As of 10 January, eligible children aged 12 to 15 are being offered a second dose in their school</mark>"
1208,"<mark> The vaccine has already been given to millions of 12 to 15yearolds in a number of countries, including 8 million in the United States</mark>"
1209,<mark> That is why all eligible 12 to 15yearolds are able to book their second jab</mark>
1210,"<mark> I am delighted that about 80% of people over 18 have now been boosted, which is a fantastic achievement</mark>"
1211,<mark> Over 90% of the population aged 12 or over have had their first dose and 83% have taken up the offer of a second</mark>
1212,<mark> Gentleman mentioned a case where somebody had to travel 50 miles</mark>
1213,"<mark> I am delighted to announce that, as of the end of last year, we donated 30 million doses, partly through COVAX and partly through bilateral agreements, which is a great achievement, and we have a commitment in place for 100 million doses by the end of June this year</mark>"
1214,"<mark> Member for Denton and Reddish Andrew Gwynne, that to date we have donated 30 million doses to COVAX and bilaterally</mark>"
1215,<mark>  We will continue to fulfil our commitment to donate 100 million jabs globally by the end of June this year</mark>
1216,"<mark> If she  has received the letter but no PCR test, she should contact 119Test and Trace</mark>"
1217,"<mark> Friend said, to date over 93% of NHS staff have had their first jab</mark>"
1218,"<mark> Those who are unvaccinated are eight times more likely to be hospitalised, and more than 60% of people in intensive care units are unvaccinated</mark>"
1219,"<mark> NHS England is looking into it, to work out the best way to roll out the vaccine to that particularly vulnerable group of five to 11yearolds</mark>"
1220,"<mark>I refer back to the fact that the MHRA confirmed that the Pfizer vaccine is safe and effective in 12 to 17yearolds, and that followed the rigorous review of the safety, quality and effectiveness of the vaccines in this age group</mark>"
1221,"<mark> We lead the way on first and second doses administered, and we rank second worldwide for the most successful booster rollout programme, with over 80% of our adult population given their third vaccine</mark>"
1222,"<mark> Friend for her efforts to save us from vaccineonly passports, leaving the option for testing on the table, given what we know about the impact of vaccination on transmission and that fact that with compulsory vaccination the Governments central assumption is the loss of more than 100,000 healthcare workers</mark>"
1223,"<mark>When the facts change, we are entitled to change our minds, and since we passed the regulated activity regulations in December we have had further evidence to suggest that the transmissibility of covid declines after 10 or 12 weeks, as has been mentioned</mark>"
1224,"<mark> Rather than forcing NHS staff to have their first vaccine by 3 February, which will present a massive risk to the NHSthe Governments own assessment is that between 64,000 and 115,000 NHS and healthcare staff will be sackedwill the Government go back and review the issue, and ask the JCVI what the best strategy is for managing the pandemic from this point forward</mark>"
1225,<mark> The Minister outlined that 90% of people have had their first dose and over 80% their second</mark>
1226,"<mark> We have worked with faith leaders and other trusted local  voices to overcome vaccine hesitancy and provided more than £23 million in funding to support the community champion scheme, which we have just extended to support the booster campaign</mark>"
1227,"<mark> She will know that in her own constituency of Ealing Central and Acton we have spent £485,000 on the community champions scheme</mark>"
1228,<mark> She may be in her late teens or early 20s</mark>
1229,"<mark> Finally, what is left in front of us is a girl no older than 13 or 14</mark>"
1230,"<mark> The Women and Equalities Committee inquiry into body image found that concerns about the way we look start younger, last longer and affect more people than ever before, with 61% of adults and 66% of children feeling negative or very negative about their body image</mark>"
1231,"<mark> NHS England data released over the summer showed that there were 2,682 admissions of children under the age of 17 with a primary diagnosis of eating disorders between April 2020 and March 2021an increase of 34% on the previous year</mark>"
1232,"<mark> I have seen it in my own practice as a GP before being in this House, and I fear the numbers will only increase from the 1</mark>"
1233,"<mark>25 million people who have suffered with eating disorders and the 1 million people in the UK using steroids, many in pursuit of achieving an image that is simply unattainable no matter what they do</mark>"
1234,<mark>The World Health Organisation predicts that 1 million Afghan children under five will die of starvation this winter alone; another 2</mark>
1235,<mark>2 million will suffer acute malnutrition</mark>
1236,"<mark> Fears of misuse of donor funds and of validating the Taliban remain valid, but given the urgency of tackling the crisis, does the Minister agree that the UK Government must do more If this is truly not a time for party politics, will she, as my colleagues requested, say yes to the international conference of 68 nations that Gordon Brown has suggested</mark>"
1237,"<mark>Behind the boasts of jabs in arms that for a while were distracting from the death figures, until we hit 150,000, are the Government not as worried as I am that the Office for National Statistics is finding vaccine hesitancy among the black British population more than five times higher than among the white population Among the over50s, just 44% of Caribbeans and 42% of Pakistanis have been boosted, as opposed to 77% of white British</mark>"
1238,"<mark> They have been enormously generous, especially in response to the appeal just before Christmas, which was, of course, match funded with up to £10 million of additional funding from the UK Government</mark>"
1239,<mark> The United Nations revealed yesterday that it needs £5 billion in aid for Afghanistan to avert a humanitarian catastrophe</mark>
1240,"<mark> I should like to inform the House that already over 93% of the NHS workforce have had their first jab, which is incredible</mark>"
1241,"<mark> The fact that more than 90% of people have already had their first dose is a huge success, but the last few are the hardest to reach</mark>"
1242,"<mark> It is affecting well over half the population, with 23 million people facing acute food insecurity</mark>"
1243,<mark> The UN has this week requested nearly $4</mark>
1244,"<mark>5 billion for 2022the largest humanitarian appeal on record, reflecting the magnitude of the humanitarian challenge ahead</mark>"
1245,"<mark> In August, the Prime Minister announced that the UK would double its assistance for Afghanistan to £286 million this financial year, and we have now disbursed over £145 million</mark>"
1246,<mark> That will support over 3</mark>
1247,"<mark>4 million people in Afghanistan and the region, providing emergency food, healthcare, shelter, water and protection</mark>"
1248,"<mark> I thank the British people for donating £28 million to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal in December, of which £10 million was doubled by UK aid match funding</mark>"
1249,"<mark> We welcome the decision by the World Bank board in November to transfer £280 million to support the humanitarian response, but it is vitalit is vitalthat the World Bank produces options to allocate the $1</mark>"
1250,<mark>2 billion remaining in the fund</mark>
1251,"<mark>To correct the record, because it is important that we make accurate statements, between April and December 2021 we disbursed over £145 millionworth of aid, £135 million of which went into lifesaving humanitarian support inside Afghanistan, including for food, health, nutrition, shelter, water, sanitation and landmine action</mark>"
1252,<mark> Another £10 million went into neighbouring countries to support new and existing refugees</mark>
1253,"<mark> Just to be clear, £135 million of our aid has gone, to the end of December</mark>"
1254,"<mark> On the funding available to meet this crisis, it is really important that it is all unlocked, which is why I refer again to the importance of unlocking that $1</mark>"
1255,<mark>2 billion within the World Bank</mark>
1256,"<mark> Our armed forces on the ground worked at great speed and in great danger to evacuate around 15,000 people to the UK</mark>"
1257,"<mark> Since the end of Operation Pitting, the UK has supported nearly 1,300 people to leave Afghanistan, including 700 British nationals and eligible dependants</mark>"
1258,<mark> Women now account for more than half of all apprenticeship starts across the country and our apprenticeships diversity champions network is working with employers across the country to make sure we see the improvement we need</mark>
1259,"<mark> It is by no means an exaggeration to say that the country is hurtling towards a humanitarian cliff edge that places millions of Afghans, including millions of children, at risk of starvation</mark>"
1260,<mark> More than 90% of the countrys health clinics and hospitals are without the funds that they need to stay open</mark>
1261,"<mark> With 97% of the Afghan population soon to be living below the poverty line, almost 23 million people are teetering on the edge of starvation</mark>"
1262,"<mark> Banks ran short, millions lost work or went unpaid and the currency nosedived</mark>"
1263,"<mark> Of the £286 million pledged, so far only £81 million has been disbursed</mark>"

1266,"<mark> The word Otherwise at the start of clause 196 currently refers back to clause 195, but it also needs to take account of the provisions of clause 206 which makes provision corresponding to clause 195 for oral hearing fees</mark>"
1267,<mark> The parties rights and obligations in relation to arbitration costs are governed by clauses 19 and 20</mark>
1268,"<mark>With rates of infection high among teenagers, many are simply unable to get double vaccinated yet as they were infected in the period when they would have been eligible and had to wait 12 weeks to get the jab</mark>"
1269,"<mark> Unfortunately for families hoping to travel in half term, they cannot access a covid recovery certificate through the NHS app or through 119, despite contracting covid being the reason that they are not double vaccinated</mark>"
1270,"<mark> Families are facing the prospect of cancelling their travel plans for half term, which will have an impact not only on our constituents but on the travel industry</mark>"
1271,"<mark> I know that the Department is considering a solution, but will the Minister give some clarity that that will be achieved before half term, to give people the confidence to make travel plans</mark>"
1272,"<mark>Before Christmas, the JCVI issued the welcome guidance that five to 11yearolds who are either clinically vulnerable or living with someone who is immunosuppressed should be vaccinated against coronavirus, but since then we have heard very little</mark>"
1273,"<mark> Can the Minister tell me when the rollout to five to 11yearolds will start, whether it will take place in schools or in vaccination centres, and how those who are immunocompromised will be identifiedthis is very important to those who are living with someone in that positiongiven that their GP records will not show their condition I declare a personal interest</mark>"

1276,"<mark> The percentage of women on fulltime STEM undergraduate courses has gone up from 34% to 42% since 2010, and Alevel science entries are up 36% among girls</mark>"
1277,"<mark> Girls now account for more than 50% of all science Alevel entries, and women now  account for over half of all STEM undergraduates</mark>"
1278,<mark> The $4</mark>
1279,<mark>4 billion the UN has appealed for is only a stopgap</mark>
1280,"<mark> But if we do not meet the appeal, it will be £10 billion next year and a lot more suffering</mark>"
1281,"<mark>7 billion, the UK must now step up to the plate to meet the $4</mark>"
1282,<mark>4 billion requested</mark>
1283,"<mark> The UN cannot deliver at the scale and speed needed by working alone, so will global Britain now show global leadership Will the Secretary of State agree to help those in urgent need, including 1 million children who face starvation, by convening a conference, as former Prime Minister Gordon Brown is calling for, with the United States, the EU and other willing partners to agree new financing to fully cover our obligation to this appeal</mark>"
1284,<mark> We have already invested £465 million in a recruitment and retention programme for care home staff</mark>
1285,"<mark>About 15,000 people were brought to the UK</mark>"
1286,"<mark>My constituent Kerry Mackay from the Ceiriog valley has overcome hardship and just  been named one of the top 100 most inspirational and dynamic female entrepreneurs in the UK for her business ScrubbiesUK, which makes environmentally friendly cleaning pads</mark>"
1287,"<mark> Our startup loans company has advanced more than 35,000 loans to women since 2012, worth nearly £300 million, and that represents 40% of all loans</mark>"
1288,"<mark> Friend the Chancellor, including oneoff grants of up to £6,000 per premises for the hospitality sector and £30 million through the culture recovery fund</mark>"
1289,"<mark> Members will be aware, the Bill defines a business tenancy as a tenancy to which part 2 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 appliesthat is to say it is a tenancy comprised of property that is or includes premises that are occupied by the tenant for business purposes</mark>"
1290,"<mark> A tenant will still be in occupation if they are operating their business remotely and intend to return, so I do not believe amendment 9 is necessary</mark>"
1291,"<mark> As I have previously explained, clause 17 establishes the timeframe for making awards, requiring arbitrators to make an award as soon as is practicable, or within 14 days in the case of an oral hearing</mark>"
1292,<mark> That means that it is hard for an arbitrator to know exactly when final proposals have been submitted and when the clock on the 14day time limit would start running</mark>
1293,"<mark> Imposing a 14day time limit for issuing awards following an oral hearing, as the Bill doesalthough the time limit can be extendedis less problematic because the arbitrator will have seen the final proposals and had time to consider them before the hearing</mark>"
1294,"<mark> Amendments 1 and 2 are technical amendments to make it clear that the definition of service charge in clause 2 covers both fixed and variable costs, as well as costs incurred by the landlord insuring against loss of rent</mark>"
1295,"<mark> Amendments 4 and 7 make it clear that the general rule is that the party that has paid fees is to be reimbursed half the amount by the other party, but where appropriate, the arbitrator may determine a different proportion, including zero</mark>"
1296,"<mark> Amendment 5 makes a small correction to clause 196 to make it clear that except for reimbursement of arbitration or oral hearing fees, a party must meet its own legal or other costs</mark>"
1297,<mark> Amendment 6 makes it clear that costs incurred in connection with arbitration are not recoverable under an existing clause in the lease</mark>
1298,"<mark> The Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Department for the Economy have requested the removal of the existing delegated power for them to make regulations for purposes corresponding to the purposes of the Bill, set out in clause 28</mark>"
1299,"<mark> The removal of clause 28 necessitates an amendment to the Extent provision in clause 302, which currently refers to this provision</mark>"
1300,"<mark>It is a pleasure to speak to new clause 1 and amendments 9 to 17, which stand in my name and in the name of my hon</mark>"
1301,"<mark> On that basis, we have tabled new clause 1 and our other amendments in a positive spirit, to continue the dialogue that we had at the earlier stages of the Bill, because we support it and want it to work as effectively as possible</mark>"
1302,"<mark> Predictability and consistency will be vital if those businesses are to have faith in the system, so   our new clause 1 would require the Secretary of State to conduct a review of awards to assess whether clauses 15 and 16 have been interpreted consistently</mark>"
1303,"<mark> Clause 9 establishes a sixmonth period for a tenant or landlord to make a reference to arbitration, for which the clock starts on the day on which the Act is passed</mark>"
1304,<mark> Amendment 10 reflects the suggestion by Bill Chandler of Hill Dickinson LLP  that the date for referrals to open be fixed as 25 March 2022 irrespective of whether the legislation is passed</mark>
1305,<mark> Could the Minister update the House on those discussions Clause 19 gives the Secretary of State the discretion to specify ceilings for arbitration fees in secondary legislation</mark>
1306,"<mark> Given the concerns of stakeholders and the financial pressures they are facing, the Secretary of State should be required to set a limit on arbitration fees, and that is the intention of amendment 16</mark>"
1307,"<mark> That is why we have tabled amendment 17, which would remove this arbitrary cutoff date</mark>"
1308,"<mark> The Governments impact assessment assumes 8,200 cases going to arbitration in its central scenario</mark>"
1309,<mark> The intention of amendment 13 is to make that an explicit and ongoing duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that the arbitral bodies appointed have sufficient numbers of arbitrators to hear and report on all cases as quickly as possible</mark>
1310,<mark> The British Retail Consortium estimated in December that 80% to 90% of its members had reached agreement</mark>
1311,"<mark> That is why our amendment 14 revises clause 11 and requires a formal proposal to be accompanied by all evidence relevant to the proposal, whether helpful to that party or not</mark>"
1312,"<mark> Although a 5050 split is fair in most cases, it is right that the arbitrator has the power to change how the arbitration fees are split, particularly if one party has acted unreasonably</mark>"
1313,"<mark> That is why we have tabled amendment 12, which would provide the arbitrator with the power to make an adverse cost award, where one party has caused the other to incur costs by acting unreasonably</mark>"
1314,"<mark> While clause 17 requires the arbitrator to make their award within 14 days  in a case in which an oral hearing is held, where no oral hearing is held the arbitrator is required to make their award as soon as reasonably practicable</mark>"
1315,<mark> Labours amendment 15 intends to ensure that awards are made within a specific timeframe irrespective of whether there is an oral hearing</mark>
1316,"<mark>Amendments made 19, page 16, leave out lines 14 and 15</mark>"
1317,"<mark> The rest of clause 302 which provides that Part 4 of the Bill extends to the whole of the UK is reproduced in Amendment 20, so the whole of clause 302 can be omitted</mark>"
1318,"<mark> Indeed, the Bills impact assessment notes that, according to the Treasury analysis, the total amount of deferred rent liabilities may be at around £9 billion by March 2022</mark>"
1319,"<mark> UKHospitality found that the average hospitality venue lost over £10,000 in the weeks leading up to Christmas, with Christmas day takings down 60% compared with those in 2019</mark>"
1320,"<mark> A December surveythe period between some of the stages of the Billby the Night Time Industries Association found that the outstanding business debt from their members was, on average, around over £200,000 per unit</mark>"
1321,"<mark> That is why we have had a package of £750 million of support for charities, which indicates their importance and how they have been involved throughout the pandemic</mark>"
1322,"<mark> One of them will be in procurement, which is worth £300 billion a year to our economy</mark>"
1323,"<mark> Bearing in mind the Prime Ministers distant relationship with the truth, will the Minister outline exactly how the public, and Covid19 Bereaved Families for Justice, can have any faith in this inquiry at all</mark>"
1324,"<mark> However, I am very pleased to say that in November 2019, the public prosecutors office in Bahrain announced the release of 75 prisoners, most of whom claimed that they were in prison for political reasons, so it is not true that socalled political prisoners have not been released</mark>"
1325,<mark> I also saw a large noticeboard in the police headquarters that seemed to have well over 100 photographs of young policemen and quite a few policewomen who had been murdered by terrorists</mark>
1326,"<mark> During Bahrains popular prodemocracy uprising 11 years ago, the regime demolished 38 Shia Muslim mosques</mark>"
1327,"<mark> Following that attack, 64 political prisoners were forcibly disappeared for 19 days and held incommunicado for between 30 and 36 days, during which time they were unable to contact their families or their lawyers, in a flagrant violation of both national and international law</mark>"
1328,<mark> It is to the credit of Lewis Hamilton and others that they used their substantial media presence to highlight human rights abuses in Bahrain when they were there for the Formula 1 race</mark>
1329,"<mark> The best response of Formula 1 would be to say that it will refuse to go countries where there are significant human rights abuses, rather than expecting drivers individually to make such statements</mark>"
1330,"<mark> Over the last five years, we have seen the cyber sector grow significantly, with more than 1,400 businesses generating revenues of £8</mark>"
1331,"<mark>9 billion last year alone, and supporting 46,700 skilled jobs</mark>"
1332,"<mark> That is also why we are targeting key sectors as part of that strategy, such as through the CyberFirst programme, which will ensure that 6,500 pupils from 600 schools can benefit, in particular by attracting girls into that competition so that they are a part of the cyberstrategy</mark>"
1333,"<mark> They should be subject to the normal rules that the rest of us expect, with an accountable police force, a transparent legal system and prison conditions that do not allow torture or force 12 people into a very small cell, which itself is a torture</mark>"
1334,"<mark> Dr alSingace is one of an estimated 1,400 political prisoners being held in Jau prison, 500 of whom have been sentenced to 20 years or more</mark>"
1335,<mark> It is of equal importance that the debate gives us the opportunity to question the Government and ask once again why they continue to turn a blind eye to human rights abuses in Bahrain while sending millions of pounds of taxpayers cash to the Gulf state via the highly secretive Gulf strategy fund</mark>
1336,<mark> A freedom of information request by the Scottish National party revealed that the Gulf strategy fund was increased by 145% last year</mark>
1337,"<mark> Arguably, the most urgent of these cases is that of Dr alSingace, the 59yearold academic and human rights activist who was initially detained in 2010, having returned from speaking at a conference in the House of Lords</mark>"
1338,"<mark> In October last year, 46 parliamentarians signed an open letter to the Foreign Secretary asking her to intervene on behalf of Dr alSingace and his family, but I am sorry to say that nothing has been done and the Government have remained largely silent</mark>"
1339,"<mark> Another case worthy of highlighting is that of 74yearold Hassan Mushaima, the former leader of Bahrains opposition, who is also serving a life sentence, having been jailed in the aftermath of the prodemocracy uprising in 2011</mark>"
1340,"<mark> In December, Ali held his own hunger strike outside the Bahraini embassy here in London for 23 days, demanding the release of all political prisoners, including his father</mark>"
1341,"<mark> Of the 26 people awaiting execution in Bahrain, no fewer than 12 have been convicted of political charges</mark>"
1342,<mark> A recent report by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy and Reprieve found that executions in Bahrain have increased by a factor of 10 since the UK began its financial assistance through the integrated activity fund in 2017</mark>
1343,"<mark> One of them will be in procurement, which is worth £300 billion a year to our economy</mark>"
1344,"<mark> We draw on 100 years of probation experience, for example, and we are using it to encourage and support Bahrainiled judicial reform</mark>"
1345,"<mark> To date, more than 3,600 individuals have had potential prison time replaced by alternative sentences, and further cases remain under consideration by the judiciary</mark>"
1346,<mark> I remind the House that more than 90 security personal have been prosecuted or face disciplinary action because of investigations carried out by human rights oversight bodies that the UK Government support</mark>
1347,"<mark> We have heard much about Mr alSingace this afternoon, a 59yearold academic languishing in prison following his peaceful opposition to Bahrains dictatorship during the 2011 Arab spring</mark>"
1348,<mark> I fully support earlyday motion 578 calling for the UK Government to impose Magnitsky sanctions on those responsible for the unlawful imprisonment of Dr alSingace</mark>
1349,"<mark> It is even more curious that, while the UK Government were cutting humanitarian aid by billions last year, including for clean water and nutrition, their support for the Gulf strategy fund, the former integrated activity fund, increased by 154%</mark>"
1350,"<mark> However, while the pressure for such an inquiry grows, the fund continues to operate, despite billions of pounds of cuts to international aid spending by this Government</mark>"
1351,<mark> I hope to meet Bahraini authorities and FCDO officials in the coming months and encourage colleagues to sign earlyday motion 835 on human rights in Bahrain to express our collective concern about the situation and support a true path to reform</mark>
1352,"<mark> At Christmas, I delivered hampers of fresh local produce to over 100 veterans across the Workington constituency to thank them for their service</mark>"
1353,<mark> The meeting also took place following the arrest and abuse of 13 children who were subjected to threats of rape and electric shock</mark>
1354,"<mark> There are currently about 1,500 political prisoners in the small kingdom, according to the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy</mark>"
1355,"<mark> I would say that Muslim women in particular experience a triple whammy of race, faith and gender, and Tell MAMA has told us of the 40% increase in abuse against Muslim women during the lockdown</mark>"
1356,"<mark> Polling by Compassion in Politics shows that more than 80% of social media users would provide evidence to get verified accounts, and making verified accounts the default optionnot the only optionwould help to stop some of the abuse</mark>"
1357,"<mark> He was just 13 when he died, and he had his whole life ahead of him</mark>"
1358,<mark> None of those 11 platforms took down that content</mark>
1359,"<mark> They are always looking for the next chink in our digital armour, so I am glad that paragraph 186 of the report makes it clear that we need to act on the human consequences of online fraudnot just the financial  effects, but the psychological effects</mark>"
1360,<mark> I welcome the recommendations that clause 414 be amended to add an offence of fraud and similarly that related clauses be introduced or amended so that companies are required to address it proactively</mark>
1361,"<mark> As such, I support the Committees recommendations in paragraphs 268 to 271 of the report, which would bring such advertising into scope</mark>"
1362,"<mark> The reason for all this is cynically simple the more that people view this content and stay on the platform, the more advertisements that the big tech companies are able to sell, and 99% of Facebooks income is from advertising</mark>"

1364,"<mark> Some 76% of girls aged 12 to 18, and 41% of all women, have reported being sent unsolicited penis images</mark>"
1365,"<mark> According to the dating app Bumble, 48% of millennial women said they had been sent an unsolicited sexual image in the last year alone</mark>"
1366,"<mark> First, if the reports suggestion of replacing clause 11 of the Bill with a list of online harms is accepted by the Government, pornography should be listed as an online harm</mark>"
1367,"<mark> For many of us in this House it was troubling that the Government in 2019 abandoned part 3 of the Digital Economy Act 2017, leaving children with no protection online</mark>"
1368,"<mark> In the interim, the Government must implement part 3 of the 2017 Act, and then the design code and this Bill can be used to offer greater protection</mark>"
1369,<mark> Even fines of £50 million are not significant against Facebooks gross revenue of more than £29 billion</mark>
1370,"<mark> Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe Damian Collins, its Chairman, has done excellent work on this, particularly in pages 58 to 60 and 75 to 79 of the report</mark>"
1371,"<mark> Up to 40% of all crime is now fraud and, as the report says, 85% of fraud involves the internet in some way or other, so it is crucial that we cover this in the Bill</mark>"
1372,"<mark> It needs to be covered under clause 414 and priority illegal content, so that platforms have to be proactive in taking this stuff down</mark>"
1373,<mark> We also need to be looking at clause 39 and removing paidfor ads to make sure that platforms are also proactive in removing paidfor online fraudulent content</mark>
1374,"<mark> At Christmas, I delivered hampers of fresh local produce to over 100 veterans across the Workington constituency to thank them for their service</mark>"

1377,"<mark> To say that he has not prosecuted anyone completely misses the point; 22 files are currently with the prosecution service, but he does not have the resources to process them in a timely manner</mark>"
1378,<mark> It is a great tribute to those working in our NHS that almost eight out of 10 eligible adults in England are now boosted</mark>
1379,"<mark> Suicide remains a major public health problem, with the highest suicide rates among men aged 45 to 49</mark>"
1380,<mark> It is the biggest killer of young people aged 16 to 24 and the suicide rate for young women is now at its highest on record</mark>
1381,<mark> A 2017 inquiry into suicides of young people found suiciderelated internet use in nearly 26% of deaths in under20s and 13% of deaths in 20 to 24year olds</mark>
1382,<mark> One in 15 adults in England report that they have selfharmed</mark>
1383,"<mark> In 11 sitting weeks, we received more than 200 submissions of written evidence, took oral evidence from 50 witnesses and held four further roundtable meetings with outside experts, as well as Members of both Houses</mark>"
1384,"<mark> I know some Members have suggested that a Joint Committee on online harms would have terms of reference mirroring those of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Intelligence and Security Committee, but the Joint Committee on Human Rights was certainly never enshrined in the Human Rights Act 1998, and the responsibility of the Intelligence and Security Committee is to provide oversight for policies, expenditure, and operations adopted by MI5, MI6 and GCHQ</mark>"
1385,"<mark> When I asked about the cost of establishing the Joint Committee, I was told that it would be £500,000 a year</mark>"
1386,<mark>152</mark>
1387,"<mark> As I said, my constituent Joe, a popular young person, was 23, so the fact that he was over 18 did not mean that he was safe from this kind of harmful online content</mark>"
1388,"<mark> I am pleased to see that that matches up with the report, but I appreciate that there is a difference of opinion on whether clause 11 should remain</mark>"
1389,"<mark>I congratulate the Joint Committee on an excellent report, consisting of 191 pages of wellresearched, balanced, temperate and intelligent analysis and recommendations</mark>"
1390,"<mark> Over the last five years, we have seen the cyber sector grow significantly, with more than 1,400 businesses generating revenues of £8</mark>"

1393,"<mark> An estimated 86% of fraud is committed onlineAction Fraud has told us that victims of pensionsrelated scams who had worked their whole lives to build a retirement fund had lost £82,000 on averageOnline platforms, such as search engines and social media platforms, are playing an increasingly significant role in putting consumers at risk of harm by exposing them to adverts for financial productsFraudsters have unprecedentedly cheap access to an online population of consumers who find it difficult to differentiate genuine offers from the fraudulentThere are ads online for firms that dont exist, for firms that claim to be regulated but arent, for firms that claim to be based in the UK but arent and for clones of legitimate authorised firms</mark>"
1394,<mark> The public certainly want that; Aviva has published research concluding that 87% of the public want the Government to legislate to stop search engines and social media platforms promoting financial scams through advertising</mark>
1395,"<mark> It will be years before that work delivers, and in the meantime thousands will have lost their life savings and UK financial services will have suffered further damage</mark>"
1396,<mark> The figure I have is from Action Fraud 85% of the £1</mark>
1397,<mark>7 billion lost in fraudulent scams in the past year resulted from cyberenabled frauds</mark>

1406,"<mark> Friend, whom I have heard speak on this many times over the years, is right that those who went to Northern Ireland to serve Queen and country, to uphold the rule of law, and to resist a brutal, barbaric campaign of Irish republican terror did so courageously, and it is wrong that they should now be hauled through processes for events some of which are 40, 45 years old or even older</mark>"
1407,"<mark>It was so good to hear the Paymaster General praising civil servants, so could he please explain why the Foreign Secretary overruled civil servants advice and went to a £3,000 lunch in a private members club owned by a Tory donor, and he calls that abiding by the code Will the Paymaster General immediately include that in the investigation being undertaken into the other boozy parties in No</mark>"

1414,<mark> There has been over £400 billion of support from the Government as part of our pandemic response</mark>

1420,"<mark> Friend the Member for StokeonTrent Central Jo Gideon said, these amendments would permanently bar, for example, an individual from standing for local office if, perhaps, at 18 they had had a glass of wine too many and were convicted of being slightly over the limit</mark>"
1421,"<mark> New clause 3 may have been supported by the Chancellor in his foreword when he was serving in this role, but he is not the Bill MinisterI amand I believe that Bills such as this should be specific, targeted and focused</mark>"
1422,<mark> Amendments 1 and 4 would selectively remove parish councils from the list of local authorities subject to the new disqualification criteria</mark>
1423,"<mark> Parish councils are already subject to the existing disqualification criteria, and rightly so, as there are 10,000 parish councils and approximately 100,000 parish councillors in England</mark>"
1424,"<mark> I should clarify that the 2017 consultation responses regarding the matter of sexual risk orders were mixed some 39% of respondents were in favour of prohibition, and 45% were against</mark>"
1425,<mark> It is always a stark reminder when I am told that about 75% of women in the world are illiterate</mark>
1426,"<mark> Perhaps inevitably when there are 120,000 councillors serving all tiers of local government in England, however, there are rare occasions when the behaviour of individuals falls below the standards that the public rightly expect</mark>"
1427,<mark> Why should people who are in that position be allowed to continue as councillors while other councillors who have been convicted of a different set of antisocial offences are excluded That is the essence of new clause 1</mark>
1428,"<mark> The new clause is particularly topical, because it fits in with the 10year drugs plan to cut crime and save lives, which Her Majestys Government published in December 2021</mark>"
1429,"<mark> So can we tolerate a situation in which local councillors may themselves have been convicted of offences against the Misuse of Drugs Act, in complete defiance of the Governments strategy, which I think has universal support across the country That is the essence of new clause 2</mark>"
1430,"<mark> In the response to the consultation, they say that 65% of respondents agreed with that proposalthe proposal to disqualify, for such behaviour, from being able to be a councillor, 22% were against and 12% of people did not know</mark>"
1431,"<mark> I submit, with all modesty, that new clause 3 has support at the very highest levels of Government from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as we have not heard anything from him to suggest that he has changed his mind since 2018</mark>"
1432,"<mark> Now we are at that stage, why can we not accept new clause 3 The other amendments I have fit in with what I have just been saying</mark>"
1433,<mark> of an offence under Schedule 3 or Schedule 5 of the 2003 Act but who is nevertheless thought to pose a risk of harm to the public in the UK andor children or vulnerable adults abroad</mark>
1434,"<mark> When we hear from the Minister that the Bill will apply to 100,000 councillors, one can see that this is an issue of significance</mark>"

1443,"<mark> Friend will be aware that, last year, the number of TV licences purchased fell by 700,000, and that more and more young people are now saying that they do not need to watch the BBC because of the enormous amount of choice through the streaming services</mark>"
1444,<mark> How does she believe that the 50 BBC employees based in my constituency are currently feeling because of the announcement she made on Twitter over the weekend</mark>
1445,"<mark> Does she agree that since they are having to tighten their belts, perhaps the BBC should do the same A good place to start might be with salaries, including that of one of its presenters, who earns £1</mark>"
1446,<mark>36 million a year</mark>
1447,"<mark>We have already seen the loss of hundreds of jobs of BBC journalists involved in the muchvalued regional news and current affairs programming, including the excellent Inside Out programme</mark>"
1448,"<mark> Tens of thousands of people supported getting rid of the BBC licence fee and very few were against it, so may I thank the Secretary of State for coming to the House today and making a statement If my Bill is of any use to her, I would be very happy to change in Committee any of the stuff I have there at the moment</mark>"
1449,"<mark>As I said, when the new model starts in 202728, many of us may not even be herewe are talking six years away</mark>"
1450,<mark> I am not going to conflate Channel 4 with the BBC; I am here to talk about the settlement of the licence fee</mark>
1451,"<mark> The BBC, with the billions of pounds of funding£23 billionit is receiving, will still be able to meet its core mission and purposes</mark>"
1452,<mark> It is worth making the point that the BBC will continue to receive billions of pounds of public support and funding between now and 2027</mark>
1453,"<mark> Gentleman talks about £159, but the BBC wanted it to project to £180</mark>"
1454,"<mark>The licence fee settlement ensures that the BBC can continue to meet its mission and its purposes, and it will continue to receive billions of pounds of funding£23 billion over the licence fee settlement period</mark>"
1455,<mark> Gentleman was going to thank me for the additional £7</mark>
1456,<mark>5 million that we are giving to S4C</mark>
1457,"<mark> I thought he was going to thank us for the fact that S4Cs funding, having been frozen for the past five years, is now being increased and we are freezing the BBCs funding</mark>"
1458,"<mark> To enable us to do that, we have recruited 40 new caseworkers, with 35 more in the pipeline for the coming months</mark>"
1459,"<mark>The House divided Ayes 234, Noes 327</mark>"
1460,<mark>1 Section 54 permissible donors of PPERA is amended as follows</mark>
1461,"<mark>The House divided Ayes 237, Noes 322</mark>"
1462,"<mark>In section 11d of the Representation of the People Act 1983 definition of voting age for parliamentary elections, for 18 substitute 16</mark>"
1463,"<mark>The House divided Ayes 236, Noes 327</mark>"
1464,"<mark>Amendment proposed 3, page 37, line 5, leave out Clause 26</mark>"
1465,"<mark>The House divided Ayes 234, Noes 328</mark>"
1466,<mark> Gentleman talks about extending the franchise to 16 and 17yearolds</mark>
1467,"<mark> Does he agree, therefore, that extending the franchise to 16 and 17yearolds, who will go on to develop a far stronger commitment to voting, will actually strengthen our democracy against foreign interference in British politics</mark>"
1468,"<mark> 15, Q13</mark>"
1469,"<mark> We know that 16 and 17yearolds, when given the chance, take it very seriously</mark>"
1470,"<mark> In Scotland and Wales, they have higher rates of turnout than 18 to 24yearolds, with 75% voting and 97% saying that they would vote in future elections</mark>"
1471,"<mark> There has been success in Northern Ireland and voting turnout has increased, but the statistics also show that 98% of voters already have sufficient ID in place for voting, and we are almost there</mark>"
1472,"<mark> All we need is for the other 2% to be done, and Northern Ireland will achieve that goal of having everybody with an ID</mark>"
1473,"<mark> There will be no time limit, but he must resume his seat no later than 8</mark>"
1474,<mark>55</mark>
1475,"<mark> Friend for going through the implications of new clause 11, which I very much welcome</mark>"
1476,"<mark> Members will remember that in law at the moment election campaigns are currently 25 working days, and amendments that I and my hon</mark>"
1477,<mark> Friends tabled the last time these matters were discussed in this place considered shortening campaigns to 25 days</mark>
1478,"<mark> We have to finish this stage of the Bill at 9 oclock, so I shall immediately impose a time limit of five minutes</mark>"
1479,"<mark>If the 75% of 16 and 17yearolds who voted in the Scottish independence referendum did not make their own choice, who voted for them If the research that says that they looked for and discovered the facts and made their own choice is not true, who does the hon</mark>"
1480,<mark> A far higher proportion voted in that group than in the 18to24 age group</mark>
1481,"<mark> I know that he and the Scottish National party do not want to raise the age of marriage to 18; the Scottish Executive have not made it clear so far, but I think they should</mark>"
1482,"<mark> Article 1 in part 1 of the UN convention on the rights of the child says that a child is a child until 18 years of age, so I do not understand why the SNP is still backing child marriage</mark>"
1483,"<mark>With regard to voter participation among 16 and 17yearolds in Scotland, another reason we have such a healthy turnout is that all the elections in which they participate are conducted on a proportional basis</mark>"
1484,"<mark> That is why, Madam Deputy Speaker, I very much hope that you might allow me the chance to test the opinion of the House on new clause 13</mark>"
1485,"<mark> Even where nonphotographic ID was used in the trials and given to everyone, about 1% of people were turned away just because they had forgotten to take it from their house to the polling station</mark>"
1486,"<mark> Now in a number of our seats 1% is a margin of error that would have changed the course of an election, and in tight years it could change the course of who is in government</mark>"
1487,<mark> Member not recognise that the same treaty says that under18s should have a say in the future of their life and have democratic participation in the countries they live in</mark>
1488,"<mark>I heard what the Secretary of State said about S4C, but my constituents would simply not recognise what she says about the rest of the BBC being some sort of London bubble</mark>"
1489,"<mark> We have seen a 54% increase in our creative economy locally, with thousands of people employed and the BBC at the heart of thatDoctor Who, Casualty, Shreds and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales</mark>"
1490,"<mark> Does the Secretary of State agree that 43p a day is value for money for BBC iPlayer, BBC Sounds and the BBC World Service</mark>"
1491,"<mark>I wish the Secretary of State would stop with the crocodile tears about the costofliving crisis, because £159 is a lot of money, particularly for my constituents, but it happens to be exactly the same amount, on average, as they will pay in extra national insurance from April this year</mark>"
1492,"<mark> She says that the BBC gets lots of money, but Sky got five times as much money this year, and its revenues this year increased by 18</mark>"
1493,<mark>9%</mark>
1494,<mark>I think there were about 30 questions in that statement so I will address the top points</mark>
1495,"<mark> Whether getting by on minimum wage or on a multimillionpound presenters salary, we fork out the same amount of money</mark>"
1496,"<mark> Do not be under any illusions the BBC will continue to receive billions of pounds, even under this settlement</mark>"
1497,<mark> It will get £23 billion of public money over the course of the charter to 2027</mark>
1498,"<mark>The BBC, as I have said, will continue to receive billions of poundsworth of funding, and it will continue to meet its mission and core purpose, but I cannot dictate how it spends its money and I do not have editorial control</mark>"
1499,<mark>S4C will receive a further £7</mark>
1500,<mark>5 million per annum from the licence fee to support its digital investment</mark>
1501,"<mark> In total, S4C will be provided with approximately £88 million in licencefee funding per annum</mark>"
1502,"<mark> We are committed to S4C, and we are providing it with additional funding</mark>"
1503,<mark>Many of us find it nauseating that the Secretary of State has come here to talk about hardpressed families when she supported the £20 cut to universal credit</mark>
1504,"<mark> So could we test how much she considered some of these factors, perhaps in the style of the broadcast media How much more money is generated by the investment in the BBC Is it £1, £2 or £3 She talks about the north</mark>"
1505,"<mark> How much of the BBCs economic impact is beyond London Is it 10%, 20% or 50% Perhaps she could demonstrate her knowledge at least of the BBCs impact</mark>"
1506,"<mark>I rise to speak to my new clause 18, and I declare an interest as a member of the allparty parliamentary group on electoral campaigning transparency</mark>"
1507,"<mark> If a donation is over the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 threshold of £25,000 in a calendar year, the UA will have to disclose whatever details it knows of the name and address of the person who made the gift, but it would not be prevented from receiving and then donating that gift</mark>"
1508,"<mark> Perhaps the most infamous example is the Democratic Unionist partys £435,000 donation to Vote Leave, which was channelled via a UA, the Constitutional Research Council</mark>"
1509,"<mark> It was consequently fined just £6,000a penalty totalling little more than 1% of its donations, which could well simply be seen as the cost of doing business</mark>"
1510,<mark> Those clubs have given well over £1 million to the Conservatives</mark>
1511,"<mark> New clause 18 would quite simply require unincorporated associations that meet the threshold for registration with the Electoral Commission to conduct checks to establish whether a person donating for political purposes is a permissible donor and, if not, to reject that donation as the Committee on Standards in Public Life has recommended</mark>"
1512,"<mark>I rise to speak to new clause 16, in my name and that of Members from four of the parties represented here in Westminster</mark>"
1513,"<mark>EU and the mysterious source of his gigantic loans from Rock Servicesor was it Rock Holdings Thanks to evidence given to Carole Cadwalladr and the heroic reporting of The Guardian, we know that there are all kinds of interesting and no doubt innocent connections, such as the fact that Mr Bankss wife, Katya Banks, was given entry into the country on a passport serially numbered to a passport given to someone who MI5 reported as a Russian spy</mark>"
1514,"<mark> Let us take another honourable donor, Mr Mohamed Amersi, a man who together with his partner has given   nearly £800,000 to good causes and who, it would seem, might qualify for a walkon part in John le Carrs The Night Manager, but not as Jonathan Pine</mark>"
1515,"<mark> The point is that I can raise questions here that warrant further investigationquestions about, for example, Lubov Chernukhin, the model of generosity who has given the Conservatives £2</mark>"
1516,"<mark>1 million, £1</mark>"
1517,<mark>9 million of it after her husband Vladimirthe same Vladimir who was appointed by Mr Putins deputy chairman of Vnesheconombankreceived money from Suleiman Kerimov</mark>
1518,"<mark> This was a man who was later sanctioned by the United States Treasury, and not only for being a Russian Government official he was arrested in France for smuggling in hundreds of millions of euros in suitcases</mark>"
1519,<mark>2 million to the Conservative party</mark>
1520,"<mark> He works with another honourable man, Mr Fedotov, who is a key shareholder in Aquind Ltd, which, The Guardian reports, has donated £700,000 to the Conservative party, along with another firm</mark>"
1521,"<mark> Amendments 1 and 5 would remove from the Bill the voter identification provisions, which are said to protect our democracy by requiring people to have photographic identification in order to vote, so as to prevent personation</mark>"
1522,"<mark> In 2019, 59 million votes were cast and there was a single conviction for voter personation</mark>"
1523,"<mark>I have significant issues with new clause 13, as drafted, which simply asks to introduce a proportional system</mark>"
1524,<mark> I am also a strong believerthis speaks to new clause 5 in the name of the hon</mark>
1525,"<mark> It allows a person to call up any and every local authority to say that they were resident in the area 30 or 40 years ago, provide flimsy proofit will not be photo identification, that is for sureand then be able to donate massive sums of money</mark>"
1526,"<mark> New clause 2 would simply prevent anyone registered as such an overseas elector from donating to political parties in the UK, while new clause 9 would require individual and company donors to be based in the UK while making those in charge of companies liable for any offences caused</mark>"
1527,<mark> We also have new clause 16 tabled by my right hon</mark>
1528,<mark> The Bill takes away the barriers that kept it at £1 million</mark>
1529,"<mark> The strength of feeling on the issue is shown by the variety of other new clauses2, 8, 16 and 18that cover that subject</mark>"
1530,<mark> Amendment 3 would remove those provisions</mark>
1531,"<mark> Similarly, we will support amendments 11 and 12, which delete parts of this provision</mark>"
1532,"<mark> However, the sheer volume of changes and changed directions in the Bill is a sign of how halfbaked it started</mark>"
1533,"<mark>Despite the fact that the removal of the free licence for the over75s was a result of her own partys actions, the Secretary of States tweet yesterday indicated that her  attack on the BBC was due to the over75s being threatened with prison sentences and bailiffs knocking on their doors</mark>"
1534,"<mark> 706, c</mark>"
1535,<mark> 131</mark>
1536,"<mark> In November, the Home Affairs Committee found that only 20% of claimants had applied, and that only 5% had received any compensation</mark>"
1537,<mark> There are members of that Committee who have yet to speak and the time is now 8</mark>
1538,<mark>000058% of all the votes cast</mark>
1539,"<mark> If the Minister is seeking to bring about compromise on this important Bill, she could do that by accepting new clause 2</mark>"
1540,<mark> We lose 2 million voters and that is the snapshot they use to propose a boundary change to reduce the number of MPs to 600</mark>
1541,<mark> Then a general election throws up some different results and suddenly we are back up to 650 MPs</mark>
1542,"<mark>Over 180 years ago, starting in Blaenau Gwent, thousands of Chartists marched on Newport</mark>"
1543,"<mark> Despite the highest election turnout in 120 years, the big lie has been amplified that Trump actually won in 2020</mark>"
1544,<mark> That would make far better use of the millions that voter ID will cost</mark>
1545,<mark> I urge all Members who value our democracy to support amendment 1</mark>
1546,"<mark> With that in mind, I put particular focus on new clause 11 and new schedule 1, which have been put forward by the Government</mark>"
1547,<mark> That information would then be published on the returning officers statement of persons nominated by virtue of Rule 143A</mark>
1548,"<mark> First, on new clause 1 and voter ID, others have spoken movinglyboth in evidence to the Bill Committee and this eveningabout the impact of voter fraud and the need to take reasonable steps to minimise it</mark>"
1549,"<mark> The proposal would still demonstrate locality but would protect candidates from the Hobsons choice of being outside the constituency, albeit by 100 yards, or having to display their full postal address</mark>"
1550,"<mark> This is also similar to new clause 10, tabled by the hon</mark>"
1551,"<mark> Imposing a paltry £20,000 fine has been shown to be no deterrent whatsoever</mark>"
1552,"<mark> We believe that our proposal for a maximum fine of £500,000 or 5% of an organisations or individuals total spend will give the commission far greater power to act as a genuine deterrent to lawbreakers</mark>"
1553,<mark> This new paragraph for rule 37 of Schedule 1 to the Representation of the People Act 1983 would be inserted immediately after paragraph 1IA inserted into that rule by Amendment 84</mark>
1554,<mark> These new paragraphs would be inserted immediately after paragraph 1IC inserted by Amendment 85</mark>
1555,"<mark> As Lord Grade said on the Today programme this morning, nearly £160 is nothing to Gary Lineker, but it is a lot to our constituents</mark>"
1556,"<mark> However, in terms of Yorkshire and the location of Channel 4s new headquarters, how does todays announcement impact on the timescale for announcements about Channel 4s future</mark>"
1557,<mark> That settlement provides around £20 million of S4C programming annually in addition  to the Welsh language services provided by BBC Radio Cymru and Radio Cymru 2 and by BBC Cymru Fyw</mark>
1558,<mark> It reaches 468 million people in 42 languages around the world every week</mark>
1559,<mark>On the Conservative side we have a proud history with S4C</mark>
1560,"<mark> I thank the Secretary of State for putting S4C at the core of her statement, and for the £7</mark>"
1561,<mark>5 million increase per annum</mark>
1562,"<mark> Could I draw her into a meeting with me and likeminded colleagues about the Welsh language, and the fact that core public service broadcasters have nurtured it and helped it grow, such as S4C and BBC Radio Cymru</mark>"
1563,"<mark> In supporting her statement and helping the BBC to achieve its objectives under the new settlement, will she call on the BBC to follow other public sector organisations in improving its transparency and to publish every invoice in excess of £500, just like every other organisation does</mark>"
1564,<mark>Is there any truth in the reports that the Government want to have asylum seekers processed offshore in countries such as Gambia Has any such country actually agreed to this Does the Secretary of State accept that having people processed hundreds or thousands of miles away might meet the letter of our obligations to asylum seekers but certainly does not meet the spirit</mark>
1565,"<mark> To that end, we have tabled new clause 11 and new schedule 1 to provide powers to introduce an online absent vote application service and an online voter card application service</mark>"
1566,"<mark> New clause 11 and new schedule 1 will enable the identity of applicants using those services to be verified, as well as identity verification for paper absent vote applications, as is already the case for registration applications</mark>"
1567,"<mark> Amendments 53 to 56 and amendments 62 to 65 will ensure that any elector who does not possess one of the wide range of photographic identification documents accepted under our proposals would be able to apply for a voter card or anonymous electors document when registering to vote, thus simplifying and making the system more accessible</mark>"
1568,"<mark> It is also important that voter cards and anonymous electors documents are designed appropriately, and amendments 61 and 70 provide some additional flexibility around how to ensure that</mark>"
1569,"<mark> Amendments 82, 84 and 87 will help ensure clarity</mark>"
1570,"<mark> In line with other registration decisions, amendment 74 introduces an appeal process against the refusal of an application for a voter card or absent vote</mark>"
1571,<mark> 371</mark>
1572,"<mark> One way the Government could gauge public opinion without the rancour and animosity that we sometimes see here would be to embrace the idea of citizens assemblies, as we propose in new clause 3</mark>"
1573,"<mark> New clause 5 would bring UK election law into line with that of Scotland, where a person sentenced to a term of 12 months or less does not lose their right to participate in elections</mark>"
1574,"<mark> New clause 5 would also bring the UK into line with the European Court of Human Rights, which has declared that a blanket ban on prisoners voting is a breach of protocol 1, article 3 of the European convention on human rights</mark>"
1575,"<mark> That was no accident because, having already added 16 and 17yearolds and EU nationals, in 2020 the Scottish Parliament further extended the franchise to include all foreign nationals with leave to remain, including refugees</mark>"
1576,"<mark> 10 Downing Street, but let us also accept that the culture of Parliament has to change</mark>"
1577,<mark> The existence of  areas where parties can depend on the return of a Member of Parliament with a majority of tens of thousands without making any real effort creates that sense of entitlement</mark>
1578,"<mark> We had one big pilot, though, and it was in Northern Ireland, where 2</mark>"
1579,<mark>3% of the electorate dropped out</mark>
1580,"<mark> If we extrapolate that to our electorate here, that would mean over 1 million people dropping out</mark>"
1581,"<mark>The family in Cumbria that the Secretary of State talked about, who were streaming five different movies in five different rooms, are probably paying a minimum of £43 a month for Netflix, Sky and broadband</mark>"
1582,"<mark>When the BBC came before the Public Accounts Committee, it was striking how unambitious its target was for growing commercial revenues, which represent just 6% of its current income</mark>"
1583,"<mark> Given the millions across the United Kingdom and abroad who do love the BBC, there must be countless options for future funding models for content that can be commercialised, but does my right hon</mark>"
1584,"<mark>Will the Secretary of State say what impact assessment she has done of the impact that the change will have on households if fees were increased What will be the impact on services provided by the BBC as a consequence of these freezes to its income, on top of the 31% that it has had cut from its income over the past 10 years How will that affect the services provided by the BBC, and how will they survive her plans for the BBC</mark>"
1585,"<mark> Given that inflation is expected to rise to 6% in the early parts of this year, what conversations has the Secretary of State had about which content will be reduced as a result of the decision she is making today</mark>"
1586,"<mark> Friend the Member for Maldon Mr Whittingdale highlighted, 700,000 fewer people are paying the licence fee</mark>"
1587,"<mark>It is billions of pounds, and I do not believe that any family receiving repeated letters, or a bailiff knocking on their door, or a request to appear at a magistrates court would think it is value for money, because it is money they cannot afford</mark>"
1588,"<mark> The issue is that working families and people who are hard pressed in the current situation of rising inflationary pressures think it is difficult to pay £159 a year out of their income, which is why we are freezing the licence fee for the next two years and not allowing it to rise</mark>"
1589,<mark>S4Cs settlement will consolidate S4Cs current £74</mark>
1590,<mark>5 million licence funding with its current £6</mark>
1591,<mark>8 million annual DCMS grant income</mark>
1592,"<mark> Gentleman has talked about, that is a fact because we have frozen the licence fee for two years, but S4Cs funding, which has not increased for five years, will now increase</mark>"
1593,"<mark> S4Cs funding has been frozen for the past five years, and it will now increase</mark>"
1594,"<mark> Member will be aware that the changes we made in December 2020 saw us pay considerably more compensation, offering an average of £3</mark>"
1595,"<mark>1 million a month, with more than £38</mark>"
1596,<mark>7 million in compensation now offered</mark>
1597,<mark> When people signed up for a ticket it said All under18s need to be accompanied by an adult or guardian at Labour Live</mark>
1598,"<mark> In fact, if we were to replicate the findings of the pilots he relies on across the country, 184,000 people who wanted to vote would be turned away and would not return</mark>"
1599,"<mark> That makes it 184,000 to one; this is racking up faster than Downing Street parties</mark>"
1600,"<mark> The Cabinet Office itself says that that approach will exclude 2% of the electorate without the right form of ID, but according to the Electoral Commission the actual figure of those without the right ID will be between 1 million and 3</mark>"
1601,<mark>5 million</mark>
1602,"<mark> Some 77% of people in the UK hold a full driving licence, whereas the figure for black people is 53% and the one for Asian people is 61%</mark>"
1603,"<mark> However, I have to say that elections in Wycombe in some quarters need cleaning up, so I welcome the Bill</mark>"
1604,<mark> New clause 15 was tabled by my hon</mark>
1605,"<mark> I would far rather we converged consistently on the age of 18, rather than talking about 16 and 17yearolds</mark>"
1606,"<mark> Amendment 1, from the Opposition Front Bench team, deals with removing the voter ID provisions, and I have touched on that already</mark>"
1607,"<mark> Amendment 116 seeks to apply provisions in the Bill to amend the voting and candidacy rights of European citizens to the relevant elections in the City of London, which are governed by a unique legislative frame work</mark>"
1608,<mark> Any concerns that we might have had about 16 and 17yearolds not being interested in politics or being unable to understand the issues have been shown to be without any foundation</mark>
1609,"<mark> 1 Acacia Drive and, I live at No</mark>"
1610,<mark> 3 Acacia Drive</mark>
1611,"<mark> I was going to make a brief comment on them, but given recent revelations in the press, I might say that they are the height of hypocrisy, especially new clause 16</mark>"
1612,<mark> I just sat on a private Members Bill Committee on increasing the age at which people can get married from 16 to 18 in England</mark>
1613,"<mark> Who is making that decision The argument was made, and basically accepted by the Opposition, that 16 and 17yearolds are not making it themselves</mark>"
1614,"<mark> Also, why are we not talking about 13, 14 or 15yearolds I cannot understand why 16 is being particularly aimed for, especially when other thingsInterruption</mark>"
1615,"<mark> I think that with 18 we have hit a new level that we agree on, so I do not understand why we would want to open that up again</mark>"
1616,"<mark> Just under 31% of people voted Conservative in 1997, and 43% voted Conservative in 2019</mark>"
1617,<mark> Friend the Member for Bosworth Dr Evans will speak in support of his new clause 17</mark>
1618,"<mark> Friend the Member for Heywood and Middleton Chris Clarkson spoke better than I  can about new clause 5, as did my right hon</mark>"
1619,<mark> Friend the Member for Basingstoke Mrs Miller about new clause 11 and new schedule 11</mark>
1620,<mark> Why should some people be able to vote more than others It just does not sit right with me that I could potentially vote hundreds of times if I had hundreds of properties across the country</mark>
1621,<mark> Let me say briefly at the outset that the fact that the House has less than two and a half hours in which to debate such a Bill on Report is nothing short of an outrage</mark>
1622,<mark> It was this Conservative Government who abolished automatic free television licences for the over75s</mark>
1623,"<mark> If pensioners are struggling with the BBC fee rate of 43p a day, imagine how they will cope with the cost of a Netflix or Sky subscription model</mark>"
1624,<mark> The Tory right hates the BBC almost as much as it hates  Channel 4</mark>
1625,"<mark> She does not want to see Krishnan GuruMurthy lead presenter of Channel 4 News, or Nick Robinsona former chair of the Young Conservatives no less, and now lead presenter on the Today programmepin down the Prime Minister or his slippery apologists</mark>"
1626,"<mark> If the BBC is felled, and Channel 4 privatised, free speech will be the victim, and we knowdo we not, Mr Speakerthat the result will be yet more obsequious, unquestioning news</mark>"
1627,"<mark> I mean, pull the other one What is it about the £13</mark>"
1628,"<mark> The last time they targeted it, the over75s paid the price</mark>"
1629,"<mark> If the Government were truly serious about improving democratic engagement and modernising democracy, they would extend the franchise to 16 and 17yearolds who live in this country</mark>"
1630,"<mark> We already expect to remain connected to 16 and 17yearolds through education, employment or training</mark>"
1631,"<mark> We have raised the age of marriage to 18, we have raised the age at which people have to be in education or training from 16 to 18, and the age at which you can smoke was raised by the Labour Government to 18</mark>"
1632,"<mark> We have raised the age at which people can buy a lottery ticket from 16 to 18, I am sure with the Oppositions support, as well as the age at which people can buy alcohol</mark>"
1633,"<mark> Voting is an adult activity; it is something that adults doif we want to encourage younger people to vote, I see no reason why we cannot introduce votes  at 12</mark>"
1634,<mark> I think all the arguments advanced by Opposition Front Benchers could also apply to 12yearolds</mark>
1635,"<mark> However, on the new clause, I rise to ask what is the rationale for choosing the age of 16, when people are not considered to be responsible enough to decide whether to buy cigarettes, rather than some other agesay, 15 or 14</mark>"
1636,"<mark> Member for Bath Wera Hobhouse, if we look at the age of the people leading the fight against climate change and the demonstrators at COP26, we see that overwhelmingly they were young people making their voices heard above everybody elses</mark>"
1637,"<mark>Amendments made 13, page 26, line 29, leave out Minister for the Cabinet Office and insert Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities</mark>"
1638,"<mark>Amendment made 18, page 45, line 29, leave out Minister and insert Secretary of State</mark>"
1639,"<mark> In line with the recommendation from the independent review of S4C completed in 2018, the licence fee will be the sole source of public funding for S4C</mark>"
1640,"<mark> In addition, this Government set out our own relevant factors to consider during the charter review in 201516 evasion, commercial income, household growth and industry costs</mark>"
1641,"<mark> Beyond our shores, the BBC broadcasts our values and  identities all over the world, reaching hundreds of millions every day</mark>"
1642,"<mark> Likewise, the Welsh broadcaster S4C plays a unique and critical role in promoting the Welsh language, and in supporting our wider public service broadcasting landscape</mark>"
1643,"<mark> Instead, it will remain fixed at £159 until April 2024</mark>"
1644,<mark> The approach to funding will be the same for the BBC and for S4C</mark>
1645,"<mark> However, I can announce that S4C will receive an additional £7</mark>"
1646,"<mark>5 million funding per annum from 2022, to support the development of its digital offering</mark>"
1647,"<mark> That is a 9% increase, following five years of frozen funding</mark>"
1648,"<mark> Let us not forget that the BBC will continue to receive billions in annual public funding, allowing it to deliver its mission and public purposes and to continue doing what it does best</mark>"
1649,<mark> The BBCs own leadership rightly recognised those findings in full and committed to deliver all the reviews recommendations in its 10 point action plan on impartiality and editorial standards</mark>
1650,<mark> Some 97% of homes already have superfast broadband</mark>
1651,<mark> More than 65% of UK households now have access to the fastest connection on the planet</mark>
1652,<mark> Some 97% of homes in the UK have superfast broadbandInterruption</mark>
1653,"<mark> As I said, 97% of homes have superfast broadband, and we are rolling out gigabit</mark>"
1654,"<mark> This is not based on whether people can achieve streaming or not, but 100% of households achieving superfast broadband or gigabit broadband is the objective</mark>"
1655,"<mark> In 2019 the Government brought in the Navy to patrol the channel, and those patrols ended after just six weeks, having cost £780,000 and without a single boat having been intercepted</mark>"
1656,"<mark> Rather than having someones full address or the constituency in which they live, there might be a halfway house that allows candidates to show that they have identity in the area while at the same time preserving their safety</mark>"
1657,"<mark> More than 40 signatories, many of whom are in this Chamber, have agreed to support it</mark>"
1658,"<mark> New clause 11 contains flexibility, and I therefore urge the Government to explore this issue further</mark>"
1659,"<mark> I also welcome new clause 17, tabled by my hon</mark>"
1660,"<mark> Some provisions in parts 5, 6 and 7, and in certain schedules to the Bill, currently refer to the Minister</mark>"
1661,<mark> That is defined in clause 60 as meaning the Secretary of State or the Minister for the Cabinet Office</mark>
1662,"<mark>I rise to speak in support of new clause 1, as well as new clauses 3 to 8, tabled in my name and that of my hon</mark>"
1663,"<mark> 754, c</mark>"
1664,<mark> 980</mark>
1665,"<mark>I cannot promise to be as succinct as I was in my last speech before you, Madam Deputy Speaker, which clocked in at a loquacious 10 words, but I will do my best</mark>"
1666,"<mark> As a member of the Electoral Reform Society, I have to say that I have a small amount of sympathy with new clause 3, but I do not think its proposals belong in this Bill</mark>"
1667,<mark> Member for Nottingham North Alex Norris for tabling amendment 2 to strengthen the accessibility requirements for blind and partially sighted voters</mark>
1668,<mark>1 This section sets out the purposes referred to in section 39</mark>
1669,<mark> 83E</mark>
1670,"<mark> When I had 3,000 respondents to a survey, 96% of them agreed with that</mark>"
1671,"<mark> Friend agree that this Bill is not really about updating electoral law It is about driving a bulldozer through the electoral processes of this country, demolishing our democracy, disenfranchising 6 million trade unionists, disenfranchising charities and vulnerable people, and moving them away from voting in this country, rather than towards democratic process</mark>"
1672,<mark> It reinserts a crossreference to the definition of qualifying Commonwealth citizen in section 79 of the Local Government Act 1972</mark>
1673,"<mark> On new clause 12 and related consequential amendments, it was always the policy intention for the enforcement of digital imprints to broadly mirror the enforcement of the print regime</mark>"
1674,<mark> Amendments 13 to 15 seek to futureproof the appointment mechanism of Ministers to the Speakers Committee on the Electoral Commission</mark>
1675,"<mark> As currently drafted, clause 15 enables a Minister of the Crown with responsibilities for the constitution appointed by the Prime Minister to deputise for the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, following the Transfer of Functions Secretary of State for Levelling  Up, Housing and Communities Order 2021</mark>"
1676,"<mark>With the leave of the House, we shall take motions 7, 8 and 9 together</mark>"
1677,"<mark> 83A7,</mark>"
1678,"<mark> Gentleman for raising this important issue, because fortifying nonwholemeal wheat flour with folic acid will help to prevent hundreds of neural tube defects in foetuses every year</mark>"
1679,"<mark> Home delivery capacity is now at 7 million lateral flow tests every day, with community pharmacies supplying an additional 9</mark>"
1680,<mark>5 million tests last week</mark>
1681,"<mark> This month, we will get another 750 million lateral flow devices into the UK for January and February</mark>"
1682,"<mark> We know that omicron numbers are still really high, and we still have more than 2,000 people hospitalised every day, so we do need to be cautious</mark>"
1683,"<mark> It is estimated that only a few hundred Christians live there today, but it is impossible to know the exact number because of the secrecy that they are forced into as a result of the divisive clan mentalities and vigilantism that pervade the country</mark>"
1684,"<mark> Friend agree that, as well as Government recognition, we should also recognise, as he has, the important contribution that Somalilanders have made to the development agenda The Governments decision to cut the aid budget from £121 million in 202021 to £71</mark>"
1685,"<mark>2 million this year is setting the nation back, so the Government need to reconsider that</mark>"
1686,<mark> Member for South Staffordshire referred to the election in 2003 when the presidency changed hands by 80 votes</mark>
1687,"<mark> In recognition of that, the council passed a resolution in 2014 adding its voice to the demands for independence</mark>"
1688,"<mark> In fact, in Cardiff they go back to the middle 1800s</mark>"
1689,<mark> There were mass killings of tens of thousands of Somali civilians</mark>
1690,"<mark> It was one of the few conflicts where fighter jets took off from cities in one area in order to bomb the cities that they had taken off from, indiscriminately killing thousands of civilians</mark>"
1691,"<mark> In those years of conflictwhere so many Somalilanders had their lives under threat, and so many hundreds of thousands were displaced, both internally within Somaliland and externallythat dream and that vision of creating their own homeland once again and reestablishing those old territorial borders burned bright, and that is what they were able to achieve in 1991</mark>"
1692,"<mark> Somaliland is not asking for a change to the boundaries, as they are very much what was there in 1960</mark>"
1693,"<mark> One need only look to the other side of Africa, at the confederation between Senegal and Gambia, which was unwound in the late 1980s</mark>"
1694,"<mark> DP World already invests in the port of Berbera, and the welcome investment from British International Investmentthe old Commonwealth Development Corporationamounts to hundreds of millions of pounds</mark>"
1695,"<mark> The Government recognise the importance of Somaliland, and we are willing to invest hundreds of millions of pounds there, because we realise that it opens up so much of the horn of Africa to British goods and investment</mark>"
1696,"<mark> Many steps have already been taken in municipal and devolved government to encourage the links between our great nations of the United Kingdom and Somaliland, but now is the time for the UK Government to take the leadfor the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office not to be shy, and not to think that policy is stuck in the 1960s</mark>"
1697,"<mark> In 1991, it emerged from years of subjugation to the regime in Mogadishufrom having so many citizens, including children, killed in cold bloodand it was able to establish its borders once more</mark>"
1698,"<mark> Friend the Member for Chelmsford Vicky Fordwould have been delighted to take part in the debate, but she is currently visiting east Africa, so it is my pleasure, as Minister for Europe and in post for less than a month, to respond on behalf of the Government</mark>"
1699,"<mark> By 2035, trade through there could support more than 50,000 jobs in Somaliland</mark>"
1700,"<mark> British International Investment, the UKs development finance body, is investing in the port with Dubai Ports World as part of a $1</mark>"
1701,<mark>72 billion investment into freeports in Africa</mark>
1702,"<mark> Through the Global Partnership for Education, the United Kingdom has supported the development of Somalilands College of Education and trained nearly 2,200 teachers</mark>"
1703,"<mark> In part, that reflects the complex and at times painful history that followed the brief independence, in June 1960, of what had been British Somaliland</mark>"
1704,"<mark>Amendment made 70, page 194, line 39, leave out Part 4 of and insert Schedule Special measures to</mark>"
1705,"<mark> Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen Royston Smith in this parliamentary year and the one before, we would not have got this far and, on behalf of 1 million leaseholders in all parts of England and Wales, may I say that we are grateful for their efforts Will they please keep going</mark>"
1706,"<mark>I would like to thank the Minister on behalf of a number of leaseholders around the country, because our amendments asked for only 25 years and the Government have gone further with 30 years</mark>"
1707,<mark> Gentleman will have seen that in the net zero strategy we have set out a plan for an extra £90 billion of investment from the private sector</mark>
1708,"<mark>The Defective Premises Act has been in effect since 1972, so there is a significant body of case law that those wishing to bring an action, and indeed the courts, will be able to refer to, to determine whether a premises is defective and therefore whether an action should be successful</mark>"
1709,"<mark> The new clause will be inserted into Part 5, after clause 137</mark>"
1710,<mark> The proposal to make developers pay £4 billion for cladding removal in buildings under 18 metres is unclear on how quickly developers will be asked to pay and what measures the Government will take if they refuse</mark>
1711,<mark> Does the Minister think it is right that social landlords have paid millions more than developers to fix the building safety scandal at the cost of delivering new social homes I hope that we will see urgent action to appease concerns raised by leaseholders and Members across the House and to allay genuine concerns that it is one rule for council and social landlords and another for the Governments developer friends</mark>
1712,"<mark>1 The power to make regulations under section 1316b is exercisable by statutory instrument, in the case of regulations made by the Secretary of State or the Welsh Ministers</mark>"
1713,<mark> Every single community is affected up and down the country; there are millions of leaseholders</mark>
1714,"<mark> In some ways, it does not really matter what our opinions are in this place; what matters is what we deliver for those millions of leaseholders up and down the country, so that they do not face bankrupting bills and huge mental health issues</mark>"
1715,<mark>1 The Architects Act 1997 is amended as follows</mark>
1716,"<mark> Friend is right a whole range of commitments were made, some of which will continue beyond the end of 2022</mark>"
1717,"<mark> As I said, a key commitment was for countries to revisit their emissionsreduction targets by the end of 2022</mark>"
1718,"<mark> House buyers need to have confidence in the safety and quality of their homes, which is why the Scottish Government support the principle of the new homes ombudsman scheme proposed in part 5 of the Bill</mark>"
1719,<mark> It is essential for part 5 to acknowledge and respect the devolution settlement</mark>
1720,"<mark> We are four and a half years on from Grenfell, and every single day that passes without the situation being resolved puts enormous strain on our constituents</mark>"
1721,"<mark>We have less than three quarters of an hour left, so I will have to impose an initial time limit of four minutes on BackBench speeches</mark>"
1722,"<mark> The management company, YY, is in the process of taking the leaseholders to a firsttier tribunal to award costs, adding a 5% commission</mark>"
1723,"<mark>I fully support Labours new clause 3 and if there is a vote on it, I will be supporting it, particularly as subsection 6 would protect the small buytolet landlords the right hon</mark>"
1724,"<mark> Gentleman knows, the scheme in Wales will be administered by the Welsh Government, so may I take it and inform my constituents that new clause 3 will be the basis of the scheme that we see apply to Wales, where Labour is in government</mark>"
1725,"<mark> Does he agree that there is a requirement to move with haste A constituent of mine who has contacted me is facing a bill of £25,000, with a demand for £5,000 by the end of this month, so the Government really need to move very quickly</mark>"
1726,"<mark> As well as providing for the establishment of a building works agency, which we believe remains necessary if the Government are to ensure that the pace of remediation across the country is accelerated and that works are properly carried out  and certified, our new clause 3 seeks to provide the maximum legal protection possible for leaseholders facing potential costs to fix historic cladding and noncladding defects, irrespective of circumstance</mark>"
1727,"<mark> Members for Stevenage and for Southampton, Itchen, does the same and we fully support it, as well as their new clauses 5 and 6</mark>"
1728,"<mark> We will seek to divide on new clause 3 today, simply to reinforce to the other place the importance we attach to the issue of leaseholder protection, but we do want to work constructively with the Government on this matter in the period ahead, in the light of the change of tone and approach signalled by the Secretary of State last week</mark>"
1729,"<mark> We are asking for the VAT to be scrapped, because when the Treasury puts forward £5 billion, £1 billion of it will be going back to the Treasury automatically; the frustration is understandable</mark>"
1730,"<mark> Another example we give is how a previous defects Actthe Defective Premises Act 1972could be used, as it was for properties with prefabricated concrete</mark>"
1731,"<mark> For example, I have a property in my constituency, Vista Towerone of the famous propertieswhere the remediation costs are £15 million for 73 flats</mark>"
1732,"<mark> The leaseholders paid £200,000 for their flats, and their remediation costs are £212,000, so hon</mark>"
1733,"<mark> The mortgage companies are losing money, and that was before the leaseholders got into paying over £300,000 for waking watch and all the other interim costs that have added to the bills</mark>"
1734,"<mark> For that particular property, with the announcement that the Secretary of State made, leaseholders costs went from £200,000 down to £60,000</mark>"
1735,"<mark> We are not there yet, but we are very close to getting there and supporting millions of constituents up and down the country</mark>"
1736,<mark> Lady is a doughty campaigner on behalf of her constituents in the Roundway and elsewhere</mark>
1737,<mark> The Bill Committee debated section 1 of the Defective Premises Act 1972 in significant detail; I recall that the hon</mark>
1738,<mark> Section 1 allows a claim for compensation to be brought through the civil courts when a dwelling was not fit for habitation on completion</mark>
1739,"<mark> At the moment, as I am sure the Minister knows, householders in some parts of the country cannot get any flood insurance if their property has been built after 2009</mark>"
1740,"<mark>3 million homes in the UK at risk of flooding, without any property flood resilience measures</mark>"
1741,"<mark> Without positive action from the Government, tens of thousands more homes will be built without the protection they need</mark>"
1742,"<mark> It was the result of two years of marathon work and a twoweek sprint of negotiations, following which the world can creditably say that we have kept within reach the goal of limiting global warming to 1</mark>"
1743,<mark>5 above preindustrial levels</mark>
1744,<mark> But to keep 1</mark>
1745,"<mark>5 alive, commitments must be translated into action</mark>"
1746,"<mark>As the Chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee knows, all countries have committed to come back to their 2030 emissionsreduction targets by 2022, if necessary</mark>"
1747,"<mark> Of course, the G20 is responsible for 80% of global emissions and will have to lead the way</mark>"
1748,"<mark> Does the COP President agree that the lesson is not that, as some in his party would say, we are moving too fast on green energy, but the opposite we are moving too slowly and our dependence on fossil fuels leaves us vulnerable The only way, therefore, to keep 1</mark>"
1749,<mark>5 alive and provide energy security is to go further and faster on the climate transition</mark>
1750,"<mark>Consumers looking at their energy bills will ask, If it is going so well, why are our bills rocketing and why are we so vulnerable We can keep 1</mark>"
1751,<mark>5 alive only if we have an energy policy that is fair at home and abroad</mark>
1752,"<mark> Many of the fossil fuel companies have made billions as a result of soaring prices, yet the Government say we should not tax them further because they are struggling</mark>"
1753,"<mark>Our young people have led the fight for tougher climate change pledges, so the world at least does not breach 1</mark>"
1754,<mark>5 of warming</mark>
1755,"<mark> To support their activism, Scotland recently hosted the UN Climate Change Conference of Youth ahead of COP26, has unveiled almost £1 million for a programme for young people in the climate conference and legacy activities, and has signed up to the UNICEF declaration on children, youth and climate change, along with countries such as Norway, the Netherlands and Peru</mark>"
1756,<mark>What progress he made at COP26 on ensuring the Paris Agreement temperature goal of limiting global warming to 1</mark>
1757,<mark>5 degrees Celsius remains achievable</mark>
1758,"<mark> Subsection 4 provides that where the time limit for bringing an action by virtue of section 1 of the Defective Premises Act 1972 would otherwise expire in the initial period, it expires at the end of that period</mark>"
1759,<mark> The new Schedule is intended to replace clauses 104 to 113 and be inserted after Schedule 6</mark>
1760,"<mark>That the draft Data Protection Act 2018 Amendment of Schedule 2 Exemptions Regulations 2022, which were laid before this House on 10 December 2021, be approved</mark>"
1761,"<mark> Normally it would be the Chairman of the Committee who would be speaking in this debate on behalf of the Committee, but the hon</mark>"
1762,"<mark> Dame Laura Cox, in her 2018 report on bullying and harassment of House staff, recommended that Members of Parliament should not be involved in adjudicating on their own colleagues accused of these very serious offences</mark>"
1763,"<mark>New clause 2 and amendment 1, which stand in my name and are kindly supported by the hon</mark>"
1764,"<mark> That is exactly what happened at Wessex Foods in Lowestoft 11 years ago, in July 2011</mark>"
1765,"<mark> I should therefore be grateful if the Minister gave serious consideration to accepting new clause 2 and amendment 1, so that the Building Act can be amended to provide for the protection of property</mark>"
1766,"<mark> They are a silent killer and claim the lives of over 700 people every year, as well as thousands more who suffer injuries and lose their independence</mark>"
1767,<mark> A British standard already exists that reduces falls by a staggering 60% British Standard 53951</mark>
1768,"<mark> The Government will argue that our focus should be outcomebased rather  than legislating on method, but I might point to regulation 7 of the building regulations, on combustible materials, which is in itself descriptive and sets out how the industry must achieve that particular regulation</mark>"
1769,"<mark> If the outcome that we are all aiming for is safety of stairs, then the status quo is simply not working, and hundreds of people are dying every year from something that could so easily be prevented I refer back to the 60% figure</mark>"
1770,"<mark>I rise to speak in support of new clauses 1, 2, 15, 16 and 23</mark>"
1771,"<mark> Friend the Member for Sheffield South East Mr Betts,  and amendment 1, tabled by the hon</mark>"
1772,"<mark> As he will no doubt be aware, concerns were raised that the plans for Ballymores proposed 51storey development in Cuba Street in my constituency included only a single fire escape for a building that would have been two and half times the height of Grenfell tower</mark>"
1773,"<mark> Not only landlords of highrise blocks but social landlords and resident leaseholders need to do this, and the cost is estimated to be about £30 a year per flat</mark>"
1774,"<mark> Less than a year before Grenfell, in August 2016, there was a very serious fire, less than 1 mile from where Grenfell Tower stands, at Shepherds Courtan 18storey blockin my constituency</mark>"
1775,<mark> Some 5</mark>
1776,"<mark>5 million of that particular type of faulty washerdryer were manufactured, and hundreds if not thousands of fires across the country, some obviously in highrise buildings, have been caused by that</mark>"
1777,"<mark> Indeed, over half53%of all accidental dwelling fires are caused by electrical sources of ignition</mark>"
1778,"<mark> I will first deal briefly with several of the nonGovernment amendments selected, before taking the opportunity to ask the Minister several specific questions relating to  Government new clause 19, new schedule 1 and various other amendments relating to special measures and protections against forfeiture</mark>"
1779,<mark> This directly relates to our previous debate on part 5</mark>
1780,"<mark> No provisions prohibiting forfeiture would be necessary if the House had accepted any amendment, whether it be new clause 3, new clause 13 or potential forthcoming Government amendments, that provides sufficiently robust legal protection for leaseholders in all circumstances</mark>"
1781,<mark> Proposed new paragraph 9 is a new provision that provides for a financial management proposal</mark>
1782,"<mark> 11, 12, 16 to 28, 31 and 32, 36, 40, 61, 63 and 70are consequential amendments that make changes relating to special measures due to the provisions now appearing in new schedule 1</mark>"
1783,"<mark> Four technical amendments are consequential to amendment 1, which I introduced earlier, relating to the new homes ombudsman</mark>"
1784,"<mark> Amendments 66 and 67 adjust the territorial extent of the provisions about the new homes ombudsman scheme now that that the scheme will operate across Great Britain, and territorial extent issues are also dealt with in new schedule 2, which contains a consequential amendment related to the new homes ombudsman</mark>"
1785,"<mark> Amendment 64 provides that the consequential amendments in schedule 5 relating to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967an Act we all know welland the Freedom of Information Act 2000 extend to all of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland</mark>"
1786,<mark> That left them facing bills for tens of thousands of pounds</mark>
1787,<mark> We know that is a problem in hundreds of buildings</mark>
1788,"<mark>It is nearly five years since the tragic events at Grenfell Tower, yet thousands of my constituents in Salford and Eccles still live in fear</mark>"
1789,<mark> Prospective suppliers bidding for contracts above £5 million a year must now have committed to the Governments target of net zero by 2050 and have published a carbon reduction plan</mark>
1790,"<mark> Certainly, the provision of funds for cladding removal, the initial move on the ACM cladding, the £1 billion and the extension of the building safety fund to £5 billion have all been welcome</mark>"
1791,"<mark> They were horrified to be told that FirstPort intends to recover the estimated £4,912,000 for repairs from the leaseholders if the application to the building safety fund is not successful</mark>"
1792,"<mark> That will mean that constituents such as the single working mother who paid £60,000 for a 25% share of her property will be lumbered with a repair bill of £110,000</mark>"
1793,"<mark> I have more than 1,000 constituents living in dangerous homes</mark>"
1794,<mark> It is time to enact in practice provisions that the House of Commons passed in lawineffectivelyin 2002</mark>
1795,"<mark> Will he support me in asking the Government to get together with the technical sides of the insurance companies and the Competition and Markets Authority to get those insurance premiums back down to what they were before so that leaseholders may pay £300 a year to insure a building they do not own rather than £3,000 a year</mark>"
1796,"<mark> That has been the case since August 2016 when there was a very serious fire at Shepherds Court in my constituency, which I spoke about earlier today</mark>"
1797,"<mark> We have now had a recent announcement from the new Secretary of StateI hope I have understood this correctlythat there will be a request to private developers to provide £4 billion, with a veiled threat of enforcing that in some as yet unspecified way, in order to deal with buildings between 11 and 18 metres</mark>"
1798,<mark>I start by paying tribute to the many hundreds of Vauxhall residents who have contacted me in my short two years as Member of Parliament for Vauxhall</mark>
1799,"<mark> At every stage of my continued efforts on behalf of Vauxhall leaseholders going through that anguish and uncertainty over the last two years, the Bill has been held up by the Government as the solution that would finally bring an end to this crisis</mark>"
1800,<mark> Where does that leave the millions of leaseholders caught up at various points along the way of that lengthy scandal What does the Bill do to empower leaseholders who had their assessment before the recent changes in Government policy and believe that unnecessary work has been recommended for their building Where is the help for leaseholders whose flats are unsellable until that remediation work is complete but who have been told that they will have to wait many years They are trapped</mark>
1801,"<mark> As I suggested on Report, it is not preempting the Grenfell Tower inquirys conclusions to state that the horror of that dreadful June night in 2017 was the product not only of pernicious industry practice but of state failure a failure that involved successive Governments presiding over a deficient regulatory regime, and a failure to act on repeated and clear warnings about the potentially lethal consequences of that fact</mark>"
1802,"<mark> When we started our campaign about 18 months ago, the Governments original offer was around £20 million to deal with these issues</mark>"
1803,"<mark> After the statement from the Secretary of State last week, we are now on course to have more than £9 billion of Government support, with probably another £100 million for waking watch, alarms and a variety of other issues</mark>"
1804,"<mark> Tonight, millions of leaseholders up and down the country, many with huge mental health issues and facing massive financial ruin, have hope</mark>"
1805,<mark> That hope encourages us to believe that we may finally come to a position where we can resolve things for those millions of leaseholders</mark>
1806,"<mark> At Vista Tower in my constituency, which has more than £15 millionworth of remediation costs, the fire breaks are missing</mark>"
1807,"<mark> With all the technical details, that campaign has demonstrated how complicated this issue is and the many millions of people and tens of thousands of buildings it affects in many different ways</mark>"
1808,"<mark> Will the Government be prepared to provide support so that those leaseholders can take action against the original developers, or will the Government take the action on their behalf, because a lot of these leaseholders have been going through this for a number of years and no longer have the mental resilience or ability to take these fights on and take legal actions for the next five or 10 years in the courts Will the Minister provide further support to those leaseholders Will he agree to continue to meet and work with me so that we can ensure that leaseholders are not held responsible and they are the innocent parties throughout this crisis</mark>"
1809,"<mark> In a modern liberal democracy, living in a home where you feel safe should be a basic human right, but sadly, for thousands of people up and down our country, this most reasonable of expectations does not tally with their current experience</mark>"
1810,"<mark> This Bill is going to right that wrong by replacing an outdated building system with one that is attuned not just to where we are in 2021 but to how we protect people in 2031, 2041 and for many years beyond</mark>"
1811,<mark> Member for Vauxhall Florence Eshalomi; and many others who have worked so very hard to on behalf of their constituents to make sure that their concerns are addressed</mark>
1812,"<mark>I shall speak to Opposition new clause 3 and to the amendments that, although they will not be pressed to a vote this evening, would protect leaseholders from the costs of not only cladding removal, but the remediation of noncladding defects</mark>"
1813,"<mark> It seems to me that someone who has profited from, for example, charging a building in my constituency an insurance premium of £700,000 in total, which has never come down, has some big questions to answer</mark>"
1814,"<mark> First, around half of the buildings in my constituency that have difficulties associated with them have noncladdingrelated problems</mark>"
1815,"<mark> Indeed, in Queens Wharf in Reading town centre, the building owners estimate that nearly £1 million of work needs to be carried out</mark>"
1816,"<mark>The principle that leaseholders should not have to pay for issues that are not their responsibility, as they bought properties in good faith, was first established in the Select Committee report in July 2018</mark>"
1817,<mark> Members who have been here long enough will remember that I took the Mesothelioma Act 2014 through this House</mark>
1818,"<mark> Originally, we gave the victims 80% of the compensation that they would have got through the courts</mark>"
1819,"<mark> Eventually, we gave them 100%</mark>"
1820,"<mark> When we come to part 5, Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope to catch your eye again</mark>"
1821,<mark> This new clause amends Part XVI of the Housing Act 1985 originally enacted as the Housing Defects Act 1984 to empower the government and local authorities to designate dwellings with cladding and fire safety defects as defective and to provide grant support for remediation</mark>
1822,<mark> It places a timelimited duty on the Secretary of State to consider making designations under Part XVI of the Housing Act 1985 to provide funding for cladding and fire safety remediation and for Parliament to approve the plans for doing so</mark>
1823,<mark> Removing subsection 5 removes the material risk a court may construe clause 128 in a way that means it has no practical benefit and will lead to years of costly litigation for leaseholders</mark>
1824,"<mark> This is the first group of amendments, new clauses and new schedules that relates to part 5 of the Bill</mark>"
1825,<mark> Members should not make general speeches about how they feel about the Bill at this point; this part of the proceedings very specifically relates to part 5</mark>
1826,"<mark> Gentleman, suggest to the Government that between now and the House of Lords they consider taking a right to take the potential claims by the landlords on behalf of leaseholders into a public agency which can make a public claim against the developers, builders, architects, surveyors, building specification and building controllers, so that money can be brought back from those who were responsible, not the innocent leaseholders who are not</mark>"
1827,"<mark> I have no intention of seeking to reprise them this afternoon, but before I turn to part 5 of the Bill and the consideration of the amendments related to it, I feel it is incumbent on me briefly to restate why we believe this legislation is so important</mark>"
1828,"<mark> To the extent that the Bill delivers on the recommendations of Dame Judiths report, we remain supportive of it and want to see a version of it on the statute book as soon as possible, given that four and a half years have elapsed since the Grenfell tragedy; however, the House knows we have serious concerns about what is missing from the Bill, and particularly its failure as drafted to provide robust legal protection for leaseholders facing ruinous costsa point already made by several hon</mark>"
1829,"<mark> The Minister should note that, with some minor tweaks, our new clause 3 would achieve that</mark>"
1830,"<mark> In fairness to the Government and the Minister, we now have over £9 billion of Government support put forward with other funds on top, so it would be churlish of us, with the very technical amendments I am going to speak to shortly, to try to hold the Government to these specific issues</mark>"
1831,<mark> New clause 21 makes sure that the devolved Administrations are not restricted from bringing forward legislation to alter the ombudsmans statutory functions in relation to that territorys future by disapplying a restriction in the Government of Wales Act 2006</mark>
1832,"<mark> That is why we have proposed adding section 4B4 to the Limitation Act 1980 through clause 128, which will ensure that there is always a minimum amount of time to lodge a claim under section 1 of the Defective Premises Act for buildings whose limitation periods will be revived for a very short period of time</mark>"
1833,"<mark> That means that those in any buildings completed between mid1992 and mid1993 will always have one full year in which to lodge their claim, once this Bill and its provisions apply</mark>"
1834,"<mark> Friend the Member for Worthing West Sir Peter Bottomley, referred to the Defective Premises Act 1972</mark>"
1835,"<mark> I would say to him that quite apart from the body of case law that exists with respect to the 1972 Act, and quite apart from the fact that even if a company has become defunct directors can still be held liable for the decisions made, as it were, on their watch, the challenges that he has described are the sorts of things that we will want to discuss in this place and in the other place, across parties, to ensure that such challenges are addressed</mark>"
1836,<mark> That means that the EU will now have a 25% price advantage over UK steel and aluminium exports to the US</mark>
1837,"<mark>At the start of last month, I wrote to the Secretary of State about those steel tariffs, which have been in place since 2018 and have already done great damage</mark>"
1838,"<mark> In 2017, exports of steel and aluminium to the United States were more than 350,000 tonnes</mark>"
1839,"<mark> The UK accounts for less than 1% of US steel and aluminium imports in volume terms, so UK imports do not affect the viability or the national security of the US steel or aluminium industries</mark>"
1840,"<mark> It supplies thousands of subframes every day to motor  manufacturers worldwide, but it has outlined to me concerns that have been raised with it by European companies about the rules of origin and potential tariffs on goods supplied from the UK</mark>"
1841,"<mark>In her answer to the urgent question, the Minister mentioned the £286 million of aid that we are giving to Afghanistan</mark>"
1842,"<mark> The amount has been doubled after being halved the previous year, which is fine, but in her response to another urgent question last week, the Minister confirmed that only half that money£145 millionhad actually been disbursed</mark>"
1843,"<mark>In addition to British Council staff, many of us have thousands of constituentsin my case, up to 150who have relatives and friends who have worked for the British in Afghanistan and who are in terrible need of resettlement to this country</mark>"
1844,"<mark> That included over 8,000 British nationals, and close to 5,000 Afghans who loyally served the UKincluding British Council employeesalong with their dependants</mark>"
1845,"<mark> We are coordinating closely with international partners, and have doubled our aid to Afghanistan for this financial year to £286 million, which will be used to provide the vital humanitarian assistance that will save lives this winter</mark>"
1846,"<mark> As I set out earlier, we have doubled our aid for Afghanistan for this financial year to £286 million, which will be essential to providing humanitarian assistance for those most in need</mark>"
1847,"<mark> The Government have already evacuated thousands of women and girlsfor instance, female judges, womens rights activists and a girls football team</mark>"
1848,"<mark> We have doubled the aid for this financial year to £286 million, which will be used to ensure that we get that humanitarian assistance to those on the ground</mark>"
1849,<mark> More than 20 million people are facing the prospect of starvation in Afghanistan and the situation could not be more urgent</mark>
1850,"<mark> In relation to the Ministers earlier responses, could she tell the House how much of the £286 million of aid promised in this financial year has been disbursed so far</mark>"
1851,"<mark>For every £490 of Brexit damage, CPTPP should recover about £8 of it, but that is at risk if the UK patent attorneys membership of the European Patent Organisation is undermined or removed</mark>"
1852,<mark> He is right it is an £8</mark>
1853,<mark>4 trillion market that we are opening up</mark>
1854,"<mark> Friend is absolutely right; the pay for people working in those sectors is about 50% higher than the UK average, so the more jobs we can create in those growth sectors, the better</mark>"
1855,"<mark>9% of the businesses in his constituency that export will benefit from CPTPP, and I look forward to the day when he welcomes that</mark>"
1856,<mark> Friend the Member for Darlington Peter Gibson on the successful passage of his Bill a halfhour or so ago</mark>
1857,"<mark> I fervently hope that  in half an hours time, I will be offering the same congratulations to my hon</mark>"
1858,"<mark> Friend said in his speech today, 80% of crime that involves cautions or convictions involves repeat offences</mark>"
1859,"<mark> Good intentions and strategies need to be backed up by Government investment, and nearly £900 million of additional funding is being put in over the next three years, which brings the total up to £3 billion</mark>"
1860,"<mark> With more than 2,000 bed spaces, it is important for there to be a comprehensive drugs strategy for the approved premises estate</mark>"
1861,"<mark> Members may be aware, around 80% of crime that receives a caution or conviction is committed by a repeat offender</mark>"
1862,"<mark> Indeed, Dame Carol Blacks review of drugs estimated that the total cost of harms related to illicit drug use in England was more than £19 billion in 201718</mark>"
1863,"<mark> Drugrelated crime was the main driver of the total costs, with recorded offences committed in England by drug users amounting to £9</mark>"
1864,<mark>3 billion in that period</mark>
1865,"<mark> HMPPS estimates that when it implements the change in testing, it will cost approximately £1</mark>"
1866,<mark>2 million per year to carry out the enhanced testing regime with residents of approved premises</mark>
1867,"<mark> The current annual budget for drug testing in approved premises is £350,000, so the implementation of this Bill would see an increase of some £850,000</mark>"
1868,"<mark> However, it is worth bearing it in mind that the Ministry of Justice has indicated that it has evidence that shows that drug treatment provides a return to society of £4 for every £1 that is invested, and that increases to a return to society of £21 over a period of 10 years</mark>"
1869,"<mark> Let us look at what the Mayor of London is doing an extra 1,300 police officers and £70 million for opportunities for disadvantaged young people</mark>"
1870,"<mark> The reoffending rate for people using the London Womens Diversion Service, which the Mayor of London funds, is just 7% versus the national average of, I think, 23</mark>"
1871,<mark>3%</mark>
1872,"<mark> Following over a decade of Tory Government, drug use in prisons has increased by 500%</mark>"
1873,"<mark> There has been a 12% drop in inmates enrolling in drug and alcohol courses over the last four years, with fewer offenders taking these programmes</mark>"
1874,<mark> And what of the Justice Secretarys flagship programme of introducing £1 million Xray scanners in all mens prisons They are detecting only a quarter of the number of contraband items being found in manual checks by prison officers</mark>
1875,"<mark> The perilous state of our prisons means that a third of adults released  from custody go on to reoffend within a year, costing the taxpayer £18 billion and meaning that we are less safe on our streets</mark>"
1876,"<mark> Under clause 1 of the Bill, approved premises managers can authorised assisted premises staff to ask for and require a urine sample from any resident, rather than an oral fluid testa provision already in place elsewhere in the system</mark>"
1877,<mark> I was glad to hear reassurances during the Bill Committee that clause 1 also ensures that the first step will be to provide guidance and assistance for those found to have drugs or other illicit substances in their bodies</mark>
1878,"<mark> It builds on the recommendations of the prisons and probation ombudsman, which in 2017 called for more effective drug testing practices and better staff guidance to identify and address the risks associated with substance misuse</mark>"
1879,<mark> The strategy is underpinned with total investment of £3 billion in combating drugs over the next three years</mark>
1880,<mark> A recent internal survey of approved premises staff found that more than 50% of them felt that prescription medication was a problem</mark>
1881,"<mark> Without exaggeration, I counted, they can go off every 10 minutes between 6 pm and midnight</mark>"
1882,<mark> Sometimes at 1 am</mark>
1883,<mark> 1011WH</mark>
1884,"<mark> A fixed penalty charge notice just does not cut it as a deterrent or a punishment when fireworks can often cost many hundreds of pounds, and it does not reflect the negative impact on our communities</mark>"
1885,<mark> Limiting the noise to 90 dB and reviewing who can sell and use fireworks will go a long way to solving the issues faced by residents in Luton North and thousands of other people across the country</mark>
1886,"<mark> Could this new power fall foul of article 8 of the European convention on human rights, and if so, what would be the consequences of this</mark>"
1887,"<mark> Friend the Member for NewcastleunderLyme Aaron Bell who stewarded the Prisons Substance Testing Act 2021 through the House on behalf of Dame Cheryl Gillan, when it was in fact my hon</mark>"
1888,<mark> A Formula 1 race typically reaches 140 dB</mark>
1889,"<mark> We have already allocated £976 million of funding from the building safety fund, and will open the next phase early this year</mark>"
1890,<mark> We will also be providing an additional £3</mark>
1891,<mark>5 billion to cover the cost of addressing fire safety risks caused by unsafe cladding on all eligible buildings</mark>
1892,<mark> A further £27 million is being allocated to bring the misuse of waking watches to an end</mark>
1893,"<mark> That is on top of the current £35 million fund, which is already being used for 323 buildings and nearly 25,000 leasehold homes</mark>"
1894,"<mark> We estimate that that fund will save leaseholders an average of £163 each month, and we expect to open the expanded fund very shortly</mark>"
1895,<mark> Friend the Secretary of State will introduce an amendment to  the Building Safety Bill to extend the right of homeowners to challenge defects under the Defective Premises Act 1972 in homes that are up to 30 years old</mark>
1896,"<mark>5 million of funding approved for ACM and nonACM cladding remediation, and works are in progress, with ACM cladding expected to be removed by the end of April this year</mark>"
1897,"<mark> Remediation has been completed for 1, 3, 5 and 7 Eastfields Avenue</mark>"
1898,"<mark> For Coptain House and Mandel House, £6</mark>"
1899,<mark>9 million of funding has been approved for nonACM cladding remediation</mark>
1900,"<mark> For 5D Enterprise Way, £1</mark>"
1901,<mark>5 million of funding has been approved for nonACM cladding remediation</mark>
1902,"<mark> The buildings at 2, 6 and 8 Hardwicks Square are eligible for funding under the building safety fund and pretender support has been paid to facilitate the appointment of a project team for them</mark>"
1903,"<mark> In December, Lord Greenhalgh and officials met the National Housing Federation and Optivo, which has committed to reviewing all remediation requirements following the withdrawal of the consolidated advice note and the publication of PAS9980 last week</mark>"
1904,"<mark> And you are asked to stump up £50,000 or more to get it fixed</mark>"
1905,"<mark> I had hoped I could use the capital from my flat I own 25%, Notting Hill Genesis own 75% to either fund future hospice care or transfer to sheltered housing However, I am unable to sell this flat, and am pretty much trapped here</mark>"
1906,"<mark> Unsafe cladding was discovered, following an EWS1 assessment in 2018, in which it scored a B2 rating</mark>"
1907,"<mark> They are paying for waking watch to the tune of £45,000 a month and have had an eyewatering 500% insurance hike</mark>"
1908,<mark> Yet residents have been told they face costs of around £1 million for remediation works</mark>
1909,"<mark> To give perspective, in two years that fund has only funded 18 out of the 1,000 buildings that need workthat is 1</mark>"
1910,<mark>8%</mark>
1911,"<mark> But at the exact same time, we saw the UK gain a record number of billionaires, and it now stands at 171</mark>"
1912,"<mark> Those billionaires do not have to worry about spending money on food or fuel, about how they will afford rent, or about losing their jobs</mark>"
1913,<mark> I was inundated with correspondence from constituents  when the Government made the horrific decision to cut universal credit by £20 a week</mark>
1914,"<mark> They are expensive to run, and his running costs are over £60 a week</mark>"
1915,"<mark> By comparison, according to Usave, the average cost for heating a onebed flat is about £29 a month</mark>"
1916,"<mark> One option to tackle fuel poverty could be reducing VAT on energy bills, which would save about £90 per customer and is backed by some in the industry</mark>"
1917,"<mark>3 billion in fraudulently claimed covid business funding, which has today caused Lord Agnew to resign at the Dispatch Box, is a very different approach from that taken by the DWP when it makes mistakes resulting in overpayments, which causes huge hardship to those affected</mark>"
1918,<mark> Consumer prices were 5</mark>
1919,<mark>4% higher in December 2021 than the year before</mark>
1920,"<mark> It is the highest inflation rate recorded since 1992, and it is forecast to carry on rising</mark>"
1921,"<mark> Domestic gas prices increased by 28% between January and November last year, and electricity by 19%</mark>"
1922,<mark> Headline figures say that food prices increased by 4</mark>
1923,"<mark>2% in the year to December, but she looked further</mark>"
1924,"<mark> Since this time last year, the cheapest pasta in her local supermarket went up by 141%</mark>"
1925,"<mark> Similarly, rice is up by 344%</mark>"
1926,"<mark>8 million women born in the 1950s who were cruelly robbed of their pensions by the Government, who are still being unfairly denied full restitution for their loss and who continue to suffer an appalling injustice</mark>"
1927,"<mark> I also mention the 3 million people, mainly selfemployed and directors of small limited companies, whom the Chancellor callously excluded from any financial support during a pandemic</mark>"
1928,"<mark> I also urge the Government to take steps to reduce those levels of poverty and spiralling debt in the rest of the United Kingdom by introducing measures such as we have in Scotland, including the gamechanging £20 child payment, the 1,140 hours of free childcare a year for eligible children, free prescriptions, free sanitary products for women and girls, free bus travel across the country for everyone over 60 and the disabledbriefly expanded to include young people between the ages of five and 21 and free university tuition in our worldclass universities for our young people</mark>"
1929,"<mark> Spending could be stopped on vanity projects, including the new royal yacht, or on the refurbishment of Buckingham Palace, estimated at £360 million</mark>"
1930,<mark> There was also the shambolic process that resulted in the loss of £4</mark>
1931,<mark>3 billion to fraud during the pandemic being written off by the Chancellor</mark>
1932,"<mark> While inflated Tory egos jockey for position in a power struggle for the worst of possible reasons, the cost of realworld inflation is being felt across these islands as millions struggle to fund the power they need to heat their homes</mark>"
1933,"<mark> What a dismal situation it is where more than one in three Scots are already in crisis with energy costs soaring by up to 28%, but there are more price hikes and more pain still to come</mark>"
1934,"<mark> Since 2014, the cost of the Union has been to rip Scotland from Europe against our democratic will, damaging our freedoms, impacting our economy and driving European friends away from their homes</mark>"
1935,"<mark> We have suffered the bedroom tax, the benefit cap, the rape clause, universal credit cuts, and Ministers acting unlawfully, while obscene billions of pounds have been lost or written off on covid contracts and schemes</mark>"
1936,"<mark>The House divided Ayes 57, Noes 0</mark>"
1937,"<mark> We have heard a great deal about oil and gas imports, and it is true that 87% of the price cap increase is due to increased gas prices, with the remainder due to supplier failure</mark>"
1938,"<mark> Inflation, reflecting the confluence of factors at play in the crisis, is running at 5</mark>"
1939,<mark>4%the highest it has been in nearly 30 years</mark>
1940,"<mark> Indeed, in Wales as a whole about 80% of people have to commute by car</mark>"
1941,<mark> At the autumn Budget I called on the Chancellor to make a £3</mark>
1942,"<mark>6 billion investment over 10 years, in conjunction with the Welsh Government and the private sector, to improve home insulation in Wales</mark>"
1943,"<mark> A report by the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales has suggested that with such a package of investment over 10 years we would be able to end fuel poverty in Wales, producing average annual savings of £418</mark>"
1944,"<mark>Given the increases in energy costs, can the Chief Secretary tell us how much extra VAT the Treasury is taking, what extra oil and gas revenues are coming in and how much extra is coming in from the increased price of petrol at the pumps Why are the Government not using that money to mitigate costs for the 6 million households that will be plunged into fuel poverty when the cap rise kicks in in April</mark>"
1945,"<mark> Member is on the action of the Scottish Government, I presume he is going to commend them for bringing forward the £20 a week child payment as one way to help to mitigate the poverty being imposed by Westminster</mark>"
1946,"<mark> In which case, why did Labour vote for the Nuclear Energy Financing Bill, the impact statement for which said that it could add up to £63 billion to household energy bills How on earth is that helping people with the energy crisis</mark>"
1947,"<mark> Tinkering at the edges, such as delaying the impact of the £2 billion administration costs of 28 energy companies going bust, is not enough</mark>"
1948,"<mark> In UK Government policy, the Tories have already made matters worse for those who are strugglinga cut in pensions of more than £500 per year, the removal of the £20 a week universal credit upliftand that in the midst of the cost of living crisis, with inflation at a 30year high and household incomes dropping in real terms by up to £1,200</mark>"
1949,<mark>7 billion for the development of Sizewell C</mark>
1950,"<mark> In their own impact assessment, they estimated costs of as much as £63 billion being added to our energy bills</mark>"
1951,"<mark> Worse, many customers are on what are called restricted meters, so they pay about £400 more per annum for their energy, due to a 4p surcharge per unit of electricity</mark>"
1952,"<mark> As for the North sea, the November Budget confirmed that this year alone the Treasury would receive an extra £1</mark>"
1953,"<mark>1 billion in oil and gas revenues, or £6 billion over the lifetime of the Parliament</mark>"
1954,"<mark> It is astounding that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury does not seem to understand that 5% of £2,000 is twice the value to the Treasury as 5% of £1,000</mark>"
1955,"<mark> The Scottish Governments child winter heating assistance supports 14,000 families with disabled children through automatic payments of £200 a year</mark>"
1956,"<mark> The low income winter heating assistance will help 400,000 lowincome households with £50 every winter, instead of complicated cold weather payments of £25</mark>"
1957,<mark> For families there is a gamechanging £20 per week child payment; compare this with the hapless £20 a week universal credit cut</mark>
1958,"<mark> If that decision has to be made by one person, that is one person too many, but, under this Government, millions of people are having to make that decision</mark>"
1959,<mark> Energy bills are to rise by 40%on average by £700 per householdshortly</mark>
1960,"<mark> The Chancellor is planning the largest tax hike in living memory, taking the tax burden on working people to its highest since 1950</mark>"
1961,"<mark> In the past year, Citizens Advice Scotland has seen a 38% increase in the number of people coming to it for advice about  being unable to pay their mortgage</mark>"
1962,<mark> Polling conducted on behalf of the same organisation found half a million Scots cutting back on their food spending in order to pay their energy bills this winterbefore those huge rises</mark>
1963,"<mark> The food blogger, Jack Monroe, who rose to fame with recipes showing how to cook family meals for less than £10 a week, highlighted that on social media over the weekend</mark>"
1964,"<mark> They gave examples of the cost of the cheapest pasta in the local supermarket rising by 141% in the past year, the cost of the cheapest bag of rice rising 344% and the cost of baked beans rising 45% year on year</mark>"
1965,"<mark> In the UK in 2022, nobody should have to choose between heating and eating</mark>"
1966,<mark> Let us remember that they voted to cut the £20 a week universal credit uplift for the poorest in this country and refused to feed school kids in the holidays</mark>

1969,"<mark> Indeed, we campaigned for the £20 child payment for some time in the Scottish Parliament and were delighted that the Scottish Government eventually introduced it</mark>"
1970,"<mark> However, it is a key, targeted intervention that helps to address child poverty, so what we would like nowall the Scottish charities are saying thisis for it to be doubled to £40 a week</mark>"
1971,"<mark> Young children and families in Scotland might be wondering why the Scottish Government will not listen to charities or, indeed, to Scottish Labours policy and increase the Scottish child payment to £40 a  week</mark>"
1972,<mark> The underwriting of the Gupta organisation puts half a billion pounds on to the taxpayer of Scotland</mark>
1973,"<mark> In 2016, we agreed on a crossparty basis to the devolution of a whole host of welfare powers to the Scottish Parliament</mark>"
1974,"<mark> In fact, they will take until 2025 to take full control of the devolved powers</mark>"
1975,"<mark> The newly announced Scotland projects could generate billions of pounds of economic activity in Scotland, so every single job created should be in Scotland, with fabrication plants, British Steel and others</mark>"
1976,"<mark> They could  bring in a motion now to sort out this problem, with fully funded measures to reduce the expected price rise in peoples energy bills in April through a VAT cut on home energy bills that would save most households £200 or more, and targeted extra support for the squeezed middle, pensioners and the lowest earners, who would receive £600 off their bills, paid for by a oneoff windfall tax on the North sea oil and gas producers who have profited from the price rises</mark>"
1977,"<mark> Under Labours plan, every household in Scotland would save more than £180 off their energy bills, and 800,000 households in Scotland struggling with the cost of living would get an extra £400 in additional support</mark>"
1978,<mark> That is nearly £600 for those hardest hit by the energy price risescritical money into the pockets of hardpressed Scots now</mark>
1979,"<mark> To go to work, if they are in a noncompliant vehicle, they will have to pay £10 a day, which will be devastating, while lorry drivers will have to pay £60 a day</mark>"
1980,"<mark> Any lorry driver who wants to have his or her breakfast in that caf will have to pay a £60 congestion charge, which is ludicrous</mark>"
1981,"<mark> That hardship fund has not been defined, but estimates of the funding required are in the region of £2</mark>"

1984,"<mark> Member for Glasgow East David Linden, who led the debate, is a passionate campaigner for combating poverty in his constituency and around the country, and I know how hard he works on behalf of his constituents to alleviate the burden that so many people find themselves under across this country</mark>"
1985,"<mark> Maybe they are laughing at the SNPs growth commission, which said that creating a separate state in Scotland would cost £450 million</mark>"
1986,"<mark> It also says that £5 billion would be  paid to the rest of the United Kingdom annually to account for its share in the national debt, while public spendingdespite what the hon</mark>"
1987,<mark> Member for Glasgow East would like to do to combat child poverty and poverty across the boardwould have to be capped at 1% less than annual GDP growth</mark>
1988,"<mark> Indeed, if Rishis slick Instagram graphics could be used as a currency, we would probably all be millionaires, just like the Chancellor himself</mark>"
1989,<mark> Inflation is rising at a frighteningly rapid pace this month it rose to 5</mark>
1990,"<mark>4%, the highest in almost 30 years, since March 1992, when it was 7</mark>"
1991,<mark>1%</mark>
1992,<mark> But we have not reached the summit yet Paul Dales of Capital Economics has said that inflation is now expected to hit 7% by April</mark>

1998,<mark> National Energy Action estimates that there are already 4</mark>
1999,"<mark>5 million fuelpoor households in the UK, which is nothing short of a disgrace, and if the cap rises, as is predicted, the number will rise to 6 million</mark>"
2000,"<mark> When I met with Age UK and Age Scotland after their snap survey, it was revealed that 96% of their respondents were worried about their energy bills</mark>"
2001,"<mark> In the last year alone, the British Government cut the £20 a week uplift to universal credit</mark>"
2002,"<mark> Indeed, they refused to extend the £20 uplift to the 2</mark>"
2003,<mark>5 million disabled people on legacy benefits</mark>
2004,<mark> Let me be especially clear to the Government that a proliferation of foodbanks is not a sign of the big society; it is a sign of bad policy from people who think that spending £840 on a roll of wallpaper is somehow normal</mark>
2005,"<mark> We want the Chancellor to launch a multibillionpound Brexit recovery fund to mitigate the worst, and growing, costs of Brexit</mark>"
2006,<mark> We need the April benefits uprating to better reflect inflation rates and to reinstate the £20 a week uplift to universal credit which so many of our constituents described as a lifeline</mark>
2007,"<mark> However, the constitutional reality is that, with limited taxraising powers, no borrowing powers and 85% of welfare spending still controlled in this place, those policies can only go so far when they are continually undermined by Tories and Tory Governments whom Scotland did not elect</mark>"
2008,"<mark> They say that a week is a long time in politics, and yes, for Westminster watchers and the chattering classes, defections, letters to the 1922 committee, Tea Room gossip and fizz with Liz are probably all very exciting, but for most of us, it just feels like groundhog day</mark>"
2009,"<mark> Of course, part of the reason they can take these socalled big decisions is that they have the ability to borrow; he just talked about £600 billion</mark>"
2010,<mark> Member will know that the regressive tax hike in national insurance will take away 20% of the pay increase for a band 5 nurse in Scotland</mark>
2011,"<mark> Given that the House has just voted by a clear majority for a motion calling for the Government to reinstate the £20 universal credit uplift, introduce a real living wage of at least £10 an hour and an energy payment for lowincome households, and roll out a child payment similar to that in Scotlandgiven that the Parliament that has been given all this control has just voted for thatcan you inform me when the Government will introduce such measures to help people with the cost of living crisis</mark>"
2012,<mark> With around 1</mark>
2013,"<mark>25 million vacancies across the UK, up 33,000, or 2</mark>"
2014,"<mark>7% in a month, and by 467,000, or 58</mark>"
2015,"<mark>9% since the start of the pandemic, there are many further opportunities for people to move into and, importantly, progress in work and increase their earnings</mark>"
2016,"<mark> As well as getting people into jobs, we are taking action to boost the takehome pay of lowincome working households by giving 2 million families an extra £1,000 a year through our cut to the universal credit taper rates and increasing work allowances</mark>"
2017,<mark> Raising the national living wage by 6</mark>
2018,<mark>6% to £9</mark>
2019,"<mark>50 from April will mean an extra £1,000 a year for fulltime workers</mark>"
2020,"<mark> It is good to know that there are 1,200 extra work coaches in Scotland alone</mark>"
2021,"<mark> We must of course highlight the household support fund, which has provided £500 million of support across the United Kingdom, with £41 million going to Scotland and the Scottish Government</mark>"
2022,<mark>5 million households</mark>
2023,"<mark> Households are struggling with the rise in global energy prices; with inflation as a result of spending decisions taken by Governments across the world, including this Government, who have invested £315 billion to get us through the global pandemic; and, of course, with rising prices of essential items such as food because of continued supply chain issues, again as a result of the pandemic</mark>"
2024,"<mark> The SNP motion that we are debating makes reference to tax rises, which is very interesting given that for the past decade and a half SNP colleagues have been running the country that is the highesttaxed part of the United Kingdom</mark>"
2025,"<mark> Member for Na hEileanan an Iar Angus Brendan MacNeil says it is about the rich, but it is not; it is about the 1</mark>"
2026,"<mark>1 million Scottish taxpayers who earn more than £27,393</mark>"
2027,<mark> That is not rich; that is 1</mark>
2028,<mark>1 million people across Scotland</mark>
2029,"<mark> Those who earn just over £27,000 are not the rich; people across Scotland are being punished by SNP decisions</mark>"
2030,"<mark> Since 1999, more money than ever before has been going from the UK Government to the Scottish Government, and what do they do to local councils They cut the local government budget by £371 million</mark>"
2031,"<mark> Gentleman will show that he stands up for his constituents, just like SNP council leaders have stood up to the Scottish Government and said, That is a cut too far, and that they should change their view on the £371 million cut to local government</mark>"
2032,"<mark> Indeed, during the pandemic, £15 billion or £16 billion has gone from the UK Government to the Scottish Government</mark>"
2033,"<mark> I only hope that SNP Members reflecting on todays debate will begin to ask serious questions of their Government in Holyrood, as they have been in power for a decade and a half and have many of the tools, levers and, indeed, the funding to deal with this issue right now in Scotland</mark>"
2034,<mark> Gentleman recall which of the following schemes rolled out since March 2020 he did not approve of the job coaches or kickstart schemes; the restart schemes; the lifetime skills guarantee; the holiday activity fund; the household support programme; or perhaps we should just remember the furlough schemes that protected the jobs and livelihoods of millions of people throughout the United Kingdom Did any of those schemes not help the Scots</mark>
2035,<mark> Office for National Statistics data shows that in December the consumer prices index and retail prices index showed average price increases of 5</mark>
2036,<mark>4% and 7</mark>
2037,<mark>5% respectively</mark>
2038,"<mark> We have unemployment back to prepandemic levels, and we have multiple job vacancieslast time I looked there were 1</mark>"
2039,<mark>25 million of them</mark>
2040,<mark> The SNP must realise that we cannot spend £400 billion and be some £2</mark>
2041,"<mark>2 trillion in debt without needing some degree of responsible management of the public finances going forward, especially when we will have rising interest rates in the future</mark>"
2042,"<mark> Friend the Member for Broadland Jerome Mayhew, there is the 6</mark>"
2043,"<mark>6% rise in the national living wage, which is the highest everit is the highest  rate of pay that the United Kingdom has ever hadand the universal credit taper will help some 2 million families</mark>"
2044,"<mark> However, what does not grab the headlines or really get picked up in the House is the other support that the Government give, including half a billion pounds through the household support fund and £200 million for the holiday activities programme, which is still being run</mark>"
2045,"<mark> But when we look at the statistics on the OECD website, between Q3 2019prepandemicand Q3 2021, we are the third worst performing country in the G20</mark>"
2046,<mark>I am glad to have this opportunity to respond on behalf of the Government</mark>
2047,"<mark> The £400 billion of direct economic support has protected millions of peoples livelihoods in every part of the United Kingdom, with the furlough and selfemployment income support schemes safeguarding, in Scotland alone, more than 1 million jobs</mark>"
2048,"<mark> That is why, at the autumn Budget, we confirmed that the devolved Administrations are receiving an extra £12</mark>"
2049,"<mark>6 billion of Barnettbased funding this year, taking total block grant funding to £77</mark>"
2050,<mark>6 billion</mark>
2051,<mark>7 billion a year to the DAs on top of their annual £66 billion baseline</mark>
2052,<mark> That funding equates to an average of £4</mark>
2053,"<mark>6 billion a year more for the Scottish Government, £2</mark>"
2054,<mark>5 billion more for the Welsh Government and £1</mark>
2055,<mark>6 billion a year more for the Northern Ireland Executive</mark>
2056,"<mark> Inflation is expected to average around 4% this year, 2</mark>"
2057,<mark>6% next year and then to return to target by the end of 2023</mark>
2058,"<mark> I should remind the House that we are providing support, worth about £12 billion in this financial year and next, to help families with those challenges</mark>"
2059,"<mark> However, the wider point stands we are providing £12 billion this year and next</mark>"
2060,"<mark> That is a tax cut for nearly 2 million lowincome families, worth £2</mark>"
2061,"<mark>2 billion in the next financial year, or, on average, about an extra £1,000 in their pockets</mark>"
2062,"<mark> Furthermore, from this April we will increase the national living wage by 6</mark>"
2063,<mark>6% to £9</mark>
2064,"<mark>50 an hour, benefiting more than 2 million workers across the UK</mark>"
2065,"<mark> We have also frozen fuel duty for the 12th year in a row, which means that the average UK car driver will save about £1,900 compared to the level in 2010</mark>"
2066,"<mark> We have increased it significantly Great Britainwide, so  that it stands at the 30th percentile of market rates, and we have made a commitment to keep cash levels at those higher rates in the future</mark>"
2067,<mark> We are providing nearly £5 billion to help children and young people catch up on lost learning</mark>
2068,"<mark> In September we announced the £500 million household support fund to help vulnerable people throughout the UK with essentials such as energy, clothing and food bills this winter</mark>"
2069,"<mark> Of course, we are also giving NHS workers throughout the United Kingdom a 3% pay rise in recognition of their service during the pandemic</mark>"
2070,"<mark>If we look at the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts, we see that they are for 6</mark>"
2071,<mark>5% growth in 2021 and 6% growth in 2022</mark>
2072,"<mark> With regard to the Kickstart scheme, we obviously always want to encourage maximum uptake and we continue to work to refine that scheme and make sure it works to best effect, but it must be considered in the context of an unemployment rate that is now only just over 4%</mark>"
2073,"<mark> VAT is charged at 5% on energy and if people are spending more of their disposable income on energy and less on issues that are taxed at the full rate, the Exchequer gets less money rather than more, so it is a net cost to the Exchequer</mark>"
2074,"<mark> In the Budget, we committed to increasing skills spending in England by £3</mark>"
2075,"<mark>8 billion over the Parliament, and the plan for jobs is therefore giving people the invaluable tools they need to succeed</mark>"
2076,"<mark> We all feel that keenly, but we are equally clear that we face a £400 billion bill for covid costs</mark>"
2077,"<mark> That is why we are investing  £600 billion in the public sector over the course of this Parliament, on our health service, our education system, and securing our borders</mark>"
2078,"<mark> That is why, at the spending review, we took the total we have committed to the economic infrastructure to £130 billion</mark>"
2079,"<mark> In fact, a sustained one percentage point increase in interest rates and inflation would cost over £22 billion by 202627</mark>"
2080,"<mark> Those saved thousands of jobs, including in the business of which I formerly had the honour to be managing director</mark>"
2081,"<mark> Without a CBIL, that companywhich employs more than 1,000 people, including several hundred in Scotlandwould likely have gone to the wall</mark>"
2082,"<mark> It has not and is now growing againprobably because I am no longer directly involved in itand it is creating many hundreds more jobs, here and in America</mark>"
2083,"<mark> Now, as we leave this dreadful pandemic behind usI hopewe have 4</mark>"
2084,<mark>2% unemployment throughout the country</mark>
2085,"<mark> In my constituency, it is at about 3</mark>"
2086,<mark>2%</mark>
2087,<mark> The reduction of the taper rate from 63% to 55% should make good tabloid headlines</mark>
2088,"<mark> All those involved in that part of the economy know the importance of that injection of about £2 billion into the pockets of those who are least well off, as they move from benefits into employment</mark>"
2089,"<mark> That is incredibly important, and I am grateful to the Government for focusing their firepower on the taper rate, rather than on the attentiongrabbing £20aweek part of universal credit, because that is where it can do most good</mark>"
2090,<mark> The most recent rise of 6</mark>
2091,"<mark>6%, to £9</mark>"
2092,"<mark>50, well above the forecast average inflation rate of 4% for the rest of this year, is the latest in a long line of aboveinflation hourly rate rises under the national living wage</mark>"
2093,"<mark> Particularly important, from my perspective, are the household support fund, with £500 million going directly towards utilities support; the warm homes discount, which reduces the price of heating by £140 per household, at a cost of £200 million to the taxpayer; and cold weather payments, which provide £25 per week to up to 4 million people in this country</mark>"
2094,<mark> We need security of supply and we need to support domestic extraction during the period of transition between now and 2035</mark>
2095,<mark> The Committee on Climate Change itself recognises that we need oil and gas resources between now and 2035</mark>
2096,"<mark> Member for giving way, but did he hear the Chief Secretary to the Treasury say that VAT is charged at 5% on energy and, if households are not spending on other things that are taxed at 20%, the net income for the Treasury is likely to be negative</mark>"
2097,"<mark> If she has been looking at the opinion polls over the weekend, she will see that support for independence in Scotland is at 50%considerably more than support for her own partyso I am afraid that her calls on us to stop talking about independence will very much fall on deaf ears</mark>"
2098,<mark> I currently have a fixed 12 month tariff and pay £86</mark>
2099,<mark> I expected prices to rise and expected £200300 more a year however based on their new tariffs I am looking at an extra £1000 to £2000 per year</mark>
2100,"<mark> Gentleman will be cognisant of the fact that Norway has an oil fund that is worth more than $1 billion, while Scotlands oil fund is worth absolutely nothing on his partys watch</mark>"
2101,<mark> Does the Minister really think that a £2</mark>
2102,"<mark> Gentleman will be pleased to know that in the runup to the independence referendum in 2014, we offered the public in Scotland more information about the currency alone than his party offered voters across the UK on the whole Brexit debate</mark>"
2103,"<mark> Friend agree it is disgusting that there are now more food banks in the UK than McDonalds restaurants, that almost 25% of folk in the UK are in poverty and that the Office for National Statistics calculated that the richest 10% of households hold 44% of the wealth while the poorest 50% own 9%all under this Governments watch</mark>"
2104,<mark>The Living Wage Foundation has classified a living wage as an hourly rate of £11</mark>
2105,<mark>05 in London and £9</mark>
2106,<mark>A survey last year by 38 Degrees found that 36% of people asked in my constituency of Stockport had seen their energy bills rise</mark>
2107,"<mark> Meanwhile, half of Britons say that they could not afford an additional £50 a month or £12 a week on their cost of living</mark>"
2108,"<mark> All the while, the safety net of the furlough scheme and the £20 universal credit uplift have been swept from under peoples feet</mark>"
2109,"<mark> In my constituency, the average rent for a twobedroom property is an unaffordable £800 a month</mark>"
2110,"<mark> Despite a recent review of the local housing allowance and a subsequent rise, the calculated rate is only £650 a month, so many people fall short</mark>"
2111,"<mark> This is a country where there is great poverty, but what is worse than the fact that millions of people are working themselves into an early grave through mental illness because they fear they cannot afford to feed their children, is that there are many people in this country for whom the story is the complete opposite</mark>"
2112,"<mark> As I said in this House last week, the most alarming statistic to me is that 171 of the richest people in Britain could afford to cover every single penny the Government have spent in responding to covidmore than £400 billion</mark>"
2113,"<mark>Forgive me, but I think that most people will find that argument rather perverse 5% on someones electricity bill is still 5%, and if it doubles or trebles, that is two or three times more than the Government were taking before</mark>"
2114,<mark> That is why the cut of £20 a week to the 6 million poorest households in Britain is so iniquitous and so immoral</mark>
2115,"<mark>5 million people on legacy benefits, including many people with disabilities, who depend on their heating so much more</mark>"
2116,"<mark> Last weeks Joseph Rowntree Foundation report on poverty in 2022 highlights the twochild limit, which I have fought since 2015 but which remains on the Governments statute book, driving up child poverty with every passing day; the benefit capin Scotland, 67</mark>"
2117,<mark>8% of capped households are singleparent households; the fiveweek wait for the first universal credit payment; unaffordable debt deductions from benefits; and the freezing of local housing allowance rates since April 2020</mark>
2118,<mark> The Office for Budget Responsibility has said that real wages will be lower in 2026 than they were in 2008</mark>
2119,"<mark> My former caseworker, Ellenor Hutson, has reflected that food banks were a rarity when she began advice work in 2005</mark>"
2120,"<mark> Yet in 202021, the Trussell Trust distributed over 2</mark>"
2121,"<mark>5 million food parcels across the UK, which is up 128% in the past five years</mark>"
2122,"<mark> Macmillan points out that about one in six people with cancer see their household fuel bills rise because of their diagnosis, with the average cost for those affected reaching £100 a month</mark>"
2123,"<mark> National Energy Action estimates  that 6 million6 millionUK households will be living in fuel poverty by April, a 50% increase from 2021</mark>"
2124,"<mark> Resolution Foundation research shows that on average families will be £1,200 worse off in April and that fuel stress will dramatically increase from April due the higher energy price cap</mark>"
2125,"<mark> New Joseph Rowntree Foundation analysis also warns that the energy price cap will have a harsher impact on the poorest families, who will spend on average 18% of their income after housing costs on energy bills after April</mark>"
2126,"<mark> Lord Agnew showed some couragemore courage than anybody on the Government Benches hereby resigning over the fraudulent misuse of bounce back loans further billions to the amount they have allowed fraudsters to walk out the door with, including £4</mark>"
2127,"<mark>3 billion from the covid support schemes alone, while so many were completely excluded from UK Government support</mark>"
2128,"<mark> According to Best for Britain, a total of £19</mark>"
2129,"<mark>3 billion has been wasted by the Prime Minister since he came to powerall that while the Tories play their political games, shifting the blame for tax rises, filling suitcases full of booze, and ducking questions about lies and parties</mark>"
2130,"<mark> We have a debttoGDP ratio of over 100%, we have more than £2</mark>"
2131,<mark>4 trillion in debt and we are spending more on servicing the national debt than on the entire education budget£55 billion</mark>
2132,"<mark>No one could fail to be moved by the pictures of the devastation in Tonga that has followed the tsunami, but there are good links between Tonga and our country, not least through some of the fantastic Tongan rugby players who are playing  hereincluding Malakai Fekitoa, who has set up a relief fund that has already raised £50,000</mark>"
2133,"<mark> Malakai plays for the Wasps in Warwickshire, and the club has said that it will donate 20% of its ticket revenues from the match that will take place this weekend</mark>"
2134,<mark>4 million</mark>
2135,<mark>How can the Minister possibly claim that the UK is leading in this kind of response when the severity and frequency of natural and climate disasters is only increasing yet the UK budget for response is falling significantly and dramatically Will she confirm whether the costs of the HMS Spey will also be countedwe might say doublecountedtowards NATOs 2% target for military spending</mark>
2136,"<mark> More generally, since 2015 Tonga has received more than £25 million of UK aid through our core funding to multilateral institutions</mark>"
2137,"<mark> In fact, I have fond memories of attending an international rugby league tournament in Hawaii in the 1990s, when I first saw the Tongans playbut let us return to more serious matters</mark>"
2138,"<mark> Since 2015, Tonga has received more than £26</mark>"
2139,"<mark>9 million of aid, as I mentioned, through multilateral organisations</mark>"
2140,"<mark> Indeed, more than £300 million in aid has been provided to other, similar Pacific island states</mark>"
2141,<mark> It is also why it is so important that we work towards delivery of the $100 billion climate finance goal</mark>
2142,<mark> It is estimated that no fewer than 44 low to middleincome countries have debts to Beijing that represent in excess of 10% of their GDP</mark>
2143,"<mark> Indeed, we estimate that, since 2015, the Pacific island countries have received more than £357 million of UK funding through those organisations</mark>"
2144,"<mark> A volcanic blast visible from space, more powerful than an atomic bomb, it has affected 85% of Tongans through not just the eruption itself, but ash, which now poses a threat to drinking supplies and public health, and the tsunami that swept away their homes and washed Lisala Folau out to sea</mark>"
2145,"<mark> Why have we not promised any new bilateral aid, since we have not given them a penny this year Does she regret the decision to cut aid to our Commonwealth partners more generally by £500 million, and does she accept that the aid cut leaves us responding to disasters such as this with one hand tied behind our back Under our presidency of COP26, attention was rightly given to the vulnerability of small island developing states such as Tonga</mark>"
2146,"<mark>The tsunami and the effects of the volcano eruption brought back painful memories for many of us who lost friends and relatives in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, so we know the pain that many are suffering</mark>"
2147,"<mark> We wish Commander Proudman and his crew on HMS Spey the very best for their mission there, but will the Minister look seriously at the longterm consequences of this The UN estimates that 60% to 70% of livestockowning households have seen animals perish on the islands</mark>"

2151,"<mark> Before we come to questions, I wish to make a short statement in relation to question 5</mark>"

2158,"<mark> Ladys initial question, the UK has committed £286 million and already distributed £145 million</mark>"
2159,"<mark> We have supported more than 3,400 people in leaving Afghanistan since the end of the Operation Pitting evacuation in August</mark>"

2161,"<mark>The UK has supported more than 3,400 people in leaving Afghanistan since the end of the Operation Pitting evacuation and we will continue in our efforts</mark>"
2162,<mark> The UK is contributing £286 million in humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan in this financial year and we have disbursed more than £145 million already so far</mark>
2163,"<mark> It adds to one of the worlds greatest humanitarian disasters, with an estimated 20 million Yemenis in need of assistance</mark>"

2165,<mark>The situation facing millions of Afghans right now is unimaginablestarving families lining up for food; parents selling their babies and handing teenage daughters to the Taliban for cash; a mother so desperate that she sold her kidney and two of her daughters</mark>
2166,"<mark> Yet amid this horror the UK Government slashed the overseas aid budget, actually cut their support for Afghanistan from 2019 levels and, with only two months to go, disbursed only half of the humanitarian aid and assistance they promised</mark>"
2167,"<mark> With 5 million children now on the brink of famine, will the Government show leadership by releasing the remainder of the pledge and taking the action proposed by the UN, Save the Children and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown by convening a humanitarian pledging conference to raise the £5 billion needed Failure to act will cost more lives</mark>"

2170,"<mark> With mounting threats of Russian hostility, can the Minister tell the House what discussions she has had with colleagues across Government on the proposed implementation of the counter state threats Bill, the new and refreshed Computer Misuse Act 1990, the reform of Companies House and the register of property ownership, so that London will no longer have the reputation of being the laundromat for the dirty money that comes out of such regimes</mark>"
2171,"<mark>Could the Minister reassure the House that there are no other Members who have received hundreds of thousands of pounds of funding without question from hostile actors, and what confidence the public can therefore have in this Parliament</mark>"

2178,"<mark> I echo the words of the then Prime Minister David Cameron, who, following the publication of the Saville report in 2010, stood at this Dispatch Box and apologised on behalf of the British Government, describing the events of Bloody Sunday, rightly, as unjustified and unjustifiable</mark>"
2179,"<mark> We also have to be honest with people about what is achievable and the reality of what we can do, bearing in mind the Northern Ireland Sentences Act 1998 that followed the Good Friday agreement, decommissioning and other things that have happened since then</mark>"
2180,"<mark> The Parachute Regiment rightly condemned the flying of those flags as a grossly offensive act against the victims of Bloody Sunday, but they have yet to apologise for and condemn the actions of their soldiers on Bloody Sunday in Derry in 1972</mark>"

2190,<mark>We have supported the Environment Agency with additional funding of some £60 million in 2019I think it wasand by making sure that they have the right regulatory framework in which to go forward</mark>
2191,"<mark> As the Minister will know, largescale flytipping more than doubled in England between 2012 and 2019, with councils spending almost £13 million last year cleaning up somebody elses mess</mark>"
2192,"<mark>Will the Government ensure that the section 33 offence attracts a fixed penalty of at least £2,000, much more than the price of a skip At the moment, it is a rational economic decision for people to flytip, albeit a horrendously antisocial one</mark>"
2193,"<mark> The fixed penalty for the section 34 offence should also rise to £1,000, so that we can kill off the illegal waste industry that is turning parts of our beautiful country into a litter tip</mark>"

2244,"<mark> There needs to be a greater understanding and appreciation that, from the early 1930s onwards, this systematic approach led to the Shoah</mark>"

2271,"<mark> First, we must remember and mourn the 8 million Jews who died in camps</mark>"
2272,"<mark> A November 2021 survey led by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany found that 9% of respondents believed that the holocaust was myth, or that the number of Jews killed in the holocaust had been greatly exaggerated</mark>"
2273,"<mark> It is no surprise that between January and June 2021, 1,308 antisemitic events were recordedthe highest number in any recorded year, and an increase of 49% since 2020</mark>"
2274,"<mark> Right now in Tigray, thousands have been killed and rape is being used as a systematic weapon of war, and people from Tigray are being taken off the streets of Addis Ababa and detained</mark>"

2298,"<mark> We have seen these things in Burma too, and in Rwanda, where in 1994 nearly 1 million people, predominantly Tutsis, were murdered by their Hutu neighbours over 90 days</mark>"
2299,"<mark>  Britain has done neither, even though, extraordinarily, the arrest warrants were issued as long ago as 2006</mark>"
2300,"<mark> In 2015 and 2017, a British district judge and our own High Court ruled that, even though the evidence was compelling, none of the suspects could be sent back to Rwanda, because such action could breach their human rights</mark>"

2311,<mark> The first half of 2021 saw the highest number of antisemitic incidents in a sixmonth period recorded by the Community Security Trust</mark>
2312,<mark> This evening I will be lighting a candle in remembrance of the millions of lives lost in the holocaust and the genocides that followed</mark>
2313,<mark> We remember the 6 million Jews who were targeted and murdered by a fascist regime that used vile antisemitism to justify and legitimise its cruel treatment of millions of innocents</mark>
2314,"<mark> We must not forget the millions of others who were murdered under this regimemillions of Soviet civilians and prisoners of war, Roma and Sinti people, Polish, Serbian and Slovenian citizens, LGBT people, the disabled and so many more</mark>"
2315,"<mark> In Europe, more than one in four Jewish people has experienced antisemitic harassment at least once, and almost half have expressed that they are worried about being subjected to antisemitic verbal insults or harassment</mark>"
2316,"<mark> In France, with the worlds third biggest Jewish population, records showed a 74% spike in antisemitic acts between 2017 and 2018, and in Germany antisemitic incidents had risen by more than 19% on the previous year</mark>"
2317,"<mark>I rise to speak today to commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day, which, on the anniversary of the liberation of AuschwitzBirkenau, commemorates the 6 million Jews murdered during the holocaust, alongside the millions killed under Nazi persecution of other groups, including Roma and  Sinti people, Slavic people, LGBT and disabled people and political and religious minorities</mark>"
2318,"<mark> I have seen the piles of teeth, hair and shoes that represent a tiny fraction of those who passed through AuschwitzBirkenau, and how small those chambers were, with up to 1,200 people piled into a tiny space so that no poison gas would be wasted</mark>"
2319,"<mark> This was not, as we might imagine, a quick process, with it taking up to 12 minutes to be poisoned to death, crushed in among hundreds of panicking people, desperately trying to cling to life, trying to break or claw their way out</mark>"
2320,<mark> Seven hundred Jews were murdered in the gas chambers on the very day before they were set to be liberated and many more died by disease or by suicide in the months following liberation</mark>

2327,"<mark> What I and millions of others want to hear is apart from getting caught out in all of this, what is the Prime Minister personally sorry and genuinely regretful for in his own conduct If he just resorts to that tired, hackneyed form of words that he used to begin with, does that not show that it is not a new Office of the Prime Minister that we need but a new Prime Minister in office</mark>"
2328,<mark>With this it will be convenient to consider Lords amendments 2 to 15</mark>
2329,"<mark> That is something that he has tirelessly encouraged, and it goes along with the Government policy of trying to move Ministries outside SW1 to other parts of the country, to ensure greater involvement of people up and down the country from various degrees of experience</mark>"

2332,"<mark> Is that why the Government have so far failed to take the Russian threat to our democracy seriously How will what has been announced today help Will the Foreign  Secretary pledge to this House to fly at least business class to Moscow in the next couple of weeks, instead of using half a million pounds of taxpayers money, as she did when she flew to Australia</mark>"
2333,<mark>We are reviewing the tier 1 visas that were granted before 5 April</mark>
2334,"<mark> We are reviewing the tier 1 visas and will introduce the economic crime Bill, which Her Majestys Treasury is working on</mark>"
2335,"<mark>We are already spending more than 2% of our GDP; we are the largest European NATO supplier of troops and security around Europe, and we want to see others step up, because, as my hon</mark>"

2338,"<mark>What we are actually doing is cutting crime by 14% and putting 20,000 more police on the streets</mark>"
2339,"<mark> In addition, we are stepping up our investment in Ukraines future, ramping up support for trade up to £3</mark>"

2341,<mark>7 billion to boost Ukraines naval capability</mark>
2342,"<mark> Also, not going ahead with Nord Stream 2 is very important from the Russian point of view</mark>"

2349,<mark> I have been to one of them today that is creating tens of thousands of new jobs</mark>
2350,"<mark> At the same time, we have been cutting crime by 14%, building 40 new hospitals and rolling out gigabit broadband, and delivering all the promises of our 2019 agenda, so that we have the fastest economic growth of the G7</mark>"
2351,<mark>Section 5</mark>
2352,<mark> It does not work to try to look tough when the Government have refused to deal with the issue of tier 1 visas</mark>
2353,<mark> This has been going on for ages; we have been giving them out to thousands of Russian oligarchs</mark>
2354,"<mark>I had a discussion with my colleague Foreign Minister Baerbock last week about precisely this issue, and I welcome the statements from her and Chancellor Scholz about Nord Stream 2, in which they were very clear that it will not go ahead in the event of a Russian incursion</mark>"
2355,"<mark> Our university research base alone contributes £95 billion to the economy, supporting nearly 1 million jobs in science institutes, charities and businesses of all sizes</mark>"
2356,"<mark> We are equally clear that without Lords amendment 1, that may not be the case</mark>"
2357,"<mark> In 2014, Britain had probably the most important and groundbreaking artificial intelligence company in  the world, DeepMind, but instead of capitalising on this cuttingedge technology and instead of introducing an effective support system for startups, the Government allowed it to be sold to Google for £400 million, with no investigation or action</mark>"
2358,"<mark> In 2020, early investor Humayun Sheikh estimated that DeepMind would be worth $30 billion now</mark>"
2359,"<mark> That is a huge reward on the investment, but not one that has gone to UK taxpayers or UK citizens, and the UK is now in effect losing out on billions in economic benefits</mark>"
2360,"<mark> The Governmentand, indeed, the Minister in his commentshave tried to claim that Lords amendment 1 is not needed because they believe that the National Security and Investment Act already gives sufficient powers to scrutinise and intervene in takeover bids</mark>"
2361,<mark> Lords amendments 9 and 10 remove the Ministers powers to determine a pension or gratuity for nonexecutive ARIA members</mark>
2362,"<mark> Without Lords amendment 1, we have no assurances that that will happen</mark>"
2363,"<mark> I hope that over the course of the remaining debate, to which I am sure there will be an extensive number of contributions, he may be swayed to agree to Lords amendment 1</mark>"
2364,<mark> Amendments 2 to 8 relate to changes the Government made in response to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committees report on the Bill</mark>
2365,"<mark> The effect of those amendments is to omit clause 10, which contained a broader power to make consequential provision, and to replace it with a narrower, more specific power in clause 8</mark>"
2366,"<mark>Taxpayersubsidised childcare is increasingly being taken over by large forprofit companies quartered overseas, according to new research by University College London and the Nuffield Foundation</mark>"

2373,<mark>3 billion of the money that was stolen during covid through the furlough scheme and other schemes is being written off by Her Majestys Revenue and Customs</mark>
2374,<mark> Does the Minister share my concern about the difference that that cash could have made in meeting the target of more than £15 billion that the Governments own tsar reckoned was needed to catch up on the days that our children have lost in school Will she call for a review of this</mark>
2375,<mark> It is a loss that is literally beyond words; a loss that hundreds and thousands of parents have tragically experienced during this pandemic</mark>
2376,"<mark>On 20 January, more than 415,000 pupils were off school and 15% of teachers were absent, but only 9,000 air purifiers have been promised, for approximately 300,000 classrooms</mark>"
2377,"<mark> The Minister lauds the Government response, yet Germany has promised to subsidise 80% of the cost of air cleaning equipment in all schools to ensure that education is not disrupted</mark>"

2380,"<mark>I propose, with the leave of the House, that we take motions 8 and 9 together</mark>"
2381,"<mark> 83A7,</mark>"
2382,"<mark> The need to clean up the dirty money in our economy is not just about doing the right thing and standing up alongside the people of Ukraine, but about standing up for the British people, defending ourselves against the corruption that flows through our system, and making sure that our houses, our homes, are not being exploited to pay murderers on behalf of a dictator</mark>"
2383,"<mark>Six months ago, the Government said that they were finalising their report into how more than 700 Russian millionaires were fasttracked for British residency via their socalled golden visa scheme</mark>"
2384,<mark> Can the Foreign Secretary tell the House when that longoverdue report will be published Does she agree that the reason for the delay relates directly to the £4 million that has been donated to the Conservative party by seven individuals who have deep and highly dubious links to the Kremlin</mark>
2385,"<mark>I beg to move, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 1</mark>"
2386,"<mark>I must draw the Houses attention to the fact that financial privilege is engaged by Lords amendments 1, 12 and 14</mark>"
2387,"<mark>Having the required management expertise to run dozens of offices with hundreds of people within, is one thing</mark>"
2388,"<mark> Does she agree that it is important now to go back to our German partners and reemphasise the need for them to stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which gives the Russians an umbilical cord to the heart of Europe We import less than 1</mark>"

2392,"<mark> I hope to have the chance to visit him in Sheffield before too long to discuss how we can use some of the funding that was allocated in the spending review more effectively on his behalf, and how we can ensure that future spending commitments from the Chancellor and from others serve the people whom he serves</mark>"

2398,"<mark> A total of £500 million was announced by the Government in 2019 for the youth investment fund, but the first £10 million of capital funding was opened to bids only just a few weeks ago</mark>"
2399,"<mark>Since 2010, Conservative Governments have cut £2</mark>"
2400,<mark>1 billion in funds to Sheffield City Council</mark>
2401,<mark> Our annual grant is £288 million lower in real terms</mark>

2403,<mark>Wirral Council is facing a budget black hole of more than £20 million</mark>
2404,"<mark> Woodchurch leisure centre and swimming pool and libraries in Greasby, Irby, Hoylake, Pensby and Woodchurch are all under threat of closure because of Wirral Council having to make up to £27 million of savings as a direct result of brutal cuts from Conservative Governments since 2010, so can the Secretary of State make sure that he provides emergency funding to save these vital services</mark>"
2405,"<mark>With this scheme, the highlands are set to lose out on tens of millions of pounds compared with EU funding</mark>"
2406,<mark>Wales is set to be denied £4</mark>
2407,"<mark>6 billion as a result of the Government classifying HS2 as an England and Wales project, despite the Treasury finding that Wales would lose out on £150 million per annum as a result of HS2</mark>"
2408,"<mark> If underperforming places were levelled up towards the UK average, unlocking their full potential, this could boost aggregate UK GDP by tens of billions of pounds each year</mark>"
2409,"<mark> We will also improve digital connectivity, with billions of pounds of investment, bringing nationwide gigabitcapable broadband and 4G coverage to the whole UK, and we will expand 5G coverage to the overwhelming majority of the population</mark>"
2410,<mark> That is why we are investing more than £20 billion in research and development to create a science and technology superpower</mark>
2411,"<mark> Today, we are allocating £100 million specifically to three new innovation accelerators in the west midlands, Glasgow and Greater Manchester</mark>"
2412,"<mark> It is also why we are investing £5 billion in bus services and active travel, with new bus investment today in all our mayoral combined authorities and the green light for bus projects in StokeonTrent, Derbyshire, Warrington and across the country</mark>"
2413,"<mark> That is why we are investing in 20 new urban regeneration projects, starting in Wolverhampton and Sheffield and spreading across the midlands and the north, with £1</mark>"
2414,<mark>8 billion invested in new housing infrastructure to turn brownfield land into projects across the country like Stratford and Kings Cross in London</mark>

2416,"<mark>5 billion levellingup home building fund will give loans to small and mediumsized builders to deliver new homes, the vast majority of which will be outside London and the southeast</mark>"
2417,<mark> That is why we are investing £230 million extra in grassroots football and using the community ownership fund to help fans take back control of clubs such as Bury FC</mark>
2418,"<mark> There will also be another £30 million allocated to improving parks and urban green spaces, as well as plans to regreen all of our green belt</mark>"
2419,"<mark> Fighting crime and antisocial behaviour is essential to giving communities new heart, so we will invest an additional £150 million in our safer streets fund and ensure that those who drag down our communities through vandalism, graffiti and joyriding pay back their debt to those communities</mark>"
2420,"<mark>Hounslow is in the second most prosperous UK subregion by gross value added, but thanks to 11 years of Government policies, 40% of Hounslows children live in poverty, so when will levelling up address inequality within communities as well as between them</mark>"
2421,"<mark>The allparty parliamentary group on the UK shared prosperity fund, which I am proud to chair, has been calling on the Government to ensure that not a single penny is lost in the transition from the European structural funds to the SPF, but calculations by the Welsh Government confirm that the SPF will leave the UK close to £1 billion worse off and that Wales will get £750 million less</mark>"
2422,<mark> Friend agree that the creation of at least one freeport in Scotland will result in investment and thousands of jobs and demonstrates why our Union is so effective at delivering for our communities</mark>
2423,"<mark> To help businesses invest and grow, we are extending the annual investment allowance at its highestever level of £1 million until 31 March 2023</mark>"
2424,<mark> The £1 million AIA level means that more than 99% of businesses will have their plant and machinery expenditure covered</mark>
2425,<mark> The Bill sets the rate of the bank surcharge so that the combined rate on banks profits will increase to 28% from April 2023</mark>
2426,<mark> It also increases the surcharge allowance to £100 million</mark>
2427,"<mark>25% increase on dividend income rates from 6 April 2022 will help fund the health and social care settlement, ensuring that contributions are made based on employed and selfemployed earnings</mark>"
2428,<mark> The Government are also introducing the new 4% residential developer tax on the most profitable developers</mark>
2429,"<mark> This will raise at  least £2 billion over the next decade to help pay for the removal of unsafe cladding, providing reassurance to home owners and boosting confidence in the UK housing market</mark>"
2430,<mark> The economic crime levy will help deliver the Governments objectives to combat economic crime and will raise an expected £100 million per year to fund antilaundering measures</mark>
2431,"<mark> The measures are accompanied by an increase in the duty charge on tobacco products by 2% and a rise in the minimum excise tax to 3% above RPI inflation, alongside new measures to tackle duty evasion</mark>"
2432,"<mark> That tax rise, when combined with energy price rises and other tax hikes, will leave families on average £1,200 worse off a year</mark>"
2433,"<mark> By the middle of the week, he is using the Bill to cut taxes for banks by £1 billion a year</mark>"
2434,<mark> The Housing Secretary now says that he is planning to convince developers to hand over £4 billion voluntarily</mark>
2435,"<mark>I congratulate the Secretary of State on his Levelling Up paper, but particularly mission 7 to level up health outcomes and wellbeing</mark>"
2436,"<mark> These proposals ride roughshod over devolution, override our democratically elected Government and shortchange us to the tune of £1 billion by 2024</mark>"
2437,"<mark> So I implore the Secretary of State to listen to my constituents and the people of this country, respect devolution and restore the missing £1 billion to Wales</mark>"
2438,"<mark> He has presided over 150,000 deaths and the loss of nearly £5 billion of public money to fraudsters</mark>"
2439,"<mark> I remember Jack in the 70s leading the occupation of Centre Point in London, when London was littered with empty new office buildings while the homeless slept on the streets; in the 80s, when he bravely led the trade unions to oppose Militant in Liverpool; in the 90s, when he served on Labours national executive committee and worked to modernise the Labour party and make us fit to govern; and in the noughties, when he organised the cleaners strike here in Parliament when they were earning as little as £5 an hour</mark>"
2440,"<mark> SA Foods was a big agricultural combine, largely producing strawberries, about 30% of the British strawberry market</mark>"
2441,"<mark> It was a big workforce I am talking 4,000 to 5,000 people working on the land in the west country picking strawberries, but just for three months a year, and being very badly treated</mark>"
2442,"<mark> He worked his heart out on getting recognition, getting better terms and conditions and improving the lives of those thousands of people working on the land</mark>"
2443,"<mark> Despite its not getting through, the Government supported the measures, and Oona, Jack and others managed to change many thousands of peoples lives by improving the work done in council homes</mark>"
2444,"<mark> On behalf of myself and my family, I warmly thank all hon</mark>"
2445,"<mark> He picked battles on behalf of working people, then he won them</mark>"
2446,"<mark> He led the first equal pay strike after the Equal Pay Act 1970 was brought into law; he supported Asian women to unionise against a hostile management at Grunwick; and, even this year, he campaigned for a public inquiry on behalf of covid bereaved families</mark>"
2447,"<mark> That is because the issue meant so much to him, because of the thousands of workers at the site and what the company meant to the community</mark>"
2448,"<mark> On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the Scottish National party, I want to extend our deepest sympathies to all who knew and loved Jack</mark>"
2449,<mark> This contrasts so favourably with the billions of pounds of European aid that the Labour party wasted in Wales over the past 20 years</mark>
2450,"<mark>I welcome the enhanced bus service on its way to Derbyshire, the Derbyshire county deal and the fact that Derbyshire is going to be an education investment area, on top of the future high streets £10 million for Buxton, the £137 million for the Hope Valley upgrade and the £228 million Mottram bypass, but there is a democratic deficit I am worried about</mark>"
2451,"<mark>Since 2010, £465 million has been cut from Liverpool City Council, with £34 million in this coming financial year</mark>"
2452,<mark> Local government staff have had their pay cut by 20% since 2010 in real terms</mark>
2453,"<mark> Will the Secretary of State, if he is genuinely committed to tackling and reversing inequality, tell us when local government workers can expect a 50% pay increase like the commissioners in Liverpool City Council, or will he agree to meet me and my colleagues to look at that eyewatering decision</mark>"
2454,"<mark> In every year since the Government took office the use of food banks has increased, and last year 2</mark>"
2455,"<mark>5 million food parcels were given out to people who had gone up  to a complete stranger and said, Can you help me to feed my family What are the Government going to do to bring an end to this scandal</mark>"
2456,"<mark> I am sorry, but this Government provided £1 million to the fans of Bury FC so that they could take back control of the club</mark>"
2457,"<mark> That is why we have ensured that gigabit connectivity has gone from 10% to 60% in the past two years, and they have no plan</mark>"
2458,<mark> Friend the Chancellor has committed £500 million to tackling adult innumeracy; we know where that funding should go first</mark>
2459,<mark>I do not think Wales loses out as a result of HS2</mark>
2460,<mark> Gentleman that the Labour  party needs to sort out its position on HS2</mark>
2461,"<mark> When the Leader of the Opposition was campaigning to be elected in Camden, he said that one of top priorities was to oppose HS2, and then when we brought forward proposals to extend HS2, he criticised them</mark>"
2462,"<mark> Gentlemans heart is in the right place, but the Labour partys HS2 policy currently is not</mark>"
2463,"<mark> Seventeen years on, it is this Conservative Government who have given West Works six million quid to provide the new jobs that are needed locally</mark>"
2464,"<mark> I am sorry that we have not been able to get everyone in, but we did manage about 70 in the hour and a half that was allocated</mark>"
2465,"<mark>That is absolutely, totally, 100% correct, and it is my right hon</mark>"
2466,"<mark> I hope that most of us think that we have a Jack at home, but I still reckon that he could have made a fortune giving consultancy on how to be the longsuffering but supportive male other half</mark>"
2467,"<mark>Jack Dromey was my mentor, my teacher, my political partner and my friend for almost a decade and a half in Birmingham</mark>"
2468,"<mark> He used to very proudly say that his nickname in the union was Never snap, never flap Jack, and he reminded me of that very often as I was losing my rag over the last year and a half</mark>"
2469,"<mark>Levelling up in Bosworth uniquely looks like millions of pounds into Hinckley Academy, £28 million into Leicestershire broadband and £19</mark>"
2470,<mark>9 million into Twycross Zoo</mark>
2471,"<mark>This is a plan that provides opportunity and growth throughout every part of our country; I am looking particularly at mission 6, on skills training</mark>"
2472,"<mark> Gentleman mentions my time at Education, let me say that we protected, in realterms, funding for schools from five to 16; we introduced a pupil premium, which meant that £250 million of additional funding was targeted on the poorest; and in Bedford we opened Bedford Free School, an outstanding school that brought opportunity to disadvantaged children in his constituency</mark>"
2473,"<mark> First, can he ensure that LNER delivers on its promise of a direct rail service from Cleethorpes through to Kings Cross Urgent decision making was also referred to, and the way to help delivery of that would be to create a level 3 authority in the county</mark>"
2474,<mark> We  are providing a £140 rebate on energy bills for 2</mark>
2475,"<mark>2 million households with the lowest incomes, and we have the £300 winter fuel payment for pensioners</mark>"
2476,"<mark> He lost his brother last week and the funeral was yesterday, so I will make some comments on behalf of my party</mark>"
2477,"<mark> Let me offer my condolences, on behalf of the whole Government, to the Mother of the House, the right hon</mark>"
2478,<mark> 1 customer across the whole of the United Kingdom</mark>
2479,"<mark> We sat down, upon a closure where thousands of jobs were going to go, and Jack said, Were in this together; we will stand shoulder to shoulder with the people whose jobs are at risk</mark>"
2480,"<mark> We have lost out on Northern Powerhouse Rail, stifling £30 billionworth of investment over the next 10 years</mark>"
2481,"<mark> In Cheshire West and Chester, the Government have taken £466 million since 2010 from our local authority, and the only way we can win funding back is by bidding to this pot or that pot, which is decided by Ministers</mark>"
2482,"<mark> I thank the Secretary of State for awarding us £10 million in levelling up, but does he agree, looking at the overall picture, that the prosperity of northern industrial towns was built not with Government money, but by entrepreneurs in the 19th and early 20th century, when regulation and taxation were a fraction of what they are now What plans does he have, with his colleagues, to try to reduce the burden of regulation and taxation on towns in the north of England</mark>"
2483,"<mark>How can we take seriously the Secretary of States promise to turbocharge places such as my city when his Government have spent 12 years draining the fuel tank and slashing the tyres If his offer of a county deal is to deliver meaningful change, does it not need to start with restoring the £100 million that Nottingham has lost through cuts in council funding</mark>"
2484,<mark> We have suffered Tory cuts of nearly £200 million</mark>
2485,<mark>Six of the nine areas in Ceredigion rank in the bottom 10% of areas across the UK for decent broadband coverage</mark>
2486,"<mark> For every £13 they have taken from us, they have given us £1 back</mark>"
2487,<mark> Friends statement today and thank him for Southports £38</mark>
2488,<mark>5 million town deal</mark>
2489,"<mark> Under Labours fully costed plans, we would save every Scottish household £200 and save £600 for over 800,000 Scottish households hardest hit by the cost of living crisis</mark>"
2490,"<mark> That is proper action on this crisis for those both on and off the grid, like many thousands in the Secretary of States constituency</mark>"
2491,<mark> 19892405 N</mark>
2492,"<mark> I joined him when he said, I am going to lead this campaign on behalf of the trade unions</mark>"
2493,"<mark> We all walked through Aston for about a mile and a half to the factory, and spoke to the workers there</mark>"
2494,<mark> Jacks indefatigable campaigning on behalf of the trade union and labour movements touched six decades</mark>
2495,"<mark>I welcome this White Paper and the multibillion pound investments in brownfield regeneration, connectivity, research and development, and especially the innovation accelerators, which in Cheadle and across Greater Manchester will make a real difference to all those businesses that want the extra help to start up</mark>"
2496,"<mark>The west midlands has some worldleading, innovative companies as well as universities and research institutions doing groundbreaking research, but public research and development investment in the west midlands has been low compared with other areas, even though for every £1 of Government investment, we have seen a private sector return of £4</mark>"
2497,"<mark>We have delivered approximately £8 billion of support for the aviation sector through the pandemic, and we are currently developing a strategic framework to help support the sectors recovery</mark>"
2498,"<mark>I thank the Minister for her reply, but my experience is that ticket inspection falls very far short of 100%</mark>"
2499,<mark> She is right that £8</mark>
2500,"<mark>7 billion is a very significant sum of public money, but she also must acknowledge that that £8</mark>"
2501,"<mark>7 billion was not wasted, because the PPE exists</mark>"
2502,"<mark> Gentlemans specific point, he might characterise the £33</mark>"
2503,"<mark>9 billion increase by 202324, which we have enshrined in law, as part of the Brexit dividend</mark>"
2504,<mark> We know that £4</mark>
2505,"<mark>3 billion has been wasted, written off as covid loan fraud</mark>"
2506,"<mark> We know that the Government spent £12 billion on PPE in England up to March 2021, of which £9 billion has been declared by the Government themselves as wastedInterruption</mark>"
2507,"<mark> Given that the UK Governments VIP, Tory crony fast lanes for Tory party associates have been declared unlawful in the Court of Session and seen billions of pounds wastefully funnelled to politically connected friends of this Tory Government, does the Minister agree that his Government are fast becoming a kleptocracy</mark>"
2508,"<mark> Perhaps the Secretary of States silence and absence tell us that he is relaxed about losing billions of pounds of taxpayers money, or perhaps it is simply that he is too ashamed to show his face</mark>"
2509,<mark> Buried on page 199 was the revelation that the Department lost a staggering £8</mark>
2510,<mark>7 billion on PPE</mark>
2511,"<mark> How will they  explain to their voters that, taken together with the £4</mark>"
2512,<mark> Perhaps the Minister can explain why a global pandemic necessarily leads to Conservative party donors and the former Secretary of States pub landlord receiving special treatment and hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers money</mark>
2513,"<mark> Why did the Department fail to collect shipments from ports on time, costing taxpayers £111 million in additional fees Why did the Department fail to pay its bills on time and incur late fees of £1</mark>"
2514,"<mark> That is in addition to £63 million for Companies House reform and the introduction of the economic crime antimoney laundering levy, which will raise around £100 million per year from the private sector, to combat economic crime from 2023</mark>"

2519,"<mark> Between 2008 and 2015, we issued 205 Kazakh kleptocrats with golden visas to settle with their dirty money in the UK, which was the fifth most common country for users of the Tier 1 Investor scheme</mark>"
2520,<mark> A recent Chatham House report reveals that the Kazakh elite owns over half a billion pounds of property in the UK</mark>
2521,"<mark> Around £330 million of that belongs to Nazarbayevs extended family, including Sunninghill Park, allegedly bought by Nazarbayevs soninlaw for £15 million£3 million over the asking  price</mark>"

2523,"<mark>8 billionworth of assets, invested in everything from hotels to banks</mark>"
2524,"<mark> According to some experts, this shocking, violent suppression has left 225 dead, 4,500 injured and 10,000 arrested</mark>"

2528,"<mark> UK court documents show he received a $65 million loan from a bank in 2008, through a company which then made a further loan</mark>"

2541,"<mark> We have already recovered, through prevention or termination of contracts, £157 million of potential fraud</mark>"
2542,"<mark>For context, £9 billion would have given every NHS nurse a 100% bonus on their salary or it could provide the funding needed to solve the issue of autistic people and people with learning disabilities being detained in inappropriate units because no funding is available to support them in the community</mark>"
2543,"<mark> But Minister, reports of £8</mark>"
2544,<mark>7 billion losses are astounding</mark>
2545,<mark> Can the Minister confirm whether any of the promised £350 million a week advertised on the side of a bus as a benefit of leaving the European Union has been used to purchase PPE for the NHS</mark>
2546,"<mark> We secured billions of items of PPE, we obtained 30,000 ventilators by the end of June 2020 and we delivered more than 17</mark>"
2547,<mark>5 billion items to protect our frontline workers</mark>
2548,<mark> The action we took protected thousands of frontline healthcare workers in the NHS and social care</mark>
2549,<mark> Gentleman should also be aware that the vast bulk of that £8</mark>
2550,<mark>7 billion is down to exactly the same reason PPE purchased at the height of the market</mark>
2551,"<mark> Member for Worsley and Eccles South Barbara Keeley, who is no longer in her place, that a small proportion of this £8</mark>"
2552,"<mark>7 billion went on PPE that did not meet the standard, and we continue to pursue those contracts and investigate them</mark>"
2553,"<mark> Of course, in the two to two and a half years since, that market has stabilised, with significantly more manufacturing also in this country</mark>"
2554,"<mark> To his second point, he is absolutely right that, from about 1% of PPE being manufactured in the UK before the pandemic, we now have the capacity to manufacture about 70% of the PPE it is currently assessed we need in this country</mark>"
2555,<mark> She mentioned £9</mark>
2556,<mark>7 billion</mark>
2557,<mark> The sum involved is actually £8</mark>
2558,<mark>7 billion</mark>
2559,<mark> One of the first Acts after the 2019 election enshrined in law a £33</mark>
2560,"<mark>9 billion increase by 202324, and we are also putting in place the health and care levy to both assist our NHS and provide that sustainable footing for social care in the future</mark>"
2561,"<mark> I am sure that, in my constituency of North Shropshire, the £9</mark>"
2562,<mark>7 billion carelessly wasted could have been put to better use</mark>
2563,"<mark> It could have been used to tackle the extremely high ambulance waiting times, to help the local accident and emergency tackle the huge challenges it faces in getting patients through, or to deal with the £50 million black hole that social care in Shropshire is facing in two years time</mark>"
2564,<mark> That is why £9</mark>
2565,<mark>7 billion wasted on PPE is so shocking</mark>
2566,<mark> 1 priority</mark>
2567,"<mark> I believe that, starting from scratch, only 1% of certain PPE products were actually made in this country and over the course of the pandemic that has been increased to 70%plus</mark>"
2568,"<mark>As someone with a large Northern Irish population in Wolverhampton, and being half Northern Irish myself, I have grave concerns about the constitutional crisis that the protocol is causing</mark>"
2569,"<mark>I sort of understand the point that the Leader of the House is making, but why should the public not just know Why should the public have to know about an ordinary MP going to the football or the cricket or whatever, and know the details of them receiving hospitality worth more than £300 within 28 days, but when it is a Minister, they do not have to know for months and months, and in some cases they never get to know the details at all</mark>"
2570,"<mark>Following on from what the Secretary of State has just said, is it not extraordinary that 20% of the checks that the EU has with third countries are between Great Britain and Northern Ireland It is even more crazy, because the vast majority of those goods are circulating within the UK single market</mark>"
2571,"<mark> Gentleman regularly, in that contribution, referred to £8</mark>"
2572,"<mark>7 billion or £9 billionrounding, if he wishes toas wasted</mark>"
2573,<mark> Can he tell me how much more could we have got for nurses for that £8</mark>
2574,<mark>7 billion My local nurses who are watching this statement are thinking that they could have done with that pay increase</mark>
2575,"<mark> They say, MPs get paid more than double the average wage,, Youre in the top 5% of earners,, Why isnt one job enough for you, and, When you take on second jobs, what on earth do you think the corporations are buying other than your influence and the letters MP</mark>"
2576,<mark> It was about 2 oclock on Wednesday 3 November when the Leader of the House got to his feet to approve the third report of the Committee on Standards</mark>
2577,"<mark> The ICGS set out very clearly that, based on the evidence we took, 80% of the problems we were suffering in this House were workplace grievance issues</mark>"
2578,"<mark> Yes, 20% were very serious bullying and sexual harassment issues, but nevertheless we have a culture issue, and the ICGS set out to change that</mark>"
2579,<mark> Article 9 states that everything else is subsidiary to us</mark>
2580,<mark> We have given £8 billion of support to the sector</mark>
2581,"<mark> We have more than doubled the number of tests available for HGV drivers in a normal week from 1,500 weekly appointments precovid to 3,200 in a normal week now</mark>"
2582,"<mark>My Department has passed legislation paving the way for space flight and satellite launches from UK soil, and we have already awarded £40 million of grants to kickstart capability</mark>"
2583,"<mark> Obviously, that means that 3% was not</mark>"
2584,<mark> Paragraph 5</mark>
2585,"<mark> Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland Mr Carmichael, the UK Statistics Authority confirmed that, if fraud and computer misuse are counted, as they should be, total crime in fact increased by 14% between the year ending September 2019 and the year ending September 2021</mark>"
2586,"<mark> With the new rules on slots, we have the prospect of planes flying empty or with half loads</mark>"
2587,"<mark> The UK Government think that there is no sense in such an approach, and our own future border arrangements will be based on a calibrated assessment of risk, not on an arbitrary percentage figure plucked out of the sky</mark>"
2588,"<mark>Private Eye has uncovered £600 million of PPE contracts awarded to Unispace Global, an interior design company, through the VIP lane</mark>"
2589,"<mark> The Department has paid the money to Unispace but it is not shown on the company accounts, so will the Minister strain every sinew and will there be an investigation to account for the £600 million of public money</mark>"
2590,"<mark> If the gambling industry gave gifts or provided hospitality to a Back Bencher or Committee Chair, that Member would have to declare it within 28 days if it was worth more than £250, so tickets to the horseracing, with a hospitality box with food and drink, would have to be declared within 28 days</mark>"
2591,<mark> She will no doubt also be aware of paragraph 8</mark>
2592,"<mark> If fraud and computer misuse are counted in total crime as they should be, total crime in fact increased by 14% between the year ending September 2019 and the year ending September 2021</mark>"
2593,"<mark> 83A7,</mark>"
2594,<mark> Everybody can see how many people want to contribute and the windingup speech will start at 8</mark>
2595,<mark>We will begin the windup speeches at 8</mark>
2596,<mark>To resume his seat at 8</mark>
2597,<mark>With this it will be convenient to consider Lords amendment 2</mark>
2598,<mark> On the envelope was a customs stamp with a customs fee of £3a customs fee of £3 to send a Christmas card from one member of a family in one part of the United Kingdom to another member of the family in another part of the United Kingdom</mark>
2599,"<mark> It is frightening that in the months between April and November last year over 90,000 women who might have breast cancer were not seen by a specialist within the target of 14 days of being urgently referred by a GP, and that this year half a million people with suspected cancer will  wait longer than the supposed twoweek maximum to see an oncologist</mark>"
2600,"<mark> I know he is aware of the enormous unharnessed potential of hightech radiotherapy as a solution to timecritical cancer backlogs, but it still receives only 5% of the cancer budget</mark>"
2601,"<mark> They deteriorate, often very quickly, and every single one of the 6 million people on the waiting list will have to rely on their GP for extra appointments and extra treatment, and they will possibly rely on their GP to deal with severe complications</mark>"
2602,"<mark>There is no question but that the waiting list is impacting on my constituents quality of life, but I fail to see how taking £36 billion out of the system would help</mark>"
2603,<mark>The Minister will be aware of the shocking 77% rise in the number of children needing specialist mental health care for suicidal thoughts and selfharm between 2019 and 2021</mark>
2604,"<mark> 1 issue, but their staff simply cannot cope with the numbers and severity of need</mark>"
2605,<mark>I appreciate the fact that 2 million people have been added to waiting lists throughout the pandemicit is foolish to try to pretend that that has not made a big differenceand I also appreciate the Governments £12 billionayear plan to help to address the situation</mark>
2606,"<mark> I know that that is not what anybody means, so may we completely change that language As I understand it, the Prime  Minister has also announced another cancer target today to get to 75% of all cancer diagnoses being made at stage 1 or stage 2</mark>"
2607,"<mark> The number of people waiting for care in England now stands at about 6 million, and we know that that figure will get worse before it gets better</mark>"
2608,"<mark> Furthermore, our best current estimate is that about 8</mark>"
2609,<mark>5 million people who would normally come forward for treatment have not done so during the pandemic</mark>
2610,<mark> Members will be aware that the Government will have invested more than £8 billion in the NHS in the three years from 202223 to 202425</mark>
2611,"<mark> We want to ensure that 75% of patients are diagnosed or have cancer ruled out within 28 days of a GP referral, and to return the backlog of people waiting more than two months for their cancer treatment to prepandemic levels by March 2023</mark>"
2612,"<mark> As he said, 2 million of those on the waiting list have entered that waiting list since the pandemic began</mark>"
2613,"<mark>9 billion increase in funding, enshrined in law</mark>"
2614,"<mark>7% of prepandemic levels in the latest month for which I have statistics, which is November 2021</mark>"
2615,<mark> In October 2021 there were thousands more doctors and thousands more nurses in our NHS compared with October 2020</mark>
2616,<mark> We went into the pandemic with NHS waiting lists already at a record 4</mark>
2617,"<mark>5 million, and now 6 million people are waiting on those listsmore than ever before</mark>"
2618,"<mark> More than 1 million are waiting for scans and tests used to diagnose cancer, and the NHS itself is waitingwaiting for the Governments plan to deal with the backlog</mark>"
2619,<mark> Strand 1 details the envisioned daytoday functioning of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive</mark>
2620,"<mark> I bookended my trip with a visit to Clonard monastery on the Falls Road, where I listened to an engaging talk with the Northern Irish boxer Carl Frampton, and with a moving service yesterday at St Matthews on the  Shankill Road, with a sermon from the Archbishop of Canterburyall part of the 4 Corners festival, bringing together all that unites Belfast and, indeed, wider Northern Irelandled by Father Martin Magill, a Catholic priest on the Falls, and the Rev</mark>"
2621,"<mark> 83F, That this House agrees with Lords amendment 1</mark>"
2622,"<mark> To do that, for example, there is more than £1 billion of funding in the spending review for disability employment</mark>"
2623,"<mark> The Office for National Statistics highlighted back in November last year that, tragically, only 25% of autistic adults are in any form of   meaningful employment despite record job vacancies</mark>"
2624,<mark> Friend agree that much of what the Opposition have said here today would be better directed down the M4 towards their Welsh Labour colleagues</mark>
2625,<mark> I am therefore reassured that we  have seen a 21% increase in nursing applications in the past year alone</mark>
2626,<mark>A poll by the Fawcett Society reported that a quarter of employees currently experiencing the menopause said they would consider leaving the workforce</mark>
2627,"<mark> Furthermore, 10% are actually doing so</mark>"
2628,"<mark> Donaldson, in frustration, revealed that the Prime Minister told him that the current protocol negotiations have only a 30% chance of success</mark>"
2629,"<mark> I had gone before Christmas to join the collection of the Black Santa appeal, and I was there yesterday when those involved revealed that they had raised more than £150,000</mark>"
2630,"<mark> Surely we have to learn the lesson that politicians are elected to go to work, to be at their desk to deal with the problems, and to sit down and work together to solve the problems on behalf of the people</mark>"
2631,"<mark> Friend is a champion in this House for Scunthorpe General Hospital, and since her election she has never ceased to lobby, politely but firmly, on its behalf</mark>"
2632,"<mark>I beg to move, That this House agrees with Lords amendment 1</mark>"
2633,"<mark> To ensure that there is no ambiguity over whether the provisions of the legislation apply, Lords amendment 1 allows for the relevant provisions in the Bill to apply retrospectively if Royal Assent coincides with the resignation of a First Minister, thus triggering the existing sevenday Executive formation period</mark>"
2634,"<mark> Gentleman, but I must remind the House, lest he be tempted to take too many interventions, that we have only one hour for thisuntil 8</mark>"
2635,<mark> Those commitments were made on behalf of the Government by the right hon</mark>
2636,"<mark> However, they said that in their Command Paper over six months ago, and in those six months the cost to Northern Ireland businesses has exceeded well over half a billion pounds</mark>"
2637,"<mark> It has superseded article 6 of the Act of Union itself, which makes provision for free trade within our own country</mark>"
2638,"<mark>Research from the House of Commons Library shows that in my constituency, electricity and gas prices are up by £741 a year, the petrol price is up by 22%, and food costs have risen by £100 a year</mark>"
2639,<mark> Does the Minister really think that this is the time to be hiking national insurance contributions by 1</mark>
2640,<mark>25%</mark>
2641,"<mark> Last week the Tories took the side of the bankers, voting to hand them a tax cut worth £1 billion a year</mark>"
2642,<mark> Last night they voted to slash social security for millions of people by roughly 4% in real terms</mark>
2643,"<mark> Then, just a few days later, they gave the green light to energy bills soaring by nearly £700</mark>"
2644,"<mark> They scrap the £20 a week universal credit uplift, but hand contracts worth £880 million to a handful of Tory donors</mark>"
2645,"<mark> They allow Britains billionaires to add an extra £106 billion to their fortunes in the pandemic, but stand idly by as poverty gets worse and worse, with nearly 5 million children now in poverty, including around 7,000 in Coventry South</mark>"
2646,"<mark> That is what the French are doingnot letting bills soar by 54% like our Government, but capping the rise at just 4%</mark>"
2647,<mark> Does she agree that it is an outrage that this Government have just voted for a realterms cut to social security and pension payments while giving the bankers a £1 billion tax cut</mark>
2648,"<mark> However, the £4</mark>"
2649,"<mark>3 billion in covid loans written off by the Treasury as wasted money,  the £37 billion wasted on track and trace and the Government contracts given to their mates are all unacceptable</mark>"
2650,"<mark>I was pleased to contribute to last weeks debate on rising energy prices, shortly after which the energy price cap was increased by 54%, adding more financial woe to millions of families across the country</mark>"
2651,"<mark> Both energy insecurity and food insecurity are related to the dramatic increase in inflation over which the Government have presided, which is now a painful concern to millions of peoplefact</mark>"
2652,"<mark> In 2014, the coalition Government continued their deep cuts to state support, and the United Nations found that 8</mark>"
2653,<mark>4 million people were living in households in which someone did not have enough to eat</mark>
2654,"<mark>5 million threeday emergency food parcels across the country, and 40% of them were for children</mark>"
2655,"<mark> There is also the tearing up of the social security net, which millions relied on to provide the bare minimum, and the slashing of funding for local authorities that try to cope on the frontline</mark>"
2656,"<mark>25% increase in national insurance is, in effect, an 8% increase in totalnot 1</mark>"
2657,<mark>25%</mark>
2658,<mark> I am talking about a windfall tax on the big oil and gas companies; taxing wealth at the same rates as work to raise billions towards a permanent uplift to universal credit; and an end to austerity in the public services that we all rely on when times are so hard</mark>
2659,"<mark> The cost of everyday and essential food items, on which millions of lowpaid families depend, are soaring even faster than the headline rate of inflation</mark>"
2660,"<mark> As campaigner Jack Monroe explained on Good Morning Britain, the cheapest rice at one supermarket was 45p for a kilogram this time last year and it is now £1 for half that</mark>"
2661,"<mark> That is a 344% increase, hitting the poorest and most vulnerable households the hardest</mark>"
2662,<mark> A can of baked beans has gone up by 45% and bread by 29%</mark>
2663,"<mark> I am proud of the efforts of the British people in supporting one another, and many of us have stood shoulder to shoulder with them, while at least one Government Member was earning £1,400 an hour helping tax havens to take on the UK Government</mark>"
2664,"<mark>Just to give everyone an indication, a lot of people are trying to catch my eye and I anticipate that we will start the windup speeches no later than 4</mark>"
2665,"<mark> There will be 10 minutes then for each Front Bencher, and the switchover for those wanting to take part in the next debate should be no later than 4</mark>"
2666,"<mark> Every single person on these islands faces a cost of around £1,200 as a result of Brexit, and we know who will be hit the hardest</mark>"
2667,"<mark>I wonder what it says about the Governments global Britain image around the world when they send Ministers away on their £500,000 jets</mark>"
2668,<mark> Spending among the poorest 20% of households has been broadly stable for the last 14 years</mark>
2669,"<mark> Since 2008,  between 14% and 17% of the expenditure of the poorest households has been on food and nonalcoholic drinks, while the average household has spent between 10% and 12% of its income on food</mark>"
2670,<mark> There has been a gradual decrease in expenditure as a percentage both for the lowest 20% by income and for all households</mark>
2671,"<mark> During the pandemic, we put in place a £170 million covid winter grant scheme, with 80% earmarked to provide support with food and bills</mark>"
2672,"<mark> While the average percentage of adults living with obesity or excess weight is 62% in England, it is 72</mark>"
2673,<mark>8% in StokeonTrent</mark>
2674,"<mark>If we have a look at the grotesque inequality in this country, and at those who have and those who have not, we see that there has been a 500% increase in the number of billionaires since covid began, a £2 trillion increase in FTSE stock market value and £3 trillion increase in housing stock</mark>"
2675,"<mark> They lost £80 a month due to that Government cut, and their energy prices had already risen by £95 a month</mark>"
2676,"<mark> Membership of that charity has grown by 270% in the past year, which shows just how much the levels of food insecurity have increased</mark>"
2677,"<mark> The Government have said that they want to reduce inequalities in healthy life expectancy, but that is impossible when 1 million adults go whole days without eating, and 9% of the population are experiencing food insecurity</mark>"
2678,"<mark> The paper quite rightly says to the Government on behalf of those babies born in Salford and other northern cities in 2022, Dont leave us Behind</mark>"
2679,"<mark> We reached more than 2,000 households across Swansea last Christmas, and even that was probably not enough</mark>"
2680,"<mark>7 million Britons struggling to feed themselves, Deluge of families facing homelessness and Fears people will freeze to death at home as energy bills rocket</mark>"
2681,"<mark> Their 2yearold had never tasted a fresh potato, let alone Brussels and parsnips</mark>"
2682,"<mark> At the same time, they are paying, on average, £155 extra in national insurance contributions</mark>"
2683,<mark> Was it not this Conservative Government who introduced the national living wage in 2016 Was it not this Conservative Government who raised the national living wage to £9</mark>
2684,<mark>50 this year Stourbridge has seen a 28% drop in the adult claimant rate and a 40% drop in the youth claimant rate since last March</mark>
2685,"<mark> Dont take my word for itjust look at our record over the past decade an effective £1,000 tax cut to 2 million lowincome people on universal credit; a council tax rebate for over 86% of households in the west midlands; fuel duty frozen for the past 10 years</mark>"
2686,<mark> All households will receive a £200 rebate on their energy bills this year</mark>
2687,<mark> Eight million pensioners benefit from the £2 billion winter fuel payment scheme</mark>
2688,"<mark> More than 2 million lowincome households receive a £140 rebate on energy bills as part of the warm home discount, and 4 million vulnerable households receive cold weather payments</mark>"
2689,"<mark> We are a Government who are committed to supporting lowincome families, spending £110 billion on welfare support for people of working age in 202122 to ensure that the lowest paid are supported</mark>"
2690,<mark> Millions of the most vulnerable in our society are receiving billions of pounds in support from the Government</mark>
2691,"<mark> That is because millions of people across the UK are experiencing food insecurity, including an estimated 1</mark>"
2692,<mark>8 million of school age</mark>
2693,"<mark> So it is unfortunate that 11% of pupils eligible for free school meals in the northeast currently do not even claim that support, often due to the fact that it is a complex process and some are unaware of their entitlement</mark>"
2694,<mark> Introducing that one recommendation would be a simple step that would make a huge difference to hundreds of thousands of families across the country and put right some of the inadequacies of the free school meals system</mark>
2695,<mark>5 million children in Britain are at risk of malnutrition as a result of living in poverty</mark>
2696,<mark> Research by the Food Foundation in 2020 showed that 20% of adults in the UKaround 11 millionface food insecurity each year</mark>
2697,"<mark> The time for sticking plasters, such as a reliance on thousands of food bank and pantry volunteers and donors, is over</mark>"
2698,"<mark> If we accept the universal and compulsory requirement that all children up to the age of 16 should be in school, why do we break from that principle of universal care, nurturing and protection in relation to their meals during the day What a difference that would make to the 4</mark>"
2699,<mark>5 million children going hungry today</mark>
2700,"<mark> The Welsh Labour Government have just doubled the warm homes discount, and Labours plan would see the worstoff in society receive £600 to support them in paying their energy billsreal support, not words on a piece of paper or a loan to be paid off in the distant future</mark>"
2701,"<mark> The Trussell Trust recently revealed that food banks in its network distributed at least three parcels every minute of every day between April and September last year, which was an 11% increase on the same period in 2019</mark>"

2703,"<mark> Some £15 was added to the price of groceries last month, with the rate of food price increases set to soar further this year, just as national insurance contributions are set to rise</mark>"
2704,<mark> Trussell Trust data shows that 62% of workingage adults using food banks are disabled</mark>
2705,<mark> The Food Foundation says that levels of food insecurity are 12% higher for households with a disabled person</mark>
2706,"<mark> Prepandemic, the figure was half that</mark>"
2707,"<mark> Disabled people did not even get the £20 universal credit uplift, and they are suffering even more during this cost of living crisis</mark>"
2708,<mark> They have provided £65 million in direct financial support to over half a million households</mark>
2709,<mark> Relative poverty in Blackburn has jumped by more than 25% since 2014</mark>

2712,<mark>5 million food parcels were handed out to our fellow citizensup from just thousands in 2010</mark>

2715,"<mark>5 million people in insecure work, with terrible contracts that mean that they do not know how much they are going to earn from one month to the next</mark>"
2716,"<mark> Even worse, the Office for Budget Responsibility is telling us that 18% of people, nearly one in five in this country, are working below their skill level</mark>"
2717,"<mark> As I mentioned, 3</mark>"
2718,<mark>5 million people are in insecure work; that cannot go on</mark>
2719,"<mark>And then we look at the other end of the political spectrum, where we see 14 million people in this country, the sixth richest economy on this planet, living in poverty</mark>"
2720,<mark> I think we will all probably have experienced being behind the person in the local newsagent who has the key to put £5 on their electricity bill</mark>
2721,"<mark>Mr Deputy Speaker, that has taken out a minute and a half of my time, but thank you very much for allowing me to continue</mark>"
2722,<mark> We live in a countrythe sixth richest economy in the worldwhere we have 4</mark>
2723,"<mark>3 million kids living in poverty, and we have 14 million people living in poverty</mark>"
2724,"<mark> It does not matter how or what we claim about poverty, and it does not matter whether we have reduced it by 1 million or whatever</mark>"
2725,"<mark> If we have millions of people in poverty, we should be bloody well ashamed of ourselves</mark>"
2726,"<mark> Is it not really embarrassing to this country when we have chief executives of energy companies, which have just made $40 billion in the last few weeks, suggesting that it is not bragging to say their companies are like cash machines What does that make people in poverty feel And we introduce a Buy now, pay later scheme and think that is enough support</mark>"
2727,"<mark> To help the lowest paid people do that, we are increasing the national living wage to £9</mark>"
2728,"<mark> That represents an extra £1,000 a year for a fulltime worker</mark>"
2729,"<mark> Nearly 2 million families on low incomes will benefit from £1,000 a year through the cut in the universal credit taper and increases to work allowances</mark>"

2732,"<mark> In my constituency, there are 1,800 people on unemploymentrelated benefits</mark>"
2733,"<mark> It is also important to recognise the direct support through the half a billion pound household support fund to help lowincome households with the cost of food and other essentials, as well as the increase in the value of Healthy Start food vouchers, which the Minister referred to</mark>"

2737,"<mark> The people of this country are being ignored while Downing Street is in despair first, there is the cost of living crisis on food, energy bills and goods; secondly, the universal credit   cut, cutting the income of 6 million families; and, finally, putting up taxes on working people and businesses, leaving us with the biggest tax burden for 70 years</mark>"
2738,<mark> The national insurance rise in April will cost the average household £600 a year more</mark>

2746,"<mark>7 million adults had experienced food insecurity, and National Energy Action estimates that 6 million households in these islands will be living in fuel poverty that is not having to cut back slightly,  but being unable to keep themselves warm enough to be safe and healthy, or to feed themselves and their families enough to keep healthy</mark>"
2747,<mark> The poorest families will spend 18% of their income on energy bills after April</mark>
2748,"<mark> Members imagine spending 18% of their £80,000ayear salary on fuel bills This place would be in uproar if that happened</mark>"

2754,<mark> That figure of £3</mark>
2755,"<mark>9 billion is £361 million above the level of funding that we get from the UK Government, so while again the Tories will demand guarantees that all of the money that comes to Scotland be used for its intended purpose, the Scottish Government are spending almost 10% more than they are receiving for that purpose</mark>"
2756,"<mark> In fact, on pensions, during my time as an MP we have seen this British Government betray their promises to millions of WASPI women, betray their promises on the pensions triple lock and free TV licences, and underpay more than £1 billion in pensions to over 130,000 pensioners</mark>"
2757,<mark> Last year they also failed to pay tens of thousands of pensioners their pensions at all after they had reached state pension age</mark>
2758,"<mark>Does the Minister agree that there is no reason why we should not produce 100% of the temperate food that we need We lost a huge amount of market share when the common agricultural policy was introduced, and some of us want to get that back now that we are out of the CAP</mark>"
2759,"<mark> For example, there is the £500 million household support fund, which is going to provide food, utilities and essentials for some of the most vulnerable in our society; the £110 billionI repeat, £110 billionthat this Government spend each and every year on welfare; increasing the value of Healthy Start food vouchers; the £220 million on our holiday activities and food programme for disadvantaged children, helping vulnerable families; and, of course, this Governments commitment to ending hunger by 2030</mark>"

2795,<mark> A can of baked beans has gone up by 45% and bread by 29%</mark>
2796,<mark> It is important to remember that the Treasury spent £400 billion on direct economic support during the pandemic</mark>
2797,<mark> Universal credit has been a vital safety net for about 6 million people during this time</mark>

2816,"<mark> Most in the House agree in principle with the transition from the basic payment scheme to environmental land management schemes, but the botching of the transition means that farmers lost between 5% and 25% of their income in December, and most of them will see a decline to nothing before they are able to access anything like an equivalent amount of money through the ELMS</mark>"

2827,"<mark> Some 60% of the food we now consume is produced in the UK, which is great</mark>"
2828,"<mark> On behalf of my farmers, I would very much welcome the Minister looking at the devolved Administrations impact on UK food security and working with Welsh Government Ministers to protect areas of Montgomeryshire, make sure we have the most sustainable farming in the world and get local miles down as far as possible</mark>"
2829,"<mark> If we look at the foods we can produce here, it remains healthy at 70%, and that has been stable for the past 20 years or so</mark>"
2830,"<mark> We are close to 100% selfsufficient in poultry, eggs, carrots and swedes, for example</mark>"
2831,"<mark> Fruit production has fallen to 16% of what we consume nationally, and fruit is one of the very few foodstuffs whose price has risen in comparative terms over the last 10 years when the price of most other foodstuffs has fallen</mark>"

2839,"<mark> In addition, the UK is home to 30% of European common seals, which are, sadly, in alarming decline</mark>"
2840,"<mark> They are covered by the 1979 Bern Convention, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee recognises that the UK has a special responsibility to protect seals on behalf of the rest of the world</mark>"
2841,"<mark> That runs alongside chronic underfunding and devaluing of public health, huge gaps in the workforce and wholly inadequate social care provision, with more than 500,000 people waiting for assessment and hundreds of thousands more denied access to care of any kind because the barrier for access is far too high</mark>"
2842,"<mark> The Select Committee on Health and Social Care recommended an increase of £7 billion a year by the end of the Parliament, but it is actually going up by £2 billion a year</mark>"
2843,"<mark> With a record 6 million patients waiting for planned NHS treatment across the UK, can the Minister explain how we will tackle the crisis in waiting times through this White Paper</mark>"
2844,"<mark> With thousands of NHS vacancies and thousands of social care vacancies, we really need to address that issue</mark>"
2845,"<mark> While Scotlands workforce has grown by 20% under the SNP, Brexit is still hampering our ability to recruit from EU nations</mark>"
2846,"<mark> This year, one million people will be supported by digitally enabled care pathways in the comfort of their home</mark>"

2853,"<mark> We warned that tens of millions of Afghans faced imminent starvation, including millions of children</mark>"

2856,"<mark> Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston Preet Kaur Gill What representations has she made to free up the $1</mark>"

2858,<mark>We hear an awful lot in this place about global Britainwhere is global Britain now The harsh Afghan winter has already set in and the United Nations estimates that only 5% of Afghans have enough good food to eat each day</mark>
2859,"<mark> As a former military stakeholder, the UK has a moral obligation to support the wellbeing of Afghan people, so why can the FCDO not find a fraction of that £28 billion to support the UNs emergency famine appeal So far, the UK Government have not given anything to the appeal</mark>"
2860,<mark> The UK has committed a mere £286 million and only given £176 million of that to date</mark>
2861,"<mark> That is what is leading to extreme poverty, mass malnutrition and a million children close to starvation</mark>"
2862,"<mark>, but clearly voices from across the House are saying, Everything is not all right, and you had at least four months when you were warned about this humanitarian crisis affecting millions of people in Afghanistan</mark>"
2863,"<mark> If we can commit £30 billion to a military project such as Afghanistan, it is obscene that we cannot commit more than 5% in foreign aid to rebuilding that country and saving as many lives as we can, having invested so much over so long</mark>"
2864,"<mark> Member for Bolton South East Yasmin Qureshi, who is no longer in her place, referred to the former Member for Penrith and The Border and the need for at least 5% funding immediately</mark>"
2865,"<mark> It is good to know that 4 million people are being helped, but there are probably 37 million people facing starvation at this very moment, and they will continue to face starvation unless we see the reconstruction of the Afghan economy</mark>"
2866,<mark>Successive Governments have committed United Kingdom forces to Afghanistan and we have spent billions of pounds</mark>
2867,"<mark> We now have a situation where millions of people are starving, and we must cut through the bureaucracy and get food to people, because otherwise they will starve to death</mark>"
2868,"<mark> In January, the UN requested nearly $4</mark>"
2869,<mark>5 billion for 2022the largest humanitarian appeal on record</mark>
2870,"<mark> On 28 January 2022, the Foreign Secretary announced £97 million of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan from the UK</mark>"
2871,"<mark> This latest allocation of vital support delivers the Prime Ministers promise to double the aid to Afghanistan, to £286 million</mark>"
2872,"<mark> By the end of January 2022, we had disbursed over £176 million in aid, and will disburse the remainder by the end of this financial yearthat is, the end of March</mark>"
2873,"<mark>47 million people get emergency food assistance through the World Food Programme, and will provide 6</mark>"
2874,"<mark>1 million people with emergency health, water, protection, shelter and food, through the UN Afghanistan humanitarian fund</mark>"
2875,"<mark> On 27 January, the UK Government laid legislation to implement UN security Council resolution 2615</mark>"
2876,<mark> The £286 million that we have promised will be spent by the end of this financial year</mark>
2877,"<mark> As I said last month, we are also working to encourage the World Bank, as a matter of urgency, to repurpose the Afghanistan reconstruction trust fund, which would unlock a further $1</mark>"
2878,<mark>5 billion</mark>
2879,"<mark>It is extremely important, when we talk about such a tragic situation, that we get the facts right about what the UK Government are doing on behalf of the British people</mark>"
2880,"<mark> We have announced and already spent more than £176 million of aid, which is supporting more than 60 hospitals, providing health services to more than 300,000 people, ensuring that more than 4 million people are getting emergency food assistance and providing 6</mark>"
2881,"<mark>1 million people with emergency health, water and protection</mark>"
2882,"<mark> As promised, by the end of this financial year, at the end of March, our aid will have reached £286 million</mark>"

2885,"<mark>As I have said already, the UK funding is providing food aid to 4</mark>"
2886,<mark>47 million people</mark>
2887,"<mark> The UK has stepped up for over 4 million people, and we need others also to step up more</mark>"
2888,<mark> That is supporting 4</mark>
2889,"<mark>4 million people at the moment, and as I have said, this will go up to 6</mark>"
2890,"<mark>6 million when we include the support we are also putting in for health, water, protection, shelter and so on</mark>"
2891,"<mark>As I have already said from this Dispatch Box, the aid we have allocated since October is supporting 4</mark>"
2892,"<mark>47 million people to get emergency food assistance through the World Food Programme, as well as supporting 60 hospitals and 300,000 people with health services</mark>"
2893,"<mark> Since Operation Pitting ended, we have also supported more than 3,000 people to leave Afghanistan or to move from third countries to the UK, so we are continuing to help relocate people</mark>"
2894,<mark> Significant crossGovernment effort has been under  way to ensure that the thousands of Afghans who have been evacuated to the UK receive the support they need to rebuild their lives</mark>

2897,"<mark> We are currently focused on ensuring that our committed  funds are getting to the 4 millionplus people we are supporting with food aid and other aid, encouraging the return of girls to education when schools go back in March, and doing everything we can to encourage the international community to step forward and address the current situation, which is indeed very serious</mark>"
2898,"<mark> On 25 Januarya couple of weeks agothe UK also supported the Asian Development Bank with a £405 million support package for the Afghan people, funded from the Asian Development Fund</mark>"

2900,"<mark> We have supported some 3,400 people to leave Afghanistan since the end of Operation Pitting, including 700 British nationals and eligible dependants</mark>"
2901,"<mark>The money that we have already announced is providing over 6 million people not only with food but with health, water, protection, shelter and so on</mark>"
2902,"<mark> We continue to be a leading donor with the money we have contributed so far, which is helping the 4 million</mark>"
2903,<mark> It is many millions of people</mark>
2904,<mark> The UKs aid is currently providing food for over 4</mark>
2905,<mark>4 million people</mark>
2906,"<mark> This is not science fiction; these are facts, attested to by British journalists and charities working on the ground while the World Food Programme is trying desperately to feed 20 million starving people</mark>"
2907,<mark> Five million are living in camps</mark>
2908,"<mark> Four million are just over the border in Iran, and they will not stay there; they will be heading for Europe and for Britain before long</mark>"
2909,<mark> UN professionals have made clear that $4</mark>
2910,"<mark>4 billion is required, and, typically, fair burdensharing would mean that the UK would agree to provide about 10% of that</mark>"
2911,"<mark> As Britains International Development Secretary, I spent half my time urging, pleading and cajoling my counterparts in the rich world to step up to the plate</mark>"
2912,"<mark> I do not think the Minister understands that tens of millions of people will starve to death in Afghanistan unless she steps up and meets the need, economically and politically, to put in the resolution that we need</mark>"
2913,<mark>It is estimated that the war in Afghanistan cost the US $2 trillion</mark>
2914,<mark> The same BBC report indicates that the UK cost was $1</mark>
2915,<mark>5 billion per annum</mark>
2916,<mark> The Minister says that the UK Government are committed to spending £286 million this year</mark>
2917,"<mark> Today, over 65% of premises can access gigabitcapable networks, but we have ambitions to do much more, precisely because we want to ensure that a more profound digital divide does not emerge</mark>"

2924,"<mark> Instead, the situation has been epitomised by Tory donors receiving billions of pounds in contracts, Ministers losing mobile phones when their Department and the law have tried to find out what has gone on, and decent companies with great experience in this fieldI am thinking of Arco up in the northeastbeing left with next to nothing</mark>"

2927,"<mark> The Governments response was to hand it a second contract worth £350 million, again without competition</mark>"
2928,"<mark> I happen to think that the collective actions of the British public were indispensable in saving many, many thousands of lives</mark>"
2929,"<mark> We need to ensure that the clinically extremely vulnerable have access to them, and 1</mark>"

2941,"<mark> Yes, troop numbers are scheduled to reduce, but spending on defence is going up to a record amount, and an extra £24 billion over the comprehensive spending review period is not money to be sniffed at</mark>"
2942,"<mark> Given the reports of thousands of civilians being taken from their homes and taken to Russia as part of forced evacuationsa clear breach of article 49 of the Geneva conventioncan I ask the Secretary of State what discussions he and colleagues across Government have had about any future role for courts, including the International Criminal Court It is vital that perpetrators know that they will be held to account for their actions in future</mark>"

2951,"<mark> We learned today that 7 million carers will not get tests, and that money for tests for NHS and care staff will have to be found from within existing budgets, which makes waiting lists even more precarious</mark>"
2952,"<mark> Having made the decision to refocus our NHS this winter on the campaign to get boosted now, we were the first major European nation to boost half our population, too</mark>"
2953,"<mark> Over 71% of all adults in England are now boosted, including 93% of those aged 70 or over</mark>"
2954,"<mark> The testing, tracing and isolation budget in 202021 exceeded the entire budget of the Home Office; it cost a further £15</mark>"

2956,"<mark> The UK is also leading the way on antivirals and therapeutics, with our Antivirals Taskforce securing a supply of almost 5 million, which is more per head than any other country in Europe</mark>"
2957,"<mark> We will meet our commitment to donate 100 million vaccine doses by June, as our part of the agreement at the UKs G7 summit to provide a billion doses to vaccinate the world over the next year</mark>"
2958,"<mark> There are still millions of people who have not yet had their booster, and I urge them to get it</mark>"

2961,"<mark> Will he assure me that he will take personal responsibility for areas such as mine that have a booster rate of only 39%, to ensure continued vaccination in our community so that my constituents are not left behind in this rush to freedom</mark>"
2962,"<mark> Friend to cast his mind back to January last year, when Chris Whitty said that there will come a time when covid will be the same as flu, from which there are 7,000 to 20,000 deaths each year</mark>"
2963,"<mark> Now that we have excess deaths at minus 9% of what is normal at this time, is my right hon</mark>"
2964,<mark> The 1</mark>

2966,"<mark>First, I pay tribute to the work of UK Power Networks, which has been reconnecting people 247 over the weekend; they got me at 4 am on Saturday, for which I was very grateful</mark>"
2967,"<mark>Liberty is always better than the alternative, as long as everybody can share in that liberty equally, so the anxiety for some of us, especially those who represent very poor communities, is that if free testing is ended, those who are symptomatic may end up having to pay £59 or £119 for a PCR test</mark>"
2968,"<mark> People need to know that their liberties are returning and returning for good, but this is a halfbaked announcement from a Government paralysed by chaos and incompetence</mark>"

2984,"<mark> North Nottinghamshire has benefited greatly from £140 millionodd of investment through the towns fund, and a lot of it is going to skills and education, for which I am grateful</mark>"
2985,"<mark> We have heard today that 5,000 people are taking Tlevels this year; I have no idea whether there are more or fewer in the Truss for Leader camp, but at least I have been able to clarify the meaning of the Secretary of States badge</mark>"
2986,<mark> He will know that millions of people do not qualify  for SSP at the moment and that without financial support they cannot selfisolate</mark>
2987,"<mark> We are sending out 350,000 CO2 monitors and 9,000 air cleaning units; those are among the steps that we are taking to protect schools</mark>"
2988,"<mark>The aftermath of Storm Eunice and Storm Franklin has taught us what many in Shropshire and across the rest of the country already knew whenever a storm hits, the Government do not seem to be prepared to support the thousands of people in rural areas who are really badly affected</mark>"
2989,"<mark>May I add my condolences about the people who died during these storms Yesterday, hundreds of people in the northwest were forced to flee their homes as rivers burst their banks, and thousands more households remain without heating or electricity</mark>"
2990,"<mark> Tens of thousands of people across Northern Ireland have lost electricity, including some 500 people in one village in my Strangford constituency</mark>"
2991,"<mark>4 million homes without power, and Storm Arwen affected more than 1 million homes, including thousands in Aberdeenshire that were without power for well over a week</mark>"
2992,"<mark> What shortterm and longterm plans are being considered by the UK Government to strengthen our energy resilience and infrastructure Crucially, what is being done to ensure we do not see a repeat of last year, when thousands were without power for so long</mark>"
2993,"<mark> Continuing poor weather conditions have hampered those efforts, but I am pleased to say that, as of now, over 98% of those affected by the stormsmore than 1</mark>"
2994,<mark>4 million customershave had their power supply restored</mark>

3008,<mark> Member makes a really important point that is at the heart of our £100 million innovation accelerator pilot programme</mark>
3009,"<mark> Let us be more like Germany it has increased the number of manufacturing jobs by 1 million since 2010, whereas this Government have presided over a fall of 93,000 jobs</mark>"
3010,<mark> He will see that reflected in the allocation of £40 billion to UK Research and Innovation and Innovate UK in the next three years</mark>
3011,<mark> It needs just £24 million to do that</mark>
3012,<mark> I will address the specific point about tidal power we have just put £30 million into it</mark>
3013,"<mark>With the leave of the House, we shall take motions 7 and 8 together</mark>"
3014,"<mark> 1186,</mark>"
3015,"<mark> Our Department, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, which is responsible for 75% of RD, will move to  being 55% outside the southeast</mark>"
3016,<mark> The whole thrust of the 2025 celebrations come from that</mark>

3018,"<mark> 1 pub, with their historical significance</mark>"
3019,"<mark> As part of the same reform programme, we have asked the Office for Students to invest an additional £10 million in our worldleading specialist providers, many of which specialise in arts provision</mark>"
3020,"<mark> On providers losing funding in the reallocation as we send a clear message on STEM, I remind her that that income loss amounts to about 0</mark>"
3021,<mark>05% of those providers estimated total income</mark>

3023,"<mark>The national tutoring programme reached 308,000 pupils in 202021 and this year it is expanding further to offer high quality tuition for up to 2 million pupils across the country</mark>"
3024,"<mark>I know that the Secretary of State is as concerned as I am about children in my constituency reaching their full educational potential, but I am concerned that only 240,000 enrolled on the national tutoring programme in its first year, that it has only a third of the funding that his own Government adviser put forward for covid catchup and that funding per pupil will not reach 2010 levels for another three years</mark>"
3025,"<mark> It is going well in all parts of England, and provisional figures from our delivery partners show that so far this year 3,822 schools have engaged with the programme through the tuition partners and academic mentors</mark>"
3026,"<mark> On top of this, all schools are sharing the £579 million to recruit their own local tutors</mark>"
3027,"<mark> I need to reiterate that 95% of people who were affected now have their power back, but if someone is part of the 5% still without power, that is clearly no solace and will not help them in that situation</mark>"
3028,"<mark> On behalf of Llanwern steelworks, I send greetings to Shotton on its 125th birthday; Llanwern is considerably younger</mark>"
3029,"<mark> It is important that we celebrate this extremely important milestone for his constituency and for north Wales in general, so I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate and respond on behalf of the Government</mark>"
3030,"<mark> One reason is the history that he went through; it has been fascinating to hear about the contribution that Shotton has made for so long, the deeply embedded history within the community and the opportunities that Shotton has had over a century and a quarter</mark>"
3031,"<mark> Its contribution over such a long time includes producing millions of tonnes of steel sheet to build shelters for the population in the second world war, for example</mark>"
3032,<mark> Member for Alyn and Deeside as its constituency Member of Parliament since 2001</mark>
3033,<mark> 1337</mark>
3034,"<mark> I think it was talked about as long ago as November 1948, when there was a big discussion about whether iron ore should have been brought over from Birkenhead or sourced from elsewhere</mark>"
3035,"<mark> We had a steelworks back in the 1870s, a little before the right hon</mark>"
3036,"<mark> Gentlemans steelworks began, but it closed overnight in 1883, and all the activity was moved up to Cumbria</mark>"
3037,"<mark> However, I hope that the support that we have provided for energyintensive industries since 2013 has mitigated that to some extent, and we have confirmed that it will continue</mark>"
3038,"<mark> At least 7,000 homes in my constituency have been without power for between three and five nights</mark>"
3039,"<mark>When I looked at the Order Paper, I thought I might be making my speech at about 9 oclock or even later, so I am pleasantly surprised</mark>"
3040,"<mark> John Summers and Sons was now the largest manufacturer of galvanised steel in the country, with a site covering 60 acres and employing 3,000 workers</mark>"
3041,"<mark> The dispute came to end in December 1910, following a mass address to the workforce by Harry, who agreed to replace the ad hoc contract system with the direct payment of wagesprogress, indeed</mark>"
3042,"<mark> In the immediate postwar years, Shotton Steel maintained its success, with the workforce rising to some 5,800</mark>"
3043,"<mark> The period between the two world wars saw considerable change in both production techniques and global demand, with a general decline in demand for black and galvanised sheets, which at one time accounted for 98% of Shottons production</mark>"
3044,"<mark> Disruption continued during the great depression following the Wall Street crash and Black Friday, when two thirds of Shottons workers lost their jobs and the plant closed its doors, not to open again until 1933</mark>"
3045,<mark>2 million tons of black and galvanised sheets for various uses</mark>
3046,"<mark> Unlike in the first world war, women were now employed in the labs, packing departments and cranes, making up about 1,000 of the workforce</mark>"
3047,"<mark> At that time, steel consumption by the UK car industry had increased by 88%, creating a dramatic rise in demand</mark>"
3048,"<mark> Following several protests and backroom negotiations, led by the workers action committee, in May 1977 the British Steel Corporation removed proposals for the termination of iron and steelmaking at Shotton</mark>"
3049,"<mark> With trading prospects looking brighter, the review was put on hold until 1982</mark>"
3050,"<mark> Around 6,400 jobs were to be phased out following an agreement between the British Steel Corporation and trade unions</mark>"
3051,"<mark> As a result of only the second period of industrial action in its history, some 7,000 workers clocked off in December 1979, never to return other than for counselling</mark>"
3052,<mark> The heavy end closure was eventually complete in 1981</mark>
3053,"<mark> By the time the Corus Group was formed to run the Shotton plant in 1999, productivity had tripled compared with 1986 levels</mark>"
3054,"<mark> Corus was acquired by the Tata Steel group in 2007, and despite global financial challenges, the works remained profitable and forward thinking</mark>"
3055,<mark> A decade of Government indifference and failure to take action has caused the UK steel industry to nosedive by a fiftha £1 billion hit to our economy</mark>
3056,"<mark> Since 2010, UK steel production has plummeted by 21</mark>"
3057,"<mark>5%, which is 20 times the average among other European countries</mark>"
3058,<mark> When we compare our gas and electricity prices with those in other countriesthey are 60% cheaper in Germany and 51% cheaper in Franceit is a miracle that we have a steel industry at all</mark>
3059,"<mark> On behalf of the many who have suffered, I want to ask him a few questions</mark>"
3060,"<mark> In fact, it has sustained more than 500 highvoltage faults, with more than 1,000 instances of damage to its network</mark>"
3061,"<mark> Indeed, as of 9 pm last night, 9,500 customers remained cut off from their supply, including 5,700 in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, 1,500 in Moray, 1,400 in my Angus constituency and 570 in Perthshire</mark>"
3062,"<mark> He will also appreciate that Electricity North West has done a reasonable job in restoring power to 95% of people affected, but clearly we want to work harder to make sure that those 6,000 or 7,000 people who are still off the grid can get their power back as soon as possible</mark>"
3063,"<mark> As I said, 95% of the people affected have got the power back</mark>"
3064,"<mark> In my constituency, unfortunately, the  number is still in the thousands</mark>"
3065,"<mark> We had the publication of the hydrogen strategy in August, the hydrogen business model is being consulted on, and the net zero hydrogen fund stands at nearly £0</mark>"
3066,<mark>25 billion</mark>
3067,"<mark>Just before the Minister moves on to procurement, may I say that it is disappointing that he does not seem to have taken on board the seriousness of the issue of energy costs They were 61% above those of our major competitors before any of the crises and conditions that we now face</mark>"
3068,"<mark> I attended a Youth4Climate conference in Milan, and obviously the conference of youth in Glasgow</mark>"
3069,"<mark> However, as of 8 oclock this morning, there were still 30,000 customers without power</mark>"
3070,<mark> Storm Arwen has left thousands of my constituents without power for several days</mark>
3071,"<mark> I also have a secondary school that is still without power, so several hundred children are not getting the education that they need</mark>"
3072,<mark> He has contacted several local businesses on my behalf</mark>
3073,"<mark> First, one of my rural surgeries has lost £10,000worth of flu vaccines due to the electricity going down and the fridges going off, which will affect its ability to roll that out</mark>"
3074,"<mark>I thank the Secretary of State for the statement and for meeting me yesterday to discuss the situation in High Peak where thousands of homes have been left without power since the weekend, including in places such as Buxton, ChapelenleFrith, Wash, Bagshaw, Sparrowpit, Wormhill, Peak Forest, Chinley, Hayfield and more</mark>"
3075,"<mark> Thankfully, that is now down to the hundreds, but those people are facing their fifth night without power</mark>"
3076,"<mark> Secondly, on isolation and communication, I have in my constituency an old peoples home that lost its electricity at 2 oclock on Saturday morning and had it restored on Monday afternoon</mark>"
3077,"<mark> Member for Angus Dave Doogan, the numbers he produced earlier were from I think 9 oclock last night, but some numbers came out earlier today which show that, from the 9,500 customers who were still looking for power last night, it has come down to 6,400, 3,700 of those being in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, with areas such as Auchnagatt, Forglen, Methlick and New Byth coming on stream overnight</mark>"
3078,"<mark> They will be delighted, but of course there are still 3,700 in Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen city for whom that is not much solace, as the Secretary of State said</mark>"
3079,"<mark> I myself, in my constituency, had a very extreme case of flooding in 2014 and the issues she raised with regard to insurance and lessons learned are things I am very conscious of</mark>"
3080,"<mark> There were more than 2,000 signatures to the online petition in similar terms</mark>"
3081,"<mark> John Summers, born in the 1820s, ran a small business using one of the countrys first handheld rolling mills to roll puddled iron into crude steel sheets for clog nails</mark>"
3082,"<mark> Funding from the clean steel fund has been delayed until 2023 and, as I have said, the issue of high energy prices has been completely ignored</mark>"

3091,"<mark> Member for his question, which gives me the opportunity to remind him that his area is receiving hundreds of millions of pounds of investment in transport infrastructure</mark>"
3092,<mark>South Yorkshire will receive a share of the £5</mark>
3093,<mark>7 billion for transport for the region</mark>
3094,<mark> We are investing £2</mark>
3095,<mark>7 billion of capital funding to improve provision for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities</mark>
3096,<mark> That funding represents a significant investment in high needs provision and will help to deliver tens of thousands  of new places for some of the most vulnerable children in our country</mark>
3097,"<mark> Over the next three years, we will provide £259 million to expand the number of places available in secure and open residential childrens homes</mark>"
3098,"<mark> We promised to recruit an extra 20,000 police officers in 202223 and we are putting an extra £540 million into recruiting a further 8,000 additional police officers</mark>"
3099,<mark> We are allocating £42 million for new crime and drugs programmes</mark>
3100,"<mark> The covid pandemic has had a massive impact on this, so we are making an extra £2</mark>"
3101,<mark>2 billion available to manage the increased number of offenders being brought to justice and to reduce backlogs in criminal courts</mark>
3102,"<mark> There will be an extra 20,000 prison places, which builds on the additional 18,000 prison places that we announced at the last spending review, plus a further 2,000 temporary places</mark>"
3103,<mark> This Budget will provide billions of pounds to deliver the public services that the British people deserve</mark>
3104,<mark> The Budget is a clear statement of intent worldclass public services backed by £150 billion a year in cash terms</mark>
3105,"<mark>I am pleased that the Minister mentioned the opportunity to provide eight additional rebuilds of hospitals, because Stepping Hill Hospital has served the people of Stockport and surrounding areas well since it was built in 1905</mark>"
3106,"<mark> However, all hospital buildings reach the end of their useful lives and, with a £40 million maintenance bill, that one certainly has</mark>"
3107,"<mark> We have also provided £180 million in covid loan schemes to support businesses in Crawley and, as he knows, Crawley has already received £21 million through the towns fund</mark>"
3108,"<mark> I reassure him that the Department for Transport and Transport Scotland are discussing the options to extend the railway, and, as I think he knows, the £350 million Borderlands inclusive growth deal includes up to £5 million to assess feasibility</mark>"
3109,"<mark>First, may I put on record my thanks to the Chancellor for announcing that Radcliffe will receive £20 million from the levellingup fund to regenerate the town centre, with new leisure facilities and a space for adult learning and new business Following that extra funding and the previously announced new high school for Radcliffe, does the Minister agree that the Government are committed to creating new opportunities for young people so that they have the best chance to get on in life and fulfil their potential</mark>"
3110,"<mark> Friend, because his constituency is indeed receiving £20 million from the levellingup fund to deliver a new civic hub in Radcliffe, which will improve access to adult education while freeing up vital space for a new secondary school</mark>"
3111,"<mark> Gentleman recall that we set out to try to simplify the code of conduct Does he think we are succeeding in simplifying Or, by adding more, are we perhaps being drawn dangerously into a zerosum game, where rules beget rules and more rules beget more rules in an effort to try to clarify, and in fact making it more complicated I particularly draw attention to section 8 of the report, on Training, advice and promotion</mark>"
3112,"<mark>Regarding Russia, when I was in Bosnia as part of the United Nations protection force, a Russian man called Victor Andreev was very much part of the headquarters</mark>"
3113,"<mark> It seems that one of the problems, which has got worse since  my first visit in 2003 and my second in 2013, is that much as we would want to create a multiethnic, multidenominational constitution and structure, a lot of peoples daily lives are spent in a separate silo</mark>"
3114,"<mark>I was a young captain in 1997, when I deployed on my very first tour to Bosnia</mark>"
3115,"<mark> I also spent time in Banja Luka, which was then the headquarters of the multinational division that was entrusted with enforcing the peace and the Dayton agreement</mark>"
3116,"<mark> An estimated 100,000 people were killed, 80% of whom were Bosniaks</mark>"
3117,"<mark> In July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces killed as many as 8,000 Bosniak men and boys from the town of Srebrenica</mark>"
3118,"<mark> and gallant Friend the Member for Beckenham Bob Stewart deployed in 1992, in the act of peacemaking</mark>"
3119,<mark> I deployed in 1997</mark>
3120,"<mark> Why Because Dodiks rhetoric is separatist, and he has vowed to sever the legal and tax systems and the army in the Serbrun half of the country</mark>"
3121,<mark> Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton said that we are repeating the same mistakes as we did in the early 1990s</mark>
3122,"<mark> It is stoking the ethnic tensions and encouraging the separatists and the breakup of the state, because I imagine Putin regards it as in his national interest to see 1</mark>"
3123,<mark>8 million Bosnian refugees flooding into Europe when western Europe is already facing a refugee crisis</mark>
3124,"<mark> I agree with the suggestion that we should support the current headquarters in Bosnia with NATO troops, or even troops of support of the EU; it does not really matter, but an enhanced British presence in the headquarters and possibly on the ground is necessary to give us the eyes and the ears that we need</mark>"
3125,<mark> I deployed in 1997 to do peace enforcement; I think we now need to do political enforcement</mark>
3126,"<mark> As we all know, in 1995 Srebrenica experienced a genocide on a scale not seen in Europe since the second world war</mark>"
3127,"<mark> Eight thousand Muslim men and boys were murdered, women were raped, children were slain in front of their parents, and bodies were pushed into mass graves with the use of bulldozers</mark>"
3128,<mark> The Srebrenica massacre of 1995 was an atrocity</mark>
3129,<mark> The genocide of thousands of Muslim men and boysthe most horrific of eventsis now being dismissed and genocidedenial sentiments are rising among Republika Srpska factions</mark>
3130,"<mark> We must help them to get back to the pre1992 situation, when everyone worked together regardless of religion or ethnicity</mark>"
3131,"<mark> Member for Strangford Jim Shannon mentioned, we need to reform annexe 4 of the constitution to ensure that there is democratic accountability, and to give that confidence to people in the region and area</mark>"
3132,<mark> Member for Strangford Jim Shannon that he  had changed his position during the debates on the Irish question we had here in the 1990s and into the 2000s</mark>
3133,"<mark>As I mentioned, I sat through those debates and questions in the 1990s, and I am not prepared to sit through more months and years of prevarication</mark>"
3134,"<mark> But, to this day, not far away from where we stand, there are many people, and many countries backing people, who do deny what happened in 1995</mark>"
3135,"<mark> More than 8,000 Muslim men and boys were massacred, women were systematically raped and the lives of more than 100,000 people were taken in a war led by greed and inhumanity</mark>"
3136,"<mark> It would, in effect, enshrine the results of 1990s ethnic cleansing</mark>"
3137,"<mark> In the last few years, Putin has delivered semi automatic weapons to Republika Srpska2,500 to be exact, that we know of</mark>"
3138,"<mark> We know how to counter Russias disinformation and we should be doing more of it, so I urge the Minister to consider establishing a NATO counterdisinformation capability at NATO headquarters in Sarajevo</mark>"
3139,"<mark> As in the 1990s, bloodshed would displace thousands of people, and we would need to respond with boots on the ground</mark>"
3140,"<mark> My interest in that part of the world arises from the fact that, from 2000 to 2002, I worked with the United Nations mission in Kosovo after the NATO bombing of the former Yugoslavia</mark>"
3141,"<mark> Prior to 2000, the Serbians had come into Kosovo; I saw at first hand some of the atrocities that had been carried out by the Serbian Government in Kosovo</mark>"
3142,"<mark> After I came into Parliament in 2010, I got interested in Srebrenica in particular and founded the group with a Conservative Member</mark>"
3143,"<mark> Many of us will remember seeing images of the war in Bosnia during the 1990s, watching the horror of the footage of Sarajevo under siege and people being held in concentration camps, and slowly learning about the reports of the atrocities committed across Bosnia that culminated in genocide</mark>"
3144,<mark> The APPG was set up in 2013 with the purpose of commemorating Srebrenica and reminding us of those horrors</mark>
3145,"<mark> We cannot return to the violence and destruction of the 1990s, so it is important for the United Kingdom to start working together with our European partners and with others in the world to ensure that they do not happen again</mark>"
3146,"<mark> Bosnia has seen ongoing political violence since the early 1990s, and long before the Bosnian war of 1995</mark>"
3147,"<mark> First, Bosnia and Herzegovina is faced with thousands of migrants and asylum seekers wanting somewhere to live</mark>"
3148,"<mark> However, in this case, in 201819 only 1,223 of the 2,865 reported cases of domestic violence resulted in a court decisionthose figures worry me, as this is less than half</mark>"
3149,"<mark> Therefore, I suspectI do not have any evidential base to prove this, but I do not think I am far wrongthat many hundreds, if not thousands, more women are probably suffering at the hands of abusers but are too frightened to report it, given the ongoing human rights abuses</mark>"
3150,"<mark> Although more than 8,000 people died, there are nowhere near that many graves there, because a lot of the remains have not been found</mark>"
3151,"<mark> When we visit children in our own constituency, we might have helped their parents as asylum seekers and refugees in the late 1990s</mark>"
3152,"<mark> In the light of the comparison that he is making, it is worth stressing that there are similarities with the Good Friday agreement, which did lock in identity back in 1998, and to some extent, has not evolved, as Dayton also has not</mark>"
3153,"<mark> The Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocity Prevention Act 2018 commits the US Government to pursuing a Governmentwide strategy to identify, prevent and respond to atrocity risk</mark>"
3154,<mark> I visited in 2000 as a young undergraduate doing some charity work</mark>
3155,<mark> I am talking about the 1</mark>
3156,"<mark>8 million Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina who will surely find their way in that situation towards other parts of Europe and towards our own shores,  rather than being able to build their current and future lives in their own country</mark>"
3157,"<mark> I therefore pay tribute to all those across the whole region who have done so much to maintain peace since 1995, and I defer to the position of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office</mark>"
3158,"<mark> She took me to the Government headquarters, and I was making polite conversation with her</mark>"
3159,<mark> I asked her simply what the civil war in the early 1990s meant for her</mark>
3160,"<mark> It was estimated that some 23,000 women, children and elderly people were put on buses and driven to Muslimcontrolled territory, while, as others have said, 8,000plus battleage men were detained and killed</mark>"
3161,<mark> We need to uphold the provisions of the Dayton peace agreement that was signed in November 1995</mark>
3162,"<mark> Friend for sharing that because I remember visiting the Srebrenica memorial in 2015, and two Serbian young men driving past in their car with music blaring, throwing bottles of urine into the memorial</mark>"
3163,"<mark> Does he agree that it is vital that as many Members of this House as possible visit and learn, because it is only through seeing the visceral pain that was there in 2015, and is there now, that we can truly understand how much of a tinderbox Bosnia is</mark>"
3164,"<mark> It started doing so in both the 2015 and 2017 Parliaments, but the general elections cut short that work</mark>"
3165,"<mark> On the substance, we are recommending the following first, an outright ban on any Member acting as a paid parliamentary adviser, consultant or strategist, which was a recommendation of the 2018 Committee on Standards in Public Life report on Members outside interests; secondly, the introduction of a new requirement that a Member must have a written contract for any outside work that makes it explicit that their duties cannot include lobbying Ministers, Members or public officials, or providing advice about how to lobby or influence Parliament, and that their employer will give them an undertaking not to ask them to do so; and thirdly, clarification of the criteria for the serious wrong exemption in the lobbying rules, to make clearer the risks of conflicts of interest and to put an end to this being used as a loophole</mark>"
3166,"<mark>On the issue of natural justice and a fair hearing, as I have said several times recently, all Members of the House, because of article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689, are treated differently from every other citizen in the country</mark>"
3167,"<mark> I welcome the consultation, but in regard to paragraphs 196, 243 and 244 of the report, will the Chairman accept that there must be full and proper consultation before any judicial figure is appointed, and therefore before his or her report comes about Otherwise, we will have a prejudgment on the question of fairness, article 6 and all that goes with it and the issue of a fair trial with Members</mark>"
3168,"<mark> In 95% or 98% of referrals, when the Committee makes its decision, the Member accepts it and we move forward, but on the rare occasions when the Member feels badly done by, there should be, as in other organisations, a right of appeal to a completely independent organisation</mark>"
3169,"<mark> It seems illogical to me that two Members of the House, one of whom is a Minister, could be wined and dined at Wimbledon on a ticket that costs £2,500, then the Minister does not have to register that with the House and never has to register its value, even though they might be the Minister who makes decisions about tennis funding in the UK, whereas the Member who is not a Minister has to register it within 28 days</mark>"
3170,<mark>I deployed in September 1992 with 900 men and some women to save lives</mark>
3171,"<mark> We managed to save quite a number of people, for example in April 1993 we led on pulling out about 2,000 people from Srebrenica three years before the disaster of July 1995, but we failed to save many others, so, in my view, it was not a success</mark>"
3172,"<mark> It ground on until that awful genocide of Srebrenica in July 1995, when 8,372 men and boys were murdered by the Bosnian Serb armyby the way, the same Bosnian Serb army that might want to split away</mark>"
3173,"<mark> Paddy told me a story about having dinner with Franjo Tuman, the President of Croatia, in May 1995 at the Guildhall in London</mark>"
3174,"<mark> Paddy said to Tuman, How do you see the future of Bosnia in 10 years time Tuman grabbed a menu, drew a map of Bosnia and divided it in half half Serb, half Croat</mark>"
3175,"<mark> Everyone is a south Slav, but by religion they are 30% Serb, 15% Croat and over 50% Bosnian Muslim1</mark>"
3176,<mark>8 million people</mark>
3177,"<mark> Bosnia matters to us, because if the Croats and the Serbs divide the country in half, guess what will happen to 1</mark>"
3178,<mark>8 million people</mark>
3179,<mark> She called on allies to contribute personnel to the NATO headquarters in Sarajevo and to support work to counter disinformation and strengthen defence reform</mark>
3180,"<mark> I met the Elnos Group and its UK partner Emico, which recently won a contract to deliver 13 prefabricated substations for HS2 and is planning to bid for more</mark>"
3181,"<mark> In the four quarters to the end of the first quarter of 2021, total trade in goods and services was worth £117 millionan increase of 77% or £51 million on the previous year</mark>"
3182,"<mark> In a nutshell, although in courts, tribunals or professional disciplinary arrangements, any person in the land could  apply for judicial review where there had been a failure to comply with such procedures, that does not apply because of parliamentary privilege and article 9 of the Bill of Rights</mark>"
3183,"<mark> By the final meeting, only 50% of the membership had attended all three meetings, and four of the 11 members who attended that meeting had not attended the meeting in which the evidence of my right hon</mark>"
3184,<mark> Gentleman agree that under the rules paid advocacy has been banned from this House since 1695 Why do this Government appear to be bending the rules when it suits them</mark>
3185,"<mark> In 2012, the House recognised the need for a whistleblowing provision to make it clear that in exceptional cases, if there were some serious wrong, a Member could approach the responsible Minister or public official, even if to do so might incidentally benefit a paying client</mark>"
3186,"<mark>If any Member, regardless of their political affiliation, is involved in paid advocacy to the tune of £100,000 per year, I would expect the House and the Committee to come to the same conclusionfor a Member from any political party and of any affiliation</mark>"
3187,<mark> We only have an hour and a half to discuss this</mark>
3188,<mark> It turns the clock back to before 1695</mark>
3189,"<mark> The Member repeatedly, over a sustained period, lobbied officials and Ministers on behalf of his paying clients, Randox and Lynns Country Foods, from whom he was receiving more than £9,000 a month, as he still is</mark>"
3190,"<mark> In some shape or form, it has been banned since 1695 and expressly so since  cash for questions, which brought this House into terrible disrepute in the 1990s</mark>"
3191,"<mark> We would be dismantling the rule on paid advocacy, which has been around in some shape or form since 1695</mark>"
3192,<mark> It estimates that we will  need 10 GW of nuclear power by 2035</mark>
3193,"<mark> It is not in dispute that the proposed model will lower the cost of capital on nuclear projectsI fully accept thatand it is also not in dispute that it would lower overall costs, although Conservative Members take issue with the frankly heroic assumptions that underpin the claimed £30 billion to £80 billion in longterm savings visvis coalfired financed projects</mark>"
3194,"<mark> The 2015 Committee on Standards report on The Standards System in the House of Commons noted that the provisions relating to the panel had never been invoked, questioned why the investigatory panel was necessary and recommended that the provisions be reviewed</mark>"
3195,"<mark>The Leader of the House is utterly detached from the reality of most working MPs in the House, so let me inform him that most of us do not need to get paid £100,000 to do the job we are already paid for</mark>"
3196,<mark> The introduction of a House of Commons Standards Commissioner in 1995 and the Standards Committee in 2013 were key features of strengthening the system</mark>
3197,<mark> Members and the public will remember cash for questions and those Tory scandals of the 1990s</mark>
3198,"<mark> Friend the Member for Harwich and North Essex Sir Bernard Jenkin said, the 2003 recommendation of the Committee on Standards in Public Life is worth looking at</mark>"
3199,<mark> I expected maybe to come to a debate that would be the usual suspects speaking on behalf of one of their palsbut not today</mark>
3200,"<mark> Why do we not get the executive committee of the 1922 Committee to replace the whole of the judicial system across the UK If a Conservative supporter is found guilty of any offence, why do we not get a committee set up to reconsider that verdict and have a look at it once again That is the type of realm of possibility we are getting into with this</mark>"
3201,<mark> Member for North Shropshire Mr Paterson broke multiple rules when he lobbied the Government on behalf of Randox and Lynns Country Foods</mark>
3202,"<mark> If the Leader of the House wants us to look at how we approach these things in future, he should bring forward a debate, not just 90 minutes where he took up half the time, because nobody has an opportunity to get in and say anything</mark>"
3203,<mark>1212 for the purposes of Standing Order No</mark>
3204,<mark>1212 for the purposes of Standing Order No</mark>
3205,"<mark> Friend the Member for Harwich and North Essex Sir Bernard Jenkin said, the 2003 recommendation of the Committee on Standards in Public Life is worth looking at</mark>"
3206,"<mark> Does he recognise that someone who sold 1 million copies of a single in the 1990s typically saw their single reach the top 25 singles of the year, whereas about 1,700 different artists had more than 1 million streams last year He is right that there is a lot of streaming, but it is being shared so much more widely, so is it not inevitable that many people will receive less</mark>"
3207,"<mark> Some eight out of 10 artists earn less than £200 year from streaming, which is not acceptable</mark>"
3208,"<mark> One million streams sounds like an awful lot, but, in comparison to CD sales, it is not very much in terms of revenue generated for rights holders from digital service providers</mark>"
3209,<mark> The fact that the Government were able to find £2 billion for the  cultural recovery fund and bring in schemes such as the live events reinsurance scheme has kept the industry going</mark>
3210,"<mark> Streaming has increased steadily, but between 2016 and 2019figures that come from the International Property Offices survey of creative industries earningsartists remuneration has gone up by 46%, whereas revenue to the labels has only gone up by 31%</mark>"
3211,"<mark> However, in the Spanish system, about 23% of the revenue goes on administrative costs</mark>"
3212,"<mark> The Committee pointed out that CDs cost tuppencehapenny to produce, and therefore it cost virtually nothing to make millions of them, and yet they were sold for a vast amount£10 or more</mark>"
3213,"<mark> About 40% of that revenue goes into marketing and AR, which identifies artists and finds them</mark>"
3214,"<mark> However, 26% of the market for releases is now held by the small independent sector</mark>"
3215,"<mark> If a label that is signing an artist and making an initial investment of tens of millions of pounds has the knowledge that they and the artist have reached a contractual agreement that will extend and that will allow that money to be recouped over a lengthy period, that does give certainty</mark>"
3216,"<mark> For example, the NHS has given ambulance trusts an extra £55 million to boost staff numbers this winter; there is nearly half a billion to fund an enhanced discharge programme; and we have measures to reduce pressure on accident and emergency departments, reduce waiting times and improve patient flow</mark>"
3217,"<mark> One of our main defences is, of course, our vaccination programmes, and we are expanding our booster programme, which hit the milestone of 19 million doses yesterday, along with delivering the largest flu vaccination programme in UK history</mark>"
3218,"<mark> Yesterday, we announced how we will be buying a total of 114 million additional Pfizer and Moderna doses for 2022 and 2023, which will futureproof our Great British vaccination effort and make sure we can protect even more people in the years ahead</mark>"
3219,"<mark> Today, I am pleased to update the House on the £700 million fund that we announced in September for elective recovery</mark>"
3220,"<mark> This includes £112 million for the northeast and Yorkshire, £131 million for the midlands and  £97 million for the northwest</mark>"
3221,<mark> At least £330 million will be invested in the NHS estate and a further £250 million will be spent on digital initiatives that aid elective recovery</mark>
3222,"<mark> Over £600 million from this fund has already been committed to approved bids, such as for new wards at University Hospitals Birmingham, a new South Mersey elective hub and a new, modular unit in Castle Hill Hospital in Hull</mark>"
3223,<mark> It is part of £5</mark>
3224,"<mark>4 billion that we have announced to support the NHS response to the pandemic in the second half of the year and it builds on the work done ahead of last winter, where we invested £450 million to upgrade AE facilities in over 120 separate trusts, to boost capacity</mark>"
3225,"<mark> It was volume 2 of their famous vinyl album, if I recall correctly</mark>"
3226,"<mark> Friend the Member for East Yorkshire supported in the mid2000s, and that is why it is 70 years rather than 50 years</mark>"
3227,"<mark> On iTunes, it is 0</mark>"
3228,"<mark> Apple Music is a little more generous, with 0</mark>"
3229,<mark> They have said that 82% of professional musicians have made £200 per year less from streaming</mark>
3230,"<mark> This is totally different from the 1990s, when someone who did sell massive amounts of singles got real rewards</mark>"
3231,"<mark> We are coming into the Christmas season, and someone who is lucky enough to have had a Christmas hit in the 1970s or 1980sthere have not been so many recentlywill hit the jackpot, because their song will get played again and again and go right to the top of the steaming charts</mark>"
3232,"<mark>I was waiting patiently for my colleague, the third member of MP4, to get to his feet today</mark>"
3233,<mark> Gentleman that he is the best drummer in MP4</mark>
3234,"<mark> It is important that we pay tribute to his talent, as seen in his solo work and in MP4, of which there are several members here today and which has brought much entertainment both inside and outside the House</mark>"
3235,"<mark> The 1960s gave us some of the greatest bands, but they also gave us the sharp managers who invented new ways to rip off talented and often workingclass youngsters</mark>"
3236,"<mark> It is the Houses duty to modernise the law to reflect the reality of the music industry and challenge the status quo whereby most streaming incomean estimated 55% of itends up in the pockets of record labels, streaming platforms and digital giants while 15% goes to artists and publishers</mark>"
3237,"<mark> When an original music workor lyrics accompanying musicis  created, the composer or composers of that work have rights under the 1988 Act to control exploitation of that work</mark>"
3238,"<mark> However, it is suggested that about eight out of 10 performers earn less than £200 a year from music streaming</mark>"
3239,"<mark> However, while performers are entitled to equitable remuneration for performances for radio, television and other channels, they are not in respect of music streaming due to the exceptions set out in the 1988 Act</mark>"
3240,<mark> The UK music industry contributed £5</mark>
3241,"<mark>8 billion to the UK economy in 2019, which was an 11% increase on the prior year</mark>"
3242,"<mark> Employment in the industry hit an alltime high in 2019, at 197,000 people, which was an increase of 3% on the prior year</mark>"
3243,<mark> The total export revenue of the music industry was £2</mark>
3244,"<mark>9 billion in 2019, which was an increase of about 9% on the prior year</mark>"
3245,"<mark> Gentleman will have read the IPOs report, so he will have seen the chart showing that at the end of 2015, about 16,000 artists made up 90% of Spotifys streams</mark>"
3246,"<mark> By the second quarter of last year, that number had gone up to 43,000, so the market is much more fragmented</mark>"
3247,"<mark> Gentleman makes a great deal of how little an artist receives for 1 million streams, but in fact, 1 billion streams is not that much</mark>"
3248,"<mark> To give an example, Mabel, one of our most successful upandcoming artists achieved more than 4 billion streams</mark>"
3249,"<mark> The income from 1 million streams is equivalent to the income from 1,000 CD sales</mark>"
3250,"<mark> When I asked, Could you fill a venue here in London he said, I could halffill one in London, but I could fill 10 venues in Los Angeles</mark>"
3251,"<mark> If we look at the data, we see that, at 31%, live performance is the main revenue stream</mark>"
3252,"<mark> Then there is teaching of music at 9%, audio streaming royalties at 6%, physical sales at 5%, digital sales at 5%, sessional orchestral work at 5%, broadcasts at 5%, public performances at 4%, commissions for stage at 3%, merchandise at 3%, video streaming royalties at 3%, and a whole raft of others</mark>"
3253,"<mark> At the start, the streaming service takes its cut, which is typically around 30%, although there is no industry standard, and the rest is split among all the other parties back down the supply chain</mark>"
3254,<mark> Today is also the anniversary of the release in 1984 of Band Aids Do they know its Christmas</mark>
3255,"<mark> I am old enough to recall Tim, now Lord, ClementJoness Live Music Bill in another place, testing parliamentary support on more than one occasion before the then Government were evidentially satisfied that they could support a version of the Bill becoming the landmark Live Music Act 2012</mark>"
3256,<mark> In 201819precovidthe UK music industry contributed £5</mark>
3257,"<mark>8 billion to the UK economy, up 11% from 2018</mark>"
3258,"<mark> In 2019, prepandemic this is quite interestingthe median reported income for musicians currently signed to major record companies was £51,000, for musicians signed to independent record labels it was £20,000, and for selfreleasing artists it was £13,000</mark>"
3259,"<mark> Sadly, the Music creators earnings in the digital era report found no evidence that there was ever a time when recorded music was the basis of substantial income for most musicians, even in the 1990s when revenues in the music industry were higher</mark>"
3260,"<mark> On behalf of the campaigners and the many other voices across the country, and given the support for the Bill on both sides of the House, I ask the Government to allow it to be considered in more detail at a future date</mark>"
3261,"<mark> My parents and grandparents were lucky enough to witness the British invasion when, in the mid1960s, rock and pop acts of the United Kingdom penetrated the shores of the United States and flooded the music industry</mark>"
3262,"<mark> Screened on Disney Plus, the eighthour documentary covers the making of the Beatles 1970 album Let It Be</mark>"
3263,"<mark> It is unbelievable that sitting alone in a studio, playing a great selection of songssometimes, depending how they were scheduledand broadcasting to thousands, or hundreds, depending on the size of the radio station, is a job people get paid for</mark>"
3264,"<mark> I love their workPhil Collins is a genius, from his work with Genesis to his great solo albums of the 1980s and 1990s</mark>"
3265,<mark> The days of hopping on the bus into town to spend our pocket money on the latest 7inch single are long gone</mark>
3266,"<mark> There is a temptation to think that every music label is some big corporate beast with millions of pounds sloshing around, but that is simply not the case</mark>"
3267,"<mark> Well, that came all the way to New Zealand, and it was great to be able to sing the likes of U2 as a 15yearold</mark>"
3268,"<mark> I think Members across the House will be staggered to know that the chairman and chief executive officer of one of the three major corporations that dominate the market of recorded music is set to receive more income this year£153 million, according to industry press reportsthan every songwriter and composer in the UK combined, including the rich ones, will receive from the streaming of their music in this country</mark>"
3269,"<mark> The report, titled Economics of music streaming, was unanimously agreed, crossparty, after many months of hearings with witnesses from all parts of the music industry and after hundreds of written submissions on the subject were received</mark>"
3270,"<mark> Sadly, the other big two, Warner and Universal, have not followed suit, and in the latter case, a public share offering has been issued that will result in the extraordinary £153 million payout to the companys boss, at a time when many artists have been struggling to pay their rent, as we heard in evidence</mark>"
3271,"<mark> It extends the existing Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 to modernise the law for the new world of music streaming</mark>"
3272,"<mark> The Committee concluded that the fix that I am proposing today was the best way to build on existing UK law to rectify the matter, but there is an issue with how much streaming services pay and with how much they are paid by record companies about 30%, after the Chancellor has his bit, of the cut from the subscription we pay and the ad revenues</mark>"
3273,"<mark> The point is that labels no longer have to manufacture or distribute records, there is no longer a percentage getting broken on the way to the record shopall those costs are gone</mark>"
3274,<mark> Streaming revenue actually grew by 20% in 2020</mark>
3275,"<mark> In fact, fully independent music accounts  for a very small proportion, probably 6%, of the total market, and fully independent artists who experience success are the ones making the most from streaming</mark>"
3276,"<mark> As for companies, which are sometimes making 20% profit margins in the streaming era, with none of the costs associated with distribution or manufacturing, saying that they will pass any cut to that margin on to their own artists, that is surely the strongest possible argument that there is something very wrong with competition in this market</mark>"
3277,<mark> One company may control as much as 40% of the market</mark>
3278,"<mark> When changes were made in 2003 to copyright in relation to film, similar points were made, but we have seen the burgeoning expansion of the British film industry since that point, and I want the same for music</mark>"
3279,"<mark> Gentleman mentions Lucian Grainge; he may be aware that were an artist in Britain to produce a song and get 1 million streams, they would receive around £100, so to receive the £153 million that Lucian Grainge gets, that artist would need 1</mark>"
3280,<mark>5 million million streams</mark>
3281,"<mark> While Lucian Grainge may be a great corporate man, making £3 million a week, he has never produced any music that we would ever want to listen to</mark>"
3282,<mark> It has brought in a programme called Artists Forward in which it has essentially written off unrecouped balances for artists signed before the year 2000</mark>
3283,"<mark> Will he acknowledge that it is also a vital part of our tourism attraction, bringing in about £4</mark>"
3284,<mark>7 billion in tourism revenue for this country every year</mark>
3285,<mark> We are talking about £4</mark>
3286,"<mark>7 billion of spending in the UK economy, which was an increase of 6% of the prior year</mark>"
3287,"<mark> I recall that in the early 2000s there were sites such as Napster, which in their very early  stages shared content that I am sure the artist did not even know was being shared</mark>"
3288,"<mark> We have to get the right balance between protecting artists 100%, ensuring innovation with regard to platforms and new forms of engaging with media and music, and making sure that we remain competitive in the UK</mark>"
3289,"<mark> Watford has the Colosseum, which has done recordings for films such as The Lord of the Ringsreally incredible pieces that have been heard around the world by millions, if not billions, of people</mark>"
3290,<mark> Does he agree that it is a scandal that artists are getting perhaps a quarter of what the big record labels are getting from streaming services As my hon</mark>
3291,"<mark> I very much hope I will receive an invitation to hear his crossparty band, MP4</mark>"
3292,<mark> Global revenues hit £16</mark>
3293,<mark>2 billion last yearthe highest since 2002</mark>
3294,"<mark> Between 2015 and 2019, revenues enjoyed by labels have grown by more than £200 million</mark>"
3295,"<mark> 1 pop stars on Radio 1 or at the forefront of everyones mind when we think about rock and roll or music streaming, but there is a huge weight of people who are fansindividuals or groups who are more at the edges</mark>"
3296,"<mark> It is now commonplace, but it was a brave and innovative vision and move from Daniel Ek, Spotifys founder, back in 2006</mark>"
3297,"<mark> There were 100 million new music subscribers in 2020, taking the total to 467 million, whereas back in 2015 it stood at 76</mark>"
3298,<mark>8 million</mark>
3299,"<mark> Each one of those subscribers is paying on average £120 a year, so we can see the growth and the enormity of streaming</mark>"
3300,"<mark> A licence gives the artist 50% of the royalties for a song, whereas a sale gives them between 18% and 30%</mark>"
3301,"<mark> We might have needed to provide some extra money through universal credit, and that would be right, but these  international companies should have paid their way and not asked the British taxpayer to pay those wages on their behalf</mark>"
3302,<mark> I note that in 2017 the figure was 31</mark>
3303,"<mark>92%, and I am sure my hon</mark>"
3304,"<mark> Friend will be surprised to learn that it went down in 2018, 2019 and 2020, to 30</mark>"
3305,<mark>13%</mark>
3306,<mark> to 100% of the money they generate</mark>
3307,"<mark> Artist remuneration has risen to 46% of overall revenue, compared with an increase in label revenues of 31%, meaning that artists are claiming a larger share of streaming revenue than they have done traditionally</mark>"
3308,"<mark> Successful artists from the 1980s funded investment into new artists in the 1990s, which in turn funded investment into the young artists of the 2000s</mark>"
3309,"<mark> I suggest to her that if we look at the music business around the world, 30% RD is what is happening in all markets</mark>"
3310,"<mark> YouTube accounted for more than 20% of streaming consumption in the UK last year, but generated only £35 million in royalties, £20 million less than artists and labels earned from good oldfashioned vinyl records</mark>"
3311,"<mark> In fact, the top 1% will get richer at everybody elses expense</mark>"
3312,"<mark> Gentleman in a moment, because no doubt he will want to remind us how reasonable it is that the CEO of Universal gets £153 million a year, which is more than the entirety of sales and of streaming for all UK artists and songwriters, including people such as Ed Sheeran</mark>"
3313,"<mark> To get that from streaming, as I mentioned, he would have to have 1</mark>"
3314,<mark>5 million million streams</mark>
3315,"<mark> Gentleman may claim that 1 million streams is not very much, but I would very much enjoy a small fraction of that for this speech anywhere it was shown</mark>"
3316,<mark> It is a lot for a musician to break through that million mark</mark>
3317,"<mark> I appreciate that, in the global marketplace, there are stars who break through into the billions, but that is not the point</mark>"
3318,<mark> The point has been made already about the hundreds of thousands of people in the industry and its importance for the export and tourism markets</mark>
3319,<mark> 1 in the charts</mark>
3320,"<mark> We have set out the creative industries sector deal, the creative sector tax reliefs, the film and television production restart scheme and the culture recovery fund, and the Chancellors plan for growth sets out a major longterm commitment to the sector, which we calculate contributes approximately £116 billion to the UK economy</mark>"
3321,"<mark> At the recent Budget the Government announced £42 million to support our creative industries, and we include in that the small and mediumsized enterprises at the heart of film, music and video gamesthat broader nexus of digital entrepreneurship</mark>"
3322,"<mark> The BPI reported revenues from streaming growing to almost £737 million in 2020, which is a 15% increase during the pandemic, with smartphones, smart speakers and music streaming services providing unprecedented choice for consumers</mark>"
3323,"<mark> That was the biggest arts funding package in our history, and the Chancellor made available £2 billion at speed, with awards to more than 800 musicbased organisations</mark>"
3324,"<mark> We also put in place the £800 million reinsurance scheme and I am delighted, as I am sure all Members are, that we can get back to live music venues, and indeed to live theatre and pub theatre</mark>"
3325,"<mark> Our 1709 Statute of Anne was the first copyright Act in the world, and today the UK is a world leader in copyright law and intellectual property enforcement</mark>"
3326,"<mark> We are determined to tackle the problem of piracy, and not just those of us  who remember recording Top of the Pops on a cassette in the 1970s, which is a low form of thatI would not say it is harmless, but as the former Chair of the Select Committee made clear, probably all of us old enough to do so did it, and it was wrong</mark>"
3327,"<mark> From the early 2000s, record companies saw a 15year period of global revenue decline</mark>"
3328,"<mark> Recorded music revenues were decimated due to digital piracy, and subscription streaming services such as Spotifyothers are availableentered the market in 2008</mark>"
3329,"<mark> By 2015, they had played a major part in halting that decline, as consumers began to adopt subscription services and paying for the right to listen to music</mark>"
3330,"<mark> In 2015, there were on average 2</mark>"
3331,<mark>1 billion streams a month</mark>
3332,"<mark> By 2020, that figure had grown to 10 billion</mark>"
3333,"<mark> I am pleased that a number of singersongwriters, composers and musicians in my area have benefited from that, including MaryAnne Hatton, Oliver Seager and Jack PerryCockings, who have all received support of up to £10,000 from the fund</mark>"
3334,"<mark> Decca Records contributed £10,000 to kickstart our Dame Vera Lynn memorial project and the statue dedicated to her, but it must not be the case that the record companies and those advocating a voluntary approach can just do or give what they want</mark>"
3335,"<mark> Friend the Member for Watford Dean Russell regaled us with earlier, I may even have auditioned for the New Zealand version of the Spice Girls in 1998, and I was also in a queue at 3 am, in the ExCeL centre in London, to audition for The X Factor in 2010</mark>"
3336,"<mark> If we need a new generation of MP4, many of us would quite like to step forward and do that</mark>"
3337,<mark> 11 2</mark>
3338,<mark> Friend the Member for Perth and North Perthshire Pete Wishart and I are occasionally together in a musical enterprise called MP4</mark>
3339,"<mark> It makes up more than 70% of UK recorded music revenues, generating hundreds of millions of pounds of new revenue for the UK music industry</mark>"
3340,"<mark> The music industrys importance to the UK economy is frequently citedas the Select Committee points out, it contributes more than £5 billion in gross value addedand we are the second biggest exporter of music in the world, which does an enormous amount in terms of global Britain and the projection of our soft power</mark>"
3341,<mark> Lucian Grainge is the chief executive of Universal Music and is going to bank a huge amount of money this year because Universal Music has just conducted a very successful initial public offering and sold a 10% share</mark>
3342,"<mark> Beginning in the early 2000s, there was a 15year decline in music industry revenue that was directly attributable to piracy</mark>"
3343,"<mark> We have been together in so many of the various torturous debates about copyright reform, and I think we all still bear the scars of the Digital Economy Act 2017</mark>"
3344,<mark> I just hope that the record labels that have written to us so assiduously in the past few weeks sometimes remember what we did for them when the dark times started to descend on the sector and the industry in the early 2000s</mark>
3345,"<mark> Gentlemans for about  20 years in MP4, the worlds only parliamentary rock band</mark>"
3346,"<mark> Lots of people ask, What does this musical moonlighting mean for the future of MP4 Well, we are the only rock band in the world that can sustain political differences as well as musical differences, so I think we can maybe just put up with a bit of musical moonlighting</mark>"
3347,"<mark> I was signed to two major record companies I signed to Chrysalis Records in 1987, and it was taken over by EMI in the early 1990s</mark>"
3348,<mark> We did quite well during that period we sold 1</mark>
3349,"<mark>5 million records, we had modest success in the UK with two topfive albums, and we had a couple of topfive albums in Scandinavia and Germany</mark>"
3350,<mark> We sold 1</mark>
3351,"<mark> Thousands did return, but with lifechanging injuries, and over 3,500 personnel from other NATO forces were also killed</mark>"
3352,"<mark> Since Ahmad Shah Durrani founded modernday Afghanistan in the 1700s, it has not been run from the centre</mark>"
3353,"<mark> The objective of hunting down and destroying alQaeda after 911 was widely supported, and it triggered NATOs article 5 for the first time</mark>"
3354,"<mark> The last king, Zahir, was overthrown in 1973, and that triggered a power struggle between two diametrically opposed movements the Communist party and the Islamist movementthe mujaheddin</mark>"
3355,<mark> It mobilised tens of thousands of holy warriors who were willing to die for their cause</mark>
3356,"<mark> However, there was the colossal blanket of NATO security, and a huge development budget often described as an international aid juggernaut; US spending alone peaked in one year at $110 billion</mark>"
3357,"<mark> Secondly, we denied the Taliban a seat at the table in December  2001 at the Bonn talks</mark>"
3358,"<mark> Thirdly, we made no real effort to start training an Afghan indigenous security force until 2006</mark>"
3359,"<mark> Negotiations began in earnest in 2018, but when a deal was finally signed in February 2020, the agreement was between the United States and the Taliban; this time, the Afghan Government were not at the table</mark>"
3360,<mark> The 1</mark>
3361,<mark>4% cut in defence spending over the next four years is deeply worrying</mark>
3362,"<mark> One thing I would like to see from the inquiry is an investigation into what assessment, prior or immediately prior to the intervention in 2001, was made of the militarys capability to intervene and maintain our defences at the level required</mark>"
3363,"<mark> In 2009, the NATO conference took place in Edinburgh</mark>"
3364,"<mark> What I will never forget is that while they were enjoying a drop of Scotlands finest, they suddenly said to me, What on earth are you doing in Afghanistan This was in 2009, eight years after we went in</mark>"
3365,"<mark> Those attacks killed 2,977 innocent civilians, including 67 British citizens, and we were right to defend our national security</mark>"
3366,"<mark> We know that the Taliban are the root cause of the death and destruction that, unfortunately, has come to define Afghanistan since the 1990s, but we need to understand why they were able to defeat the Afghan army at such a shattering scale and pace</mark>"
3367,<mark> 1107</mark>
3368,"<mark> Why have so many colleagues failed to get adequate responses from the Foreign Office and Home Office helplines on behalf of their constituents How many more vulnerable Afghans do the Government have on their list of people who need to be supported to leave the country Why is the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme still not open for applications Is it because the Government actually have no intention of ever opening it for applications Are they in effect pursuing an operation of tapping on the shoulder, rather than opening the scheme up for applications, because the response would be so overwhelming If so, the Minister should inform the House</mark>"
3369,"<mark> Just to be clear, what I said in my remarks was that there had already been multiple inquiries into the Afghan intervention preceding 2010some by the Defence Committee</mark>"
3370,"<mark> It has been handed over to the Taliban, but the spirit of what is now there in Afghanistan will be bigger than anything the Taliban can do to undo it and turn it back to what we saw in the 1990s</mark>"
3371,<mark> It is my pleasure to respond on behalf of the Government</mark>
3372,"<mark> As a result of our efforts and those of our allies, secondary school enrolment rose from 13% of children to almost 60%</mark>"
3373,"<mark> Over 8 million more children, including 3</mark>"
3374,"<mark>6 million girls, were attending school than in 2001</mark>"
3375,"<mark>  Basic health services reached 85% of the population, and the proportion of people with access to clean water and sanitation doubled</mark>"
3376,"<mark> The 11 September attacks were the only occasion in NATOs history on which it has invoked article 5, its collective selfdefence clause</mark>"
3377,"<mark> They are, first, to preserve the counterterrorism gains that we have achieved, and ensure that Afghanistan does not again become a source of threats to the region or beyond, including here in the UK; secondly, to provide humanitarian support for the Afghan people, who are facing extreme hardship42% of the population, more than 18 million people, are suffering crisis or emergency levels of severe acute malnutrition; thirdly, to press for inclusive politics and respect for human rights, especially the full and equal rights of girls to go to school and women to go to work; and finally, to ensure that the events in Afghanistan do not destabilise the region, for example, through uncontrolled outflows of refugees or the export of narcotics</mark>"
3378,"<mark> The Prime Minister has said that we will double humanitarian and development assistance for Afghanistan this year, to £286 million</mark>"
3379,"<mark> On 31 October, he announced the allocation of £50 million of that to fund emergency humanitarian support</mark>"
3380,<mark> The money will help to provide 2</mark>
3381,"<mark>5 million people with lifesaving healthcare, food security, and shelter</mark>"
3382,"<mark> Our main focus right now is on ensuring safe passage for anyone remaining in Afghanistan who needs to leave, supporting the thousands of new arrivals in the UK, and continuing to provide assistance for the Afghan people who remain in Afghanistanbut, of course, we are always learning lessons learning lessons from Afghanistan has been a continuous process</mark>"
3383,"<mark> That is why, after the conclusion of Operation Herrick in 2014, the Army conducted a thorough internal review</mark>"
3384,<mark> We  have actually reduced greenhouse gas by a quarter since we came to power</mark>
3385,"<mark> We are the first country in the world, as he well knows, to legislate for net zero by 2050</mark>"
3386,"<mark> In the Budget, we announced another £620 million for that transition to zeroemission vehicles and £180 million for sustainable aviation fuel</mark>"

3738,<mark> Members that this debate has to finish at 4</mark>
3739,"<mark> I certainly hope that the Government will consider new clause 4 carefully, but I want to focus on new clause 9 and the impact that the change in notification of revocation of nationality has had</mark>"
3740,<mark> Clause 9 is not</mark>
3741,"<mark> I will reduce the time limit to just three minutes, because I want to try to get as many people in as I possibly can, and I will ask the Minister to respond to the debate no later than 4</mark>"
3742,"<mark>On new clause 4, is it not the case for this very explicit group of people, who have given loyalty and service to this country in standing for freedom, liberty and the  rule of law, that it would be deeply ironic and unjust if we were to leave them to the vagaries of a regime that has turned out to be entirely opposite freedom, liberty and the rule of law That is why we owe them this duty of care, if they choose to take it up</mark>"
3743,"<mark> Member for Haltemprice and Howden Mr Davis, which would remove clause 9</mark>"
3744,"<mark> The point about clause 9, which the right hon</mark>"
3745,<mark> It is perfectly legitimate for Government Back Benchers to point out that the genesis of removal is to be found in the 2002 ActInterruption</mark>
3746,<mark> My answer is that the British Nationality Act 1981 gives too much power to the Home SecretaryInterruption</mark>
3747,<mark> Taylor said that Palmerstons 1850 Civis Romanus sum speech on the Don Pacifico affair was the greatest speech in Parliament</mark>
3748,"<mark>I wish to speak to new clause 5, and I thank the more than 50 colleagues, representing every party in this House, who have supported it</mark>"
3749,"<mark> Why is this needed I would illustrate that with one casethat of 20yearold Tony Chung, who has been handed a prison sentence of more than three and a half years</mark>"
3750,"<mark>I rise to speak to new clause 4, which would secure the right of abode of the brave and loyal servicemen who served Queen and country in the British military, in the Hong Kong Military Service Corps and the Hong Kong royal naval service corps, until 1997</mark>"
3751,"<mark> That is a very low number of people when compared with the 3 million citizens affected by the changes made last year to introduce the BNO passport, which was such a welcome support for the people of Hong Kong</mark>"
3752,<mark>999% of cases</mark>
3753,"<mark> There are millions of people who potentially might be affected, and that is why reassurance is required to make clear that this is purely about a very simple business of notification when a person is unreachable or in a war zone</mark>"
3754,"<mark> Between 2006 and 2018, 175 people lost their citizenship on national security grounds, but 104 of those instances occurred in just one year, 2017</mark>"

3760,<mark>1 The British Nationality Act 1981 is amended as follows</mark>
3761,<mark>The Chagos islanders have suffered over half a century of consistent injustices</mark>
3762,"<mark> They were forcibly exiled from their homeland, the Chagos islandsDiego Garcia and outer islands such as Peros Banhosby the Harold Wilson Administration in the late 1960s to make way for a military base, and they were typically relocated against their will in Mauritius, but also in the Seychelles and other locations</mark>"
3763,<mark> It is the sort of thing you would expect to read in the history books of colonialism of several hundred years ago</mark>
3764,<mark> We have heard a lot about over 3 million BNOBritish national overseascitizens in Hong Kong with a potential right to settle in this country as a result of the increasing Chinese erosion of democracy there</mark>
3765,"<mark> With the Chagos Islanders, only numbers in the hundreds to low thousands would be eligible</mark>"
3766,"<mark> Gentleman could cast his mind back to the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, where, for the first time, people who had acquired British citizenship through birth were made subject to citizenship deprivation powers</mark>"
3767,"<mark> Clause 9 is about peoples citizenship, identity and, ultimately, rights; without citizenship, people do not have rights, and that leaves them without an identity or a sense of belonging</mark>"
3768,<mark> The Home Office confirms that the cost of registration is only £372</mark>
3769,"<mark> The remaining £640 is, therefore, money made after delivery of the service</mark>"
3770,"<mark> I strongly urge Members from all parts of the House to carefully consider new clause 8, tabled by my hon</mark>"
3771,"<mark> New clause 5, in the name of the right hon</mark>"
3772,"<mark> That is particularly true for younger Hongkongers who have fled the country over fear of repercussions, as those born after 1997 do not hold BNO passports, and are therefore unable to settle in the UK via the BNO route</mark>"
3773,"<mark> Those documents were issued to citizens following the handover of Hong Kong from the UK to China in  1997, so those aged under 24 cannot benefit from the BNO scheme</mark>"
3774,"<mark> Again, the Opposition proposed that in Committee, and naturally we fully support new clause 5</mark>"
3775,"<mark> By accepting new clause 5, they could take a significant and immediate step towards that, with the Oppositions support</mark>"
3776,"<mark> We already have a couple of hundred of people in the asylum system, and if Ministers could find, or if we could find, another route, that would take a bit of pressure off the asylum system</mark>"
3777,"<mark>I want first to acknowledge my support for new clause 8, which my hon</mark>"
3778,<mark> It seeks the removal of clause 9tabled by the Home Secretarywhich would deprive UK nationals of citizenship without notice</mark>
3779,<mark> Little Amal is the 3</mark>
3780,"<mark>5metre puppet which has travelled 8,000 km across the world to raise the plight of refugees and support them</mark>"
3781,"<mark> I want to speak about clause 9, which has been mentioned several times during the debate</mark>"
3782,<mark> We are raising genuine concerns on behalf of our constituents and their families</mark>
3783,<mark>I wish to focus on clause 9 but will refer to amendment 12</mark>
3784,"<mark> The power to deprive an individual of their citizenship has been available for more than a century, since the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914, and is currently also contained in the 1981 Act</mark>"
3785,<mark> Home Office powers to strip British nationals of their citizenship were introduced after the 2005 London bombings and broadened in 2014</mark>
3786,"<mark>I was proud to add my name to new clause 8, tabled by my hon</mark>"
3787,<mark> It amounts to a fundamental rejection of our international obligations under the 1951 UN convention relating to the status of refugees and does nothing to resolve these complex issues at all</mark>
3788,"<mark> The racialised nature of this tiered system is obvious the citizenship of those like myself, many of my constituents and millions of others of minority and migrant heritage is less secure and less important than those who belong to majority ethnic groups in the United Kingdom</mark>"
3789,"<mark> I absolutely support new clause 2, tabled by the hon</mark>"
3790,"<mark> We did wrong to the Chagos islanders in the 1970s and 80s when they were driven off their land, and we have done wrong by them many times since then</mark>"
3791,"<mark> Government amendments 17 and 18, in relation to deprivation of citizenship, are minor and technical amendments to correct a drafting error in clause 9, so this is an appropriate opportunity to address amendment 12 tabled by my right hon</mark>"
3792,"<mark> It amends section 40 of the British Nationality Act 1981 to allow the requirement to give notice of a decision to deprive a person of their citizenship to be disapplied in certain limited circumstances, such as where there is no way of communicating with the person</mark>"
3793,<mark> The Governments minor amendments to clause 9 clarify that the statutory right of appeal in deprivation cases is a right to appeal against the deprivation decision itself and not the deprivation order</mark>
3794,<mark> The 1981 Act provides a statutory right of appeal against a decision to deprive</mark>
3795,<mark> Clause 9 preserves that right of appeal in cases where the notice of a decision to deprive has not been served</mark>
3796,"<mark>Amendment 12 would remove clause 9 in its entirety, undermining the integrity of the immigration system and this Governments efforts to keep dangerous people out of this country</mark>"
3797,"<mark> We will continue to consider what more we could do, particularly given the low uptake of the £40 million Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office fund designed to assist this diaspora community, and we will certainly be keen to look at that and, potentially, at how it could allow those people to settle here in the UK</mark>"
3798,"<mark> He mentions traineeships, which are fantastic initiatives with a 75% success rate in helping young people and a great example of our plan for jobs in action, spreading opportunity right across the country</mark>"
3799,"<mark> It has conducted webinars for well over 1,000 haulage businesses and it sends monthly emails to more than 14,000 hauliers on the next steps</mark>"
3800,"<mark> There are currently 1,000 places available each year, and the scheme is substantially undersubscribed</mark>"
3801,"<mark> I should also point out that new clause 7 itself would see the applicant, if they left  NHS employment within three years, having to pay the fee</mark>"
3802,"<mark> Within the sample, 90% of Indian and Sri Lankan parents had chosen to contact the high commission to obtain letters to show their child was in fact not a citizen, and so clearly had no problem in approaching their authorities</mark>"
3803,"<mark> In many cases, the parents had, I think it is safe to say, a chequered immigration record, with only 16% of parents having permission to be in the UK at the time of the childs birth</mark>"
3804,"<mark> In 67% of the cases, the parents had obtained leave to remain in the UK as a result of the childs applications</mark>"
3805,"<mark>1 The Secretary of State must, within six months of the date of Royal Assent to this Act, make regulations exempting relevant persons from the payment of fees in respect of the exercise of functions in connection with immigration or nationality under section 68 of the Immigration Act 2014</mark>"
3806,"<mark>Amendments made 28, page 21, line 29, leave out 2 and insert 1A</mark>"
3807,"<mark> Section 8 requires decisionmakers to take into account, as damaging a claimants credibility, certain types of behaviours, such as behaviour designed to mislead or not acting in good faith</mark>"
3808,"<mark> We support new clauses 4 and 5 on Hong Kong citizens, new clause 7 on health care workersit seems a bit of a cheek to be charging people for the privilege of putting themselves at risk fighting the pandemicand those amendments and new clauses from the Joint Committee on Human Rights</mark>"
3809,"<mark> My new clause 4 would secure those objectives and finally give these servants of the Crown the right to be treated as fully British, which is no less than they deserve</mark>"
3810,"<mark> Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden Mr Davis, which would remove clause 9, is a quite straightforward legal matter</mark>"
3811,"<mark> Member for Enfield, Southgate Bambos Charalambous, the Labour Government, through the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002as well as through further legislation in 2016codified and ensured that a Home Secretary of whatever political party had the power to exclude or take away somebodys citizenship in certain circumstances</mark>"
3812,"<mark> If the Labour party opposes in principle what the previous Labour Government did in 2002 and 2016, I am certain that its FrontBench team would have tabled an amendment</mark>"
3813,"<mark> There is a requirement for exceptional circumstances in clause 9, which are there to protect them, and no one has anything to fear from the clause at all</mark>"
3814,"<mark>I wish to support new clause 8, tabled by my hon</mark>"
3815,"<mark> The fee of £1,330 is almost four times the cost to the Home Office of processing an application</mark>"
3816,<mark> Sometimes people lose their jobs because they do not have leave to remain between one twoandahalfyear period ending and the Home Office getting round to granting the next</mark>
3817,"<mark> Lockdown happened in one of the gaps between twoandahalfyear periods, and the fathers employer did not know whether it was allowed to furlough him under the new scheme, so it did not</mark>"
3818,"<mark> I very much agree with him, but unfortunately they do not, and every two and a half years they have extortionate visa fees</mark>"
3819,"<mark> How do people cope with massive fees For one family I know, we are talking about £14,000 every two and a half years in order to stay in the UK</mark>"
3820,"<mark> According to analysis by the New Statesman, nearly  6 million people in England and Wales could be affected, and under this proposal, two in five people from an ethnic minority background are eligible to be deprived of their citizenship without being told</mark>"
3821,"<mark> How can we trust the Government and the Home Office How can we trust them with the measures proposed in clause 9 Simply put, we cannot, and I therefore commend the right hon</mark>"
3822,"<mark> Member for Haltemprice and Howden Mr Davis on bringing forward amendment 12, which would remove clause 9 from the Bill</mark>"
3823,"<mark> We support that new clause, which concerns the fee£1,012 for a childthat people must pay to exercise their right to be registered as a British citizen</mark>"
3824,"<mark> Members across this House, I have raised many cases on behalf of constituents navigating this inefficient,  ineffective and expensive system</mark>"
3825,"<mark>Even though the Scottish National party has fundamental disagreements with most of this horrific Bill, that is not the case for part 1, where we are in agreement with much of it</mark>"
3826,"<mark> Members might be interested to know that, in 2018, the Home Office made profits of £500 million by charging £500 million more than it cost to process applications</mark>"
3827,"<mark> The cost to the Home Office of the registration process is about £372 a person, but to the person applying, it is a minimum of £1,100 for children and £1,200 for an adult</mark>"
3828,"<mark> I would like nobody to experience it, but I would urge Conservative Members to trust me when I say that it took him years to save up the £1,200, and he could not have saved any harder</mark>"
3829,<mark> Amendment 2 in the name of the right hon</mark>
3830,"<mark> We are very much opposed to clause 9, which, as we have heard, grants the Home Secretary the power to strip UK nationals of their citizenship in secret and without advance warning</mark>"
3831,<mark> Does he share my concern that 93% of those who have been arrested just for being prodemocracy are young people We have a unique obligation to protect them and provide them with safe and legal passage</mark>
3832,"<mark> The key point that arises from her remarks is that the British Government have, sensibly and rightly, introduced the British National Overseas visa, which allows people in Hong Kong who registered for that scheme before the handover of Hong Kong in 1997 the right to settle in this country</mark>"
3833,"<mark>I wish to speak to new clause 8 about child citizenship fees, which I am grateful has been signed by a number of Members</mark>"
3834,"<mark> If the £35 fee introduced back in 1983 had risen in line with inflation, it would be only £120 today</mark>"
3835,"<mark> Instead, we charge £1,012a fee that has doubled in the past decade, and which the Government have the ability to increase at will</mark>"
3836,"<mark> I hope that, when new clause 8hopefullygoes to a vote, every other Member of this House will walk through the Lobby with me and show those young people that they have every single right to be here, that we will not continue to price them out, and that they should be able to access every single right, just like myself and the Prime Minister have been able to do</mark>"
3837,"<mark> Member agree that, while the amendment is welcome and it would be an improvement on the current situation, it would still mean that young people born after 1997 were relying on the BNO status of their parents, and that that would disproportionately impact poorer Hongkongers and people whose families moved after 1997</mark>"
3838,"<mark> It is likely that if this Bill had been law in the early 1970s, I would have been stripped of my citizenship as a young child</mark>"
3839,"<mark> Household energy bills have increased by more than £230 since last winter and are set to increase even more early next year, and we have recently seen higher tax receipts from energy bills</mark>"
3840,<mark> I therefore call on Members from across the House to support new clause 2</mark>
3841,<mark> Member for Crawley Henry Smith in proposing new clause 2</mark>
3842,"<mark> I wish to put on record the Oppositions support for the new clause, which seeks to rectify the longstanding injustice in British nationality law that affects a relatively small number of peopleChagossian people, descendants of the Chagos islanders, who were forcibly removed from the British Indian Ocean Territory in the 1960s</mark>"
3843,<mark> Members on both sides of the House will support new clause 2</mark>
3844,<mark> I will focus my comments on part 1</mark>
3845,"<mark> Clause 9 provides the Government with dangerous and unprecedented powers to deprive UK nationals of citizenship, without warning</mark>"
3846,"<mark> Through clause 9, the Government seek to amend the longstanding position under the British Nationality Act 1981 that an individual must be notified if they are to be deprived of their nationality</mark>"
3847,"<mark>I am a cosignatory to new clause 4, and I congratulate the hon</mark>"
3848,<mark>I rise to speak to amendment 12 to clause 9</mark>
3849,"<mark> The UK was a very different country in the 1970s, when racism and farright marches were common and Idi Amin had just thrown the Asians out of Uganda</mark>"
3850,"<mark> Clause 9 alters the requirement for the Home Secretary to serve notice on a person in cases where this would be impracticable, such as if they are in hiding or in the middle of a warzone</mark>"
3851,<mark> I will speak against new clause 12 and in favour of clause 9</mark>
3852,"<mark>The Government very much recognise the challenge that people are facing, which is why we have introduced a range of interventions, including the warm home discount; the household support fund, giving £500 million to local authorities to distribute; changes to the taper rate; and an increase in the national living wage</mark>"
3853,<mark> Households in the lowest income decile receive on average more than £4 in public spending for every £1 that they pay in tax</mark>
3854,<mark> Crimes linked to drugs in Scotland cost £750 million a year to investigate and prosecute</mark>
3855,<mark> I would add that the recent Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland reports in August showed that the deficit last year for the Scottish budget was £36</mark>
3856,<mark>3 billion</mark>
3857,<mark>The uplift in universal credit was always intended to be temporaryit was to help claimants through the economic shock and financial disruption of the pandemicand we now have the kickstart programme and a multibillionpound plan for jobs</mark>
3858,"<mark> I understand it is difficult to break a manifesto promise, and the Prime Minister was clear that he was doing that in raising national insurance, but he also had a manifesto promise to address social care, which, since Tony Blair said he would address it in 1997, has not been done</mark>"
3859,"<mark> Data from Public Health England estimates that two doses of a covid19 vaccine offers protection of around 96% against hospitalisation and that our jabs have prevented over 100,000 deaths, over 143,000 hospitalisations and around 24 million infections</mark>"
3860,<mark> Some 88% of people have had one jab and more than 80% of people aged 16 and over have now had the protection of both doses</mark>
3861,"<mark> The strength of support was over £14 billion during the covid crisis, and the furlough support helped 900,000 jobs in Scotland at the height of the pandemic, which is nearly a third of the Scottish workforce</mark>"
3862,<mark> The top 20% of households by income will pay 40 times what the poorest 20% pay; the top 40% will pay half of the entire levy</mark>
3863,"<mark> In 2018, the current shadow Minister for Social Care, the hon</mark>"
3864,"<mark>Over the summer, new data published by the SNP Scottish Government showed the Union dividend to be worth £2,210 a person in Scotland</mark>"
3865,<mark> Citizens Advice Scotland says that more than half those people are worried about being able to buy food</mark>
3866,"<mark> The Joseph Rowntree Foundation says that about 150,000 working families on low incomes in Scotland will pay an average of £100 extra in tax while losing £1,000</mark>"
3867,"<mark> What advice does the Secretary of State give those families on low incomes on where they should cut £1,100 from their family budgets</mark>"
3868,<mark> The proportion of schools rated as good or outstanding by Ofsted has risen from 68% in 2010 to 86% in 2020</mark>
3869,"<mark> Between 2011 and 2019, the attainment gap between disadvantaged children and their wealthier peers narrowed by 13% at age 11 and 9% at age 16</mark>"
3870,"<mark> In 2019, 82% of year 1 pupils met the expected standard for reading, compared with just 58% when the lighttouch phonics check was introduced</mark>"
3871,<mark> Over half of children are now educated in academies and 42% of schools are now academies</mark>
3872,"<mark> Some 84% of academies are part of multiacademy trusts, or MATs, and as of August last year, there were 1,180 MATs, covering 7,680 academies between them</mark>"
3873,"<mark> Of those, 70% oversee six schools or fewer, and 38% run two or three schools</mark>"
3874,"<mark> Over the years, various scandals have appeared in the papers, such as trusts paying for the lease of a new Jaguar for their chief executive, trusts paying thousands for firstclass travel and highclass hotel rooms, and even trusts paying for transatlantic flights</mark>"
3875,"<mark> We regularly hear of trusts chief executives getting huge salaries of £100,000 or £200,000and, in some cases, close to half a million pounds</mark>"
3876,"<mark> Having previously been placed in special measures, Whitfield Valley Primary Academy in Fegg Hayes in my StokeonTrent North, Kidsgrove and Talke constituency is now rated good by Ofsted, and with outstanding leadership, since becoming part of the Inspirational Learning Academies Trust in 2015</mark>"
3877,"<mark> I thank the previous Education Committee, which in a 2017 report found that there was a gap in assessing the performance of MATs not fulfilled by either Ofsted or regional school commissioners</mark>"
3878,"<mark> In 2018, Ofsted trialled a new approach to inspecting academies that involved a number of inspections of individual academies from a MAT taking place over a period of up to two terms</mark>"
3879,"<mark> In 2015, we saw the scrapping of plans for a carbon capture and underground storage plant in Peterhead, so I am simply seeking reassurance from the Secretary of State that the Acorn project will be one of two clusters to receive backing from his Government next month</mark>"
3880,"<mark> We want Acorn to be one of the tier 1 projects, and we are pressing for that</mark>"
3881,"<mark>On Cambo, all our North sea oil licences are factored into the 2050 net zero plan</mark>"
3882,"<mark> Last week, I had, as others have, constituents contact me on behalf of people who they served with in Afghanistan</mark>"
3883,"<mark> There is hardly any time in this debate, and the votes will come no later than 9</mark>"
3884,"<mark> It is intended to strengthen the security and resilience of all our public telecoms networks, be they fixed line or mobile2G, 3G, 4G, 5G and beyond</mark>"
3885,"<mark> We have been insistent on this position, and that is why I ask that this House disagrees with Lords amendment 4</mark>"
3886,"<mark> As I have set out, however, it would be inappropriate to agree to Lords amendments 4 and 5</mark>"
3887,"<mark> I commend Lords amendments 1, 2 and 3 to the House and ask that the House disagrees with Lords amendments 4 and 5</mark>"
3888,"<mark> Friend also agree that this did not come as a great shock to the Government It was all laid out in the 2013 Intelligence and Security Committee report on critical national infrastructure, but nothing has been done since then</mark>"
3889,<mark> We agreed that the entirety of Lords amendments 1 to 3 was broadly beneficial</mark>
3890,<mark> We looked at Lords amendment 5 and we understood the temptation to flag up the importance of the Five Eyes relationship</mark>
3891,<mark> That leaves us with Lords amendment 4</mark>
3892,"<mark> Therefore, like the Chairman of our parallel Committee, I will not be voting against Lords amendment 4 tonight</mark>"
3893,"<mark> That is what the Government promised in 2013 when the legislation was originally put through, for our Committees powers, and it is a promise that we expect them to keep</mark>"
3894,<mark> Lords amendment 4 on the diversification strategy is vital</mark>
3895,"<mark> When people try to give the impression that the issue of telecoms security suddenly hit us like a bolt out of the blue because of Huawei, I suggest that they read the 2013 ISC report on critical national infrastructure</mark>"
3896,"<mark> It is now in the hands of the Prime Minister to ensure that the memorandum of understanding is amended and is, as the Chair of the ISC said, in line with the Justice and Security Act 2013, which envisaged that we would have oversight if security went into other areas</mark>"
3897,"<mark> With regard to Lords amendment 5 on Five Eyes review, we believe that the intelligence community will naturally  consider the views of Five Eyes partners as part of its reporting, so the new clause, although worthy, is not really necessary</mark>"
3898,"<mark> In December, David Fuller was charged with the murder of two young women, Wendy Knell and Caroline Pierce, in the Tunbridge Wells area of Kent in 1987</mark>"
3899,"<mark> However, Lords amendment 4 on network diversification is very strong, and I am minded not to support the Government on it tonight</mark>"
3900,<mark> Two consequential amendments to Lords amendment 1 set out the conditions for the 40day scrutiny period and ensure that that time cannot be disrupted by recess or Prorogation so that this House and the other place have sufficient time to scrutinise the code</mark>
3901,"<mark> In 2010 the Tories inherited a secure, competitive and worldleading network</mark>"
3902,"<mark> However, I will take the opportunity to set out the SNPs views on Lords amendments 4 and 5 and, importantly, briefly to reflect on why we are in the situation that we are in</mark>"
3903,"<mark> Actually, that kind of ties in to Lords amendment 5 it is because of the mess that the Government have created in relation to Huawei</mark>"
3904,"<mark> I respectfully suggest that, in relation to Lords amendment 5, it is almost akin to the fact that they have learned nothing</mark>"
3905,"<mark> That, from my perspective, simply does not cut it, especially, as we have heard, when some £2 billion has already been wasted on this debacle, notwithstanding the economic impact of being so many years behind in the rollout of 5G itself</mark>"
3906,"<mark> That, in many senses, covers Lords amendment 5</mark>"
3907,"<mark> If I got the scope of it correctly, she was saying that Lords amendment 4 is far too narrow and would make the Governments life too difficult</mark>"
3908,<mark> Any guidance issued must be consistent with the duty in paragraph 17 of schedule 1 for the Secretary of State to have regard to the need to protect the independence of the OEP</mark>
3909,"<mark> The decisions of organisations such as the Centre for  Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, which employs hundreds of worldleading marine scientists, will be based on deep expertise and often highly technical scientific data</mark>"
3910,"<mark> Enforcement was a key part of the Dukes amendment and our version goes further, because it will dock in with the existing enforcement regime in the Water Industry Act 1991</mark>"
3911,"<mark> Ofwat can issue enforcement notices that can direct specific actions or fine companies up to 10% of their annual turnover, running to millions of pounds</mark>"
3912,"<mark> It estimated that the complete elimination of sewage discharges through storm overflows in England, which many are calling for more broadly, is likely to cost between approximately £350 billion and £600 billion</mark>"
3913,"<mark> That could mean up to £1,000 on bills every year</mark>"
3914,"<mark> I thank the Minister and the Secretary of State for their time speaking to the Opposition about the issue, and I am grateful for the Ministers words today putting our concerns on record, but I have to say that publishing an amendment at 5 pm last Friday did not really build trust, either among Members on both sides of the House who wanted to see the detail or among the stakeholders who were looking forward to scrutinising carefully what the Minister had to say</mark>"
3915,"<mark> It is not sufficient to say, To deal with this properly will cost £600 billion, but to deal with tinkering around the edges will cost hardly anything on the side, and pretend that those are fair options to choose between</mark>"
3916,"<mark> Although we have our own problems with outdated Victorian sewer systems struggling to cope with the once in a hundred years events that now seem to be occurring every two to three years, the fact remains that any profits made by Scottish Water are invested in the services and infrastructure of Scotlands waterways rather than the pockets of shareholders, and that Scottish Water does not carry the stratospheric levels of debt carried by English water companiesand that is the way the people of Scotland like it too</mark>"
3917,<mark>2 miles along it</mark>
3918,"<mark> Yet again, the Minister quotes the £600 billion cost that she says dealing with the problem will cause, but the water companies say the cost is in the region of £13 billion to £20 billion using concrete storage tanks, or £20 billion to £30 billion more if they are accompanied by natural drainage schemes that bring wider community benefits</mark>"
3919,<mark> That compares with the £1</mark>
3920,<mark>2 billion already being spent by industry on overflows between 2020 and 2025</mark>
3921,"<mark> Currently, a water company dumps 40% of all the phosphates in Windermere</mark>"
3922,"<mark> If that goes down to 39%, there is no measure to say whether that is okay, so I assume the water companies will think that it is okay</mark>"
3923,<mark>We have been two and a quarter years bringing this enormous Bill through Parliament</mark>
3924,"<mark>I beg to move, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 4</mark>"
3925,"<mark> Lords amendments 1 to 3 were tabled by my colleague in the other place, Lord Parkinson</mark>"
3926,<mark> Lords amendment 4 relates to reporting on supply chain diversification and Lords amendment 5 relates to reviewing actions taken by Five Eyes nations regarding highrisk vendors</mark>
3927,<mark> I will speak first to Lords amendments 1 to 3</mark>
3928,"<mark> We carefully considered the Committees recommendation over the summer, and tabled amendments 1 to 3 in the other place to accept them</mark>"
3929,<mark> 1056</mark>
3930,"<mark> Gentleman and the House that we only have two suppliers for 5G now, but the technology is evolving and there are new technologies for the next generation of networks6G</mark>"
3931,"<mark>I rise to speak in favour of Lords amendment 5, which was tabled by Lord Alton and Lord Blencathra</mark>"
3932,<mark> I believe that Lords amendment 5 would further strengthen our ties with those great allies and ensure that we look to the future of the security and resilience of our telecommunications network</mark>
3933,"<mark> I hope that this House will approve amendment 5, as it will send a clear message that technology companies that work against our national interest will not be allowed to operate in the United Kingdom</mark>"
3934,<mark> Friend the Minister about Lords amendment 4</mark>
3935,"<mark> Lords amendment 4 does have merits, because it recognises that there is a real problem about diversification</mark>"
3936,"<mark>I rise to speak in favour of Lords amendment 5, which was championed in the other place by my Friend, Lord Alton and which focuses on the Five Eyes partnership</mark>"
3937,"<mark> I also urge the Minister, if she has the time, to read the Uyghur forced labour in Xinjiang and UK value chains report, and in particular to focus on article 7 of Chinas national intelligence law, which states that any company that is registered in China has to provide data to the Chinese Communist party on demand, and also to deny to any other state that it is doing so</mark>"
3938,"<mark> We are investing to ensure that we level up in Northern Ireland, with £60 million this year from the levellingup fund, the community renewal fund and the community ownership fund, as well as £400 million from the new deal for Northern Ireland and more than £600 million in city and growth deal investment to drive growth</mark>"
3939,<mark> The best estimates are that hundreds of suicides every year are of people living with a terminal illness</mark>
3940,"<mark> Friend mentioned, assisted dying has been legal for a quarter of a century, and the eligibility criteria and processes remain essentially the same as the day they were introduced</mark>"
3941,"<mark> Two weeks ago, the States Assembly of Jersey voted by a large margin of 36 votes to 10 in support of a proposition on assisted dying, with draft legislation to be introduced by 2023</mark>"
3942,"<mark> A widely signed petition led to the establishment of a citizens jury of islanders, which found that more than 75% of participants wanted to legalise assisted dying</mark>"
3943,"<mark> Dignity means different things to different people, but as the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman pointed out in a 2014 report, there are some key actions to ensure that people have dignity at the end of life They include allowing patient choice through appropriate care planning and promoting good and timely communication, with patients and their families and between the people and organisations supporting them</mark>"
3944,"<mark> We are boosting local economies through city and growth deals and providing, along with the Northern Ireland Executive, a UK contribution of more than £730 million to the Peace Plus programme to contribute to a more prosperous and stable Northern Ireland</mark>"
3945,"<mark> I recognise the extraordinary pain and distress of those individuals and their families, but is he aware that in Oregonthe legislation being proposed in the other place is based on the law thereover half the people who apply for assisted death do so not because of terrible pain and suffering, but because they do not want to be a burden on their family That is the consideration that motivates them</mark>"
3946,"<mark> The Prime Minister announced the towns fund; the Chancellor set out a landmark £4 billion levellingup fund for investment in the infrastructure of everyday life; there is the UK shared prosperity fund, to support communities after Brexit; and now we have a Department focused on delivering our levellingup mission, so that every community across the country can benefit from the policies of this Government</mark>"
3947,"<mark> Recent polling from Survation found that two thirds of residents in leftbehind neighbourhoods felt that their neighbourhood was missing out on community facilities; over half said that their area had fewer resources, such as parks, leisure and sports facilities, and places to meet</mark>"
3948,"<mark> As importantly, almost 60% of residents said that they wanted more of a say in how future funding in their area was spent</mark>"
3949,"<mark> As we heard in the Chamber on Monday, the expanded dormant assets scheme provides almost £900 million, which could initially be used for this fund, so there would be no drain on the public purse</mark>"
3950,<mark>This week thousands of my Hindu constituents and millions worldwide start the celebrations of the birth centenary of His Holiness Mahant Swami Maharaj</mark>
3951,<mark> He was of course the inspiration behind the worldrenowned Neasden temple and hundreds of other temples</mark>

3953,"<mark> However, if his proposals are to secure any traction, they will have to be compliant with article 2, and we will have to see a fully fleshed out plan for truth and reconciliation</mark>"
3954,"<mark> We are determined to deliver on that, and we are determined to ensure that what we deliver is article 2 compliant</mark>"
3955,"<mark> Rather than delayingthe Secretary of State did promise it in the autumn and he did promise it before Christmas, and it has not emergedcan he give a clear assurance, on behalf of the victims, that he has gone back to the drawing board and will only return with proposals once victims are front and centre and in the driving seat That is what they deserve, and that is what Governments should deliver for them</mark>"

3957,"<mark> I must be clear if HS2 ever gets as far north as us in Lancashire and Cumbria, which seems like something of a long shot, we cannot have trains not stopping in Lancaster</mark>"

3959,"<mark> 1 question that I am asked as a local MPwhere is our railway in Fleetwood The track bed is there, but there are no trains running up and down it</mark>"
3960,"<mark>Much to the Prime Ministers presumed disappointment, his proposed bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland has been rejected as impossible to justify by his own advisers, as it would cost £300 billion, 22 times more than the Prime Ministers estimates</mark>"
3961,<mark> Member for giving me notice of the point of order on behalf of her constituents</mark>

4107,<mark> The British Government commissioned a parliamentary blue book in 1916 to document the Armenian genocide</mark>
4108,<mark> The word genocide was first coined by the Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin in 1944</mark>
4109,"<mark> It was first recognised as a crime under international law in 1946 by the UN General Assembly and codified as an independent crime in the 1948 convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide, which came into effect in 1951</mark>"

4122,<mark> I well remember our chaperone in Sarajevo telling me how she had been shot in the leg by a sniper in the 1990s when she was a small child</mark>
4123,"<mark> After the devastating conflict of the 1990s, the region has lived in peace for 26 years, and the Dayton political system, which should have been used to deliver progress and development for citizens, has been exploited by politicians who are focused on building and maintaining their own position</mark>"

4141,"<mark> Last week, we received a 40page response from the MOD, and I am grateful to the Backbench Business Committee for granting the time for this statement, which gives me the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Defence Committee</mark>"
4142,"<mark> Thanks to that decision, just short of 10% of the female serving population came forward to give their accounts</mark>"
4143,"<mark> I put on the record my most sincere thanks to the 4,106 women and veterans who completed our survey, in addition to the 76 pieces of oral and written evidence that we received</mark>"
4144,"<mark> In fact, 62% of the women surveyed said that they had experienced abuse while serving</mark>"
4145,"<mark> We recommended policies to improve family and personal life, including the swift rollout of wraparound childcare to all bases and all services by the end of 2022, and a more flexible working environment</mark>"
4146,"<mark> I wish personally to thank Paula Edwards, who runs the charity, for giving evidence to the inquiry and then supporting the extra 147 new referralsin addition to the 1,800 women she currently supportsas a result of the inquiry</mark>"
4147,"<mark> I am pleased about the aspirational target of having 30% women in the armed forces by 2030, showing ongoing commitment to our servicewomen</mark>"
4148,"<mark> The Governments response to the Committees report says that many women do not experience harassment, but they are concerned that 11% of women in the services faced sexual harassment last year</mark>"
4149,<mark> Some 62% of our survey respondents had received some sort of abuse</mark>
4150,"<mark> We also have the Wigston review, and I am pleased to say that, in its response, the MOD says that it will give a thorough review of its recommendations in, I believe, 2023</mark>"
4151,"<mark> With only 16% of cases having any forensic evidence taken, how can we expect cases to get to the courts for a conviction That in itself is a problem, as is the lack of victim support</mark>"
4152,"<mark> Your daughter calls the next one, and they ask for 1,000 up front and all documents in the case</mark>"

4158,"<mark> About 5,000 British nationals are arrested or detained overseas each year, and providing nonjudgmental support for prisoners is a large part of our role</mark>"
4159,"<mark> Our contact centres receive about 500,000 inquiries each year, and more than 85% are resolved in the first call</mark>"
4160,"<mark> In 2020 we handled more than 3,000 cases involving deaths abroad, although many of our staff around the world were working through lockdown themselves</mark>"

4177,<mark> One cannot make a building half safe</mark>
4178,"<mark> The Secretary of State is now on track to miss the deadline to fix all Grenfellstyle cladding by over half a decade, and there are huge delays when it comes to building safety fund applications, so will he get a grip on what is going on in his own Department and ensure that the progress of remediation is accelerated markedly As he knows, this has been a living nightmare for affected leaseholders, and we owe it to them to bring it swiftly to an end</mark>"
4179,"<mark> I believe that the Association of British Insurers should be told that the Competition and Markets Authority will look to see whether there is price gouging, in simple terms, and, that if there is some kind of catastrophic reinsurance needed, the Government should help them to make communal arrangements to deal with that, because insurance premiums should come down to the £300 they were before</mark>"

4190,"<mark>It became very clear after 2014 that Ukraine had lost large parts of its navy to Russias illegal occupation of Crimea, and it is important to help Ukraine build up and sustain a naval capability</mark>"
4191,"<mark> What will the Government do if conviction rates for one or more of these serious crimes are concerningly low Will the Government reconsider their approach and finally recognise that these cases should be dealt with by the civilian judicial system, and what impact does the Minister think that the Armed Forces Act 2021 will have on the Government meeting the target they have set themselves for 30% of Army recruits to be</mark>"
4192,<mark> It has been four and a half years</mark>
4193,"<mark> More than 5,000 ARAPeligible personnel were brought out during Operation Pitting, and around 1,100 of the 2,000 who have come out since are also ARAPers</mark>"
4194,<mark> Friend share my gratitude to the excellent staff at Permanent Joint Headquarters at Northwood in my constituency for their superb leadership and focus on our overseas operations</mark>
4195,"<mark>Since the veterans strategy was published in 2018, we have been delivering for our veterans, including Op Courage in the NHS to support veterans with their mental health, the veterans railcard, and a national insurance holiday for those employing veterans</mark>"
4196,"<mark>A retired teacher in my constituency invested in a property in 2015, but just before Christmas, they were issued with a  massive bill for £200,000 for an increase in their costs, and remedial work on their property will cost a possible £9 million</mark>"
4197,"<mark> However, let me go back to insurers not only are they increasing premiums by up to 1,000% for people who cannot really afford the premiums that they were paying before, but insurers are part of the problem</mark>"
4198,"<mark> Friend the Member  for Hemel Hempstead Sir Mike Penning said, thousands of people will have received large bills and many will have paid them</mark>"
4199,"<mark> On his very important point, I hope that the withdrawal of the consolidated advice note and its replacement with the BSIapproved PAS 9980 will play a part in helping his constituents  and others to be in a position once again to operate fully in the property market</mark>"
4200,"<mark> The Secretary of State recognised that in the statement by referring to the extra £27 million for waking watches, but leaseholders will have already paid out thousands of pounds for waking watches</mark>"
4201,"<mark> Gentleman outline what steps he is willing to put in place to ensure that the burden of the cost of replacing cladding is not on the tenants alone Too many tenants of onebedroom apartments are being asked to pay thousands of pounds towards this from low wages, while developers are sitting pretty</mark>"
4202,"<mark>Since last April, I have been seeking answers for a constituent in Cambuslang who has been trying to sell a flat between 11 metres and 18 metres, which was wrongly assessed to have failed the EWS1 form because of cladding</mark>"
4203,"<mark> On the question of employment, there are some 4,100 jobs across the country in 230 companies, and the programme is particularly important to south Wales</mark>"
4204,<mark> I say that because it is emblematic of a catalogue of wasteful decisions such as the selling off of the Royal Naval Hospital Haslar in 2009 for £3 million when it had reportedly been valued at £52 million</mark>
4205,"<mark> I think it passed maingate business approval in March 2010, around the same time that the National Audit Office was pointing out the multibillion pound black hole that the Labour party was leaving in Defence at the time</mark>"
4206,"<mark> I do not believe that Fort Blockhouse will be disposed of until 2023, so there is time to get it right</mark>"
4207,"<mark> More than 2,000 people have come to the UK since the end of Operation Pitting, and we continue to work with partners in the region to facilitate the exit of more, through more routes</mark>"
4208,"<mark> Tens of thousands dead, millions facing humanitarian disaster, democracy and human rights in tatters, and many of billions of pounds spentif that does not merit a full, comprehensive independent inquiry, what on earth does</mark>"
4209,<mark> Friend that speed and delivery here is critical It is now four and a half years since the tragedy in my constituency</mark>
4210,"<mark> This project matters for our military capability and for the 4,000strong workforce in south Wales and across the UK</mark>"
4211,<mark> I urge the House to reject new clause 1 and amendments 1 to 10</mark>
4212,"<mark>That the draft International Organization for Marine Aids to Navigation Legal Capacities Order 2022, which was laid before this House on 2 November 2021, be approved</mark>"

4214,"<mark>1 billion of taxpayers funding from the Government, but we should not now look to the taxpayer for more funding</mark>"
4215,<mark> He and I will know that the seven major housing developers do much good work but that in the last three years they made profits of £16 billion</mark>
4216,"<mark> This is a victory for leaseholders, who will get up to £9 billion of support</mark>"
4217,<mark> Far too many leaseholders have been waiting for three and half years in purdah</mark>
4218,"<mark> Meanwhile, the residents have been paying out £28,000 a month for waking watch for nearly four years</mark>"
4219,"<mark> Will we see an end to the EWS1 forms or will RICS come back at us and say that we cannot possibly do that, as it has done before</mark>"
4220,<mark> I know that this announcement and this progress will be welcomed by residents of Vizion apartments in Milton Keynes as well as by thousands and thousands of others across the country</mark>
4221,"<mark> Will there be a Government guaranteea letter or similar that they can use with estate agents and othersso that they can move on with their lives Finally, residents in a Putney building of just under 11 metres have been given a bill of £1 million for remediation</mark>"
4222,<mark> Friend on behalf of constituents who face those imminent bills</mark>
4223,<mark>It is four and a half years since Grenfell</mark>
4224,<mark> That is simply not good enough for the thousands of leaseholders affected in Southwark</mark>
4225,"<mark> Will he answer that point, bearing in mind that the biggest social landlords have said that their new housing programmes will be cut by 40% over the next five years if they have to cover fire safety costs themselves Affordable housing is at particular risk, as yesterdays fire in New York showed</mark>"
4226,"<mark> Can he provide reassurance to residents such as those in Banning Street in Romsey, where the building is sub18 metres,  the freeholder is a housing association and the defects are cladding related, that they will be swept up in his reforms They are looking at costs of £15,000 to £20,000 per leaseholder for new fire escapes, which may well not even be needed</mark>"
4227,"<mark> For so many of those people, lack of an EWS1 form means that they cannot movethey are absolutely trapped</mark>"
4228,<mark> The managing agents failed to make an application to the initial £1</mark>
4229,<mark>6 billion building safety fund</mark>
4230,<mark> I was told in June that a new fund of £3</mark>
4231,"<mark>5 billion would be coming forward, but that is yet to materialise and leaseholders are already having to pay over £2,000 each towards the cost of this exercise</mark>"
4232,"<mark>The shadow Secretary of State said that we cannot make a building half safe, but some residential buildings are possibly more dangerous than others</mark>"
4233,"<mark>With the leave of the House, we will take motions 6 and 7 together</mark>"
4234,"<mark> 83A7,</mark>"
4235,"<mark> Member has made a powerful intervention on behalf of that cluster, which I am going to come up to see</mark>"
4236,"<mark>Will the Minister look at the opportunities to manage Britains longest river, the River Severn We believe that, if an holistic solution were found to managing Britains longest river, there would be a gross value added uplift in the west midlands of more than £150 billion</mark>"
4237,"<mark> This month, research published in The Lancet found that by 2050 worldwide dementia cases will treble and cases will go up by 75% in the UK</mark>"
4238,"<mark> In the CSR, we announced another £340 million for motor neurone disease research</mark>"
4239,"<mark> There are the winter fuel payments, as the hon Gentleman well knows, and £300 for 8 million pensioners is worth £2 billion</mark>"
4240,<mark>30am and 2</mark>
4241,"<mark>The University of Sheffields new gene therapy innovation and manufacturing centre shows that South Yorkshire can lead the world when it comes to research, but nearly half of all RD spending goes into the golden triangle</mark>"
4242,"<mark>I am sure that the Secretary of State is aware that offgrid customers gas and oil supplies are not covered by the price cap, and that they will therefore experience even higher price fuel price increases this spring than the £600 or so now predicted for ongrid customers</mark>"

4745,"<mark> 1400, 1415 and 1416 are without question relatively modest, certainly by comparison with the restrictions that currently apply in similar jurisdictions, and it is a very good thing that they will fall on 26 January</mark>"

4758,<mark> Friend has been fighting on behalf of her constituents</mark>
4759,"<mark> How on earth are we supposed to trust that the Government are dealing with the serious security threats we face or the evacuation of thousands whose lives are urgently at risk if they cannot even keep a promise to reply to emails Quite simply, it is Parliaments job to get answers to those questions, and the Opposition believe that we need proper tools to do it</mark>"
4760,<mark> There are 37 million Afghans now living under a Taliban regime</mark>
4761,"<mark> Pakistan is, for instance, home to 3 million Afghan refugees already and is being asked to take more when the UK has capped its contribution at 5,000 over the next year</mark>"
4762,"<mark> Will he join me in welcoming the Welsh Labour Governments £20 million commitment to the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre in Broughton, in the constituency of my right hon</mark>"
4763,"<mark> In the space of just two weeks, we evacuated around 8,000 British nationals, around 5,000 Afghans under the ARAP scheme, and around 500 Afghan special cases, including judges, Chevening scholars, journalists and womens rights activists</mark>"
4764,"<mark> That is in addition to the 1,978 Afghans evacuated through the ARAP scheme between April, when we started the scheme, and the end of August</mark>"
4765,"<mark> It is painful to watch what has gone on in Afghanistan, but we should remember that 10 million more children have been educated and 8 million landmines have been cleared because of our intervention</mark>"
4766,<mark> Now we are told that all that documentation of thousands of desperate lives has gone into a black hole</mark>
4767,"<mark> As early as 2009, President Obama had to send 17,000 more troops to counter that resurgence</mark>"
4768,"<mark> The fact that the proposed Committee would have the power to compel Ministers to attend means, on balance, that it would be possible to have detailed consideration of UK Government policy on Afghanistan by the proposed deadline of March 2022</mark>"
4769,"<mark> I can only say with any certainty that there were two families who got out of Kabul who would not have done so without our intervention, despite those hundreds of hours of effort</mark>"
4770,<mark> I  opposed the 2001 offensive</mark>

4772,<mark>Let me start by echoing the heartfelt sympathy expressed throughout the House for the thousands of Afghans who have been forced to flee tyranny and oppression</mark>
4773,<mark> 1107</mark>
4774,"<mark> Meanwhile, hundreds of British nationals and ARAPeligible Afghans remain on the ground</mark>"
4775,"<mark> It was worth it to go to Afghanistan in 2001 to get rid of alQaeda, it was worth it to spend the long years of hard sacrifice and service in Helmand province to expand education and security alongside our courageous interpreters, and it was worth it when the rising tide of geopolitics meant that we had to leave Afghanistan</mark>"
4776,<mark> I hope he has taken note of the £20 million commitment to the south Wales industrial cluster</mark>
4777,"<mark> There is not much that the Scottish Government can do about that when 85% of all social security spending rests here, but there is something that the Scottish people can do about that they can choose not to go on living in this state with this Tory Government</mark>"
4778,"<mark> We may never know the true effect of all the mismanagement, but the suggestion that 9,000 eligible Afghans entitled to settle in the UK have been left behind does nothing to ease the worried minds of my constituents</mark>"
4779,<mark>rather than seek to pursue cases on their behalf</mark>
4780,<mark> This is the biggest disaster since 1956</mark>
4781,<mark> Friend for her work on behalf of her constituents and their family members in Afghanistan</mark>
4782,"<mark> We deserve to know why the Foreign Office crisis centre was set up after Kabul had fallen, why crucial papers identifying local employees were left abandoned on an embassy floor and why thousands of emails from Members of this House addressing urgent cases are sitting unopened and unread in inboxes</mark>"
4783,"<mark> We are so grateful to the soldiers, diplomats and civil servants who flew into danger to evacuate thousands as part of Operation Pittingthey remind us what courage looks likebut they are heartbroken at how many people were left behind</mark>"
4784,"<mark> However, I can tell the House that, by tomorrow, the FCDO will have contacted more than half the hon</mark>"

4786,"<mark> In 2010, she was kidnapped by the Taliban and killed</mark>"
4787,"<mark> When the Government claim they are announcing additional aid, they must be clear whether that is genuinely additional to all the aid flows already committed, or whether they are still operating within their envelope of 0</mark>"
4788,"<mark>5% of GNI, in which case whatever money is being diverted to Afghanistan is coming from other places that also badly need it</mark>"
4789,<mark> The chaotic end to 20 years in Afghanistan left hundreds of British citizens and thousands of Afghans behind</mark>
4790,"<mark> Two decades of work, the transformation of the economy through landmine clearance, the improvements to healthcare, media freedom and the education of millions of girls are now at risk as the Taliban regime returns</mark>"
4791,"<mark> While it is not necessarily the duty of Members of the House to understand the machinery of government, it is worth while them understanding that, when the Foreign Office has received emails, sometimes with the details of hundreds of individual cases, it is very difficult at times even to doublecheck to see whether those details have already been passed to us</mark>"
4792,"<mark> I would also quibble with paragraph 1aii, because I think that there would be quite a lot of overlap with the Intelligence and Security Committee, a point that has been dealt with already</mark>"
4793,<mark>  Four hundred and fiftysix service personnel lost their lives</mark>
4794,"<mark> We have not said sorry either to our taxpayers, who funded this to the tune of many billions of pounds</mark>"
4795,"<mark> My staff are now supporting 1,400 people in Afghanistan, the loved ones and family members of people in Birmingham, Hodge Hill constituency</mark>"
4796,"<mark> Some 1,600 refugees are currently being supported in our city, and I want to put on record my thanks to Councillor John Cotton and his team for their extraordinary work</mark>"
4797,<mark> I am told that that local authority has supported just one asylum seeker since 2016</mark>
4798,"<mark> We have no updates on the 1,400 cases we have filed for</mark>"

4803,"<mark> The appeal helps to fund the Royal British Legions work in raising funds for the armed forces covenant, providing support for thousands of service people and their families</mark>"
4804,"<mark> The two trials we have seen under the national security law have already demonstrated the export and establishment of Chinas judicial system in Hong Kong, with suspects denied bail on spurious grounds, judges handpicked by Beijing and one individual receiving a sentence of six and a half years in jail simply for carrying a flag with a prodemocracy slogan on it</mark>"
4805,"<mark> Gentleman talked about, the Chief of the Defence Staffs comments to the Select Committee represented the situation at the end of the transition, but all the way through that transition the UKs premier armoured division, 3 Division, will have battlewinning capabilities and the ability to take on Russia as part of a NATO commitment</mark>"
4806,"<mark> The joint declaration made it clear that Hong Kongs high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms would remain unchanged for 50 years from 1997</mark>"
4807,"<mark>Does the Minister accept, though, that there is confusion and contradiction in the UK Governments portrayal of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, with the former Foreign Secretary saying that the Taliban takeover was faster than anyone anticipated while the Prime Minister was saying that it had been clear for many months that the situation could change quickly Army personnel faced the heartbreaking task of turning back thousands of Afghan citizens, including many who worked with groups such as the British Council</mark>"
4808,"<mark> From memory, I think we removed about 1,500 people before Kabul fell</mark>"
4809,"<mark>The Veterans Charity, which is based in North Devon, helps hundreds of veterans across the UK each year, and would like to thank the MOD for supporting its routes of remembrance event, which involved many veterans and service personnel around  the nation</mark>"
4810,"<mark> Does he not agree that the closure of not only Amnesty Internationals offices in Hong Kong but those of all human rights organisations that are highlyand rightlycritical of the horrific human rights abuses still taking place in China typifies the disregard that China has shown to the 1984 SinoBritish joint declaration and the 1992 United StatesHong Kong Policy Act Does he agree that through this debate and the Ministers response we must make it clear that the House stands with Hong Kongs citizens and those who fight for freedom in a democratic, peaceful way</mark>"
4811,<mark> The BNO route reflects the UKs historic and moral commitment to those who retained ties to the UK by taking out BNO status at the point of Hong Kongs handover to China in 1997</mark>
4812,<mark>4 Proceedings on Consideration shall so far as not previously concluded be brought to a conclusion one hour before the moment of interruption on the day on which those proceedings are commenced</mark>
4813,"<mark>The fantastic work of the poppy appeal, which raises millions every year for our veterans, is only possible thanks to the hard work of the volunteers and armed forces who take part, giving up their time to ensure that the Royal British Legions fundraising efforts succeed</mark>"
4814,"<mark> It is indeed an allyearround challenge, and that is why we are pleased to have invested £25 million this year in third sector charities that support our veterans and armed forces</mark>"
4815,"<mark>Lady Haigs Poppy Factory in Edinburgh has been in operation since 1926, employing exsoldiers since the very beginning</mark>"
4816,<mark> We are rightly increasing the budget for Op Courage to more than £20 million this year</mark>
4817,"<mark> An ERB is a body with a plan to help the next gigafactory, the next offshore wind farm, the next nuclear plant and the next electric vehicle factory to find the workers with the skills they need; a body to help the retrofitters, the digital networkers and the constructors of HS2 to get the skills that my hon</mark>"

4819,<mark> What we see emerging is a new pathway to work for everyone at 1619</mark>
4820,"<mark> For students at level 3, there will be worldclass qualifications designed with employers leading to degreelevel apprenticeships, work and, yes, higher education, because more than 50 universities already accept our Tlevels</mark>"
4821,"<mark> For students who are at level 2 at 1619, there will be, thanks to our forthcoming consultation on level 2 and below, worldclass qualifications designed with employers leading to traineeships, apprenticeships or work, or, indeed, the opportunity to take up the Prime Ministers lifetime skills guarantee at level 3 and get the skills they want, that they might not have had the chance to gain at school</mark>"

4827,<mark>2 Proceedings in the Public Bill Committee shall so far as not previously concluded be brought to a conclusion on Thursday 20 January 2022</mark>
4828,"<mark> This can be seen by the scale of our investment, with more than £191 million of UK Government funding being invested directly in community projects across Scotland</mark>"
4829,"<mark> They  have also failed to explain how they cannot afford to act on their own, given that they have a record settlement this year of over £41 billion of block grantthe highest block grant settlement in real terms since devolution began</mark>"
4830,"<mark> This is a vital investment, and the Defence Secretary and I have been deeply concerned about progress on this troubled project, which has been running for over 11 years since its commencement in March 2010</mark>"
4831,"<mark> For example, an MOD safety notice in December 2018 said that design upgrades were required to reduce vibration, but this was not acted upon</mark>"
4832,<mark> Recommendation 9 relates to avoiding the concurrent running of the demonstration and manufacture stages in future projects</mark>
4833,"<mark> We have a robust, firm price contract for the delivery of 589 vehicles at a cost of £5</mark>"

4835,"<mark> It remains impossible to share with the House 100% confidence that the programme will succeed or, if it does, the timing of achieving full operating capability</mark>"
4836,"<mark> This very advanced fighting vehicle project employs 4,100 in south Wales and across the UK</mark>"
4837,"<mark>5 billion programme that has been running for the past 10 years, has only delivered a couple of dozen vehicles and still has no definite date for completion</mark>"
4838,"<mark> I cannot give a 100% guarantee, because one never can on a defence procurement programme, but we are a long way down the road on this programmeas we should be, given the number of years that it has taken to get us this far</mark>"
4839,<mark>4 Proceedings on Consideration shall so far as not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion one hour before the moment of interruption on the day on which proceedings on Consideration are commenced</mark>
4840,"<mark> As we have discussed, it is a £5 billion project that was expected in 2017, but only a dozen vehicles have arrived, and people are being sent to hospital because of the vibration problems</mark>"
4841,<mark> It makes it difficult for me to call for defence spending to be increased to 3% to improve our defence posture  because of the threats coming over the horizon when money is spent so poorly</mark>
4842,"<mark> A £41 billion programme of investment in equipment and support is going into the Army in the next 10 years, and £8 billion of that is new</mark>"
4843,"<mark> It provides helpful definition and sources for the catastrophic failuresnumerous as they arein the management control issues, which have come to define the literally incredible £5</mark>"
4844,<mark>5 billion defence procurement fiasco</mark>
4845,<mark> Friend is right this is a £5</mark>
4846,<mark>5 billion firmpriced contract</mark>
4847,<mark> I am very clear that we have a contract that says that 589 vehicles will be delivered that will meet our requirements for a price of £5</mark>
4848,<mark>5 billion</mark>
4849,"<mark> I see no reason why this  House or the taxpayer should pay more money to General Dynamics to produce 589 vehicles, when we have a contract for it to produce 589 vehicles to our requirements for £5</mark>"
4850,<mark>5 billion</mark>
4851,<mark> Gentleman is right that £3</mark>

4855,"<mark> We want a transition, and this Government are investing significantly, with £160 million in floating wind farms, £20 million for tidal stream and the £285 million next round of contracts for difference, but it is important that we do not lose our domestic oil and gas supply not only for energy, but for the whole range of purposes, including medicine and other vital products</mark>"

4858,<mark> Three hundred and fifteen votes were cast with no spoilt ballot papers</mark>
4859,<mark> Some 65% of people in Scotland say that the Prime Minister is totally corrupt and 65% of people in Scotland also believe he should resign</mark>
4860,"<mark> Given that this coincides with a surge in independence, with more than half of the population in Scotland now supporting independence and the Scottish National party, does the Secretary of State agree that the corruption of the UK Government is driving Scots away from the Union If he were truly interested in saving the Union, should he not be joining the rest of us in calling for the PMs resignation</mark>"

5080,<mark> Members who have taken part in the debate for their thoughtful contributions over the past threeandahalf hours</mark>
5081,"<mark> The Government not only support the intent of the motion, but take a tougher stance than the Opposition in advocating, as we do, recommendation 1 of the 2018 report by the Committee on Standards in Public Life</mark>"
5082,"<mark> Those recommendations, if they were to be adopted, would serve to allay the concerns that have been aired eloquently in this place and outside it, establish that the role of the MP continues to command the confidence of the general public, and ensure that the rules on outside activity reflect the fundamental principle enunciated eloquently by Edmund Burke in 1774 and many times since that, first and foremost, Members of Parliament have a duty to their constituents</mark>"

5090,"<mark>I beg to move an amendment, to leave out from House to the end of the Question and add acknowledges recent concern over the outside interests of Members of Parliament; believes the rules which apply to MPs must be up to date, effective and appropriately rigorous; recalls the 2018 report by the Committee on Standards in Public Life into this matter; believes that recommendations 1 and 10 in that report form the basis of a viable approach which could command the confidence of parliamentarians and the public; believes that these recommendations should be taken forward; and supports crossparty work, including that being done by the Houses Committee on Standards, to bring forward recommendations to update the Code of Conduct for MPs by 31 January 2022</mark>"

5095,"<mark> It is an appalling abuse, a corrupt House, and we should be looking at abolishing it, not putting more people in because they happen to give the Tory party £3 million</mark>"
5096,"<mark> Friend agree that it is easy to get rid of the stench of corruption, or perceived corruption even, of cash for honours the three party leaders who appoint to the House of Lords could simply say that they will not put in the Lords those who have donated over a certain sum of money over a certain period of timeperhaps £50,000 over five years</mark>"

5676,"<mark> Member for Chichester Gillian Keegan, who received the report on behalf of the Government</mark>"
5677,"<mark> In Wales, nearly half of all working women are over 50 and are likely to be experiencing the perimenopause or the menopause</mark>"
5678,"<mark> Although the Equality Act 2010 prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sex, research from the Wales TUC, which has done great work on this for many years and I commend it to the Minister, highlights how many women feel that managers simply do not recognise problems associated with the menopause in the way that they would for other health conditions, even those with similar symptoms arising from different causes</mark>"
5679,"<mark> In studies conducted ahead of the publication of its superb menopause toolkit, the Wales TUC found that almost a third of women with direct experience of the menopause felt that it was treated negatively in their workplace and nearly 60% reported witnessing the menopause being treated as a joke</mark>"
5680,<mark> That affects 3</mark>
5681,<mark>5 million people across the UK</mark>
5682,"<mark> Although people living with the disease can live a healthy life with prompt diagnosis and the right support, millions are suffering the consequences of longterm pain and even disability because of underdiagnosis and undertreatment</mark>"
5683,"<mark> Research from the Royal Osteoporosis Society shows that a quarter of osteoporosis sufferers will be living with longterm pain; that 71% have trouble with cleaning and cooking; and that 52% say the condition affects their ability to get around, to drive or to use public transport</mark>"
5684,"<mark> I implore Ministers to work with the ROS on its request for the Government to matchfund their research investment, as part of a muchneeded rebalancing of research investment towards musculoskeletal conditions, which account for 9% of the health burden, but a mere 3% of the research spend</mark>"

5689,"<mark> I can guarantee that mums on a tight budget will make sure that their kids have everything they need before finding  the £20 to pay for the prescription, which means that that cost is a real barrier for many women up and down the country</mark>"
5690,"<mark> Menopause training in medical schools is unacceptably poor, with 41% offering no mandatory menopause training at all</mark>"
5691,<mark> More than threequarters of menopausal women are now in employment</mark>
5692,<mark> Looking again at those responses and at the hundreds of emails coming into my inbox makes me realise just how many women out there are now ready to reach out and share their experiences</mark>
5693,"<mark> Goodness, anywhere can be difficult, but a recent survey carried out by the Fawcett Society on behalf of Standard Chartered and the Financial Services Skills Commission, specifically about women in finance who are experiencing  the menopause, highlighted some really stark findings</mark>"

5697,"<mark> Indeed, as colleagues have said, we now know that around one in 100 women in the UK will experience menopausal symptoms before they turn 40, and it is estimated that in total around 13 million women in the UK are currently perimenopausal or menopausal</mark>"
5698,<mark> It does not take a genius to work out that it will affect about half of us in our lifetimes</mark>

5843,"<mark> Currently,  around half of all older adults in care receive some state support for their care costs</mark>"
5844,<mark> This clause would also make a number of minor technical amendments to other sections of the Care Act 2014</mark>
5845,"<mark> Friend back to my previous point when compared to the current system, this is a significant improvement and step forward, particularly when taken in the round with the overall package of measures that see the floors go from £23,250 up to £100,000 and from £14,250 up to £20,000</mark>"
5846,"<mark> We are capping the amount that anyone will be forced to spend on personal care costs in their lifetime at £86,000</mark>"
5847,"<mark>On the point the Minister is making about the Dilnot proposals and a comparison, let me tell him that the Alzheimers Society said that 15% of people with dementia in the northwest would reach the cap under the Governments proposals, compared with 34% under Dilnots proposals</mark>"
5848,"<mark> That is a massive amount, and those are the people, with their families, who are paying hundreds of thousands and pounds</mark>"
5849,"<mark> First, minor and technical Government amendment 29 will update a reference in the Health and Social Care Community Health and Standards Act 2003 to reflect the changes made to section 99 of the National Health Service Act 2006</mark>"
5850,"<mark> Secondly, Government amendment 30 will designate integrated care boards as operators of essential services under the Network and Information Systems Regulations 2018</mark>"
5851,"<mark> Member for Thirsk and Malton Kevin Hollinrakethat everybody would be better off under new clause 49 than they are now Is it not the case, as illustrated by the Health Foundation, that people with very modest homes, worth less than £106,000, will never hit the cap and therefore will not be better off under the Governments proposed system than they are now</mark>"
5852,"<mark> We could spend all our time referring to what we said 10 years ago, and how the Health and Social Care Act 2012 has proved to be the disaster that we said it would be, but we will spare the Government the We told you so lectures, because even those on the Government Benches are now aware that the 2012 Act has been among the worst policy mistakes in the history of the NHS</mark>"
5853,"<mark> We were originally told that this was a Bill for integration, but halfway through its consideration, we were told there would be a White Paper along shortly to deal with integration</mark>"
5854,<mark> We have seen the NHS proposals for a provider selection regime to replace the regulations under section 75 of the 2012 Act</mark>
5855,"<mark> I gave the example earlier that in our region, 15% of people with dementia will reach the cap, whereas 34% would have under the Dilnot proposals</mark>"
5856,"<mark> I think that what we will end up with after this measure will be a whole lot better for people on low incomes than what we had, because the meanstest threshold will be raised from £23,000 to £100,000, and that is a very significant improvement</mark>"
5857,"<mark> As has been highlighted in the media and by Members in the Chamber, those with assets of about £100,000 will not see any real gain from this policy, while those sitting on assets of £500,000 or more will keep a lot of their wealth</mark>"
5858,<mark> That has been provided free in Scotland both within the care home and in home care since 2002</mark>
5859,"<mark> It was expanded in 2011 to provide more hours so that people with greater need could stay at home longer, and it was extended to those under 65 with care needs in April 2019</mark>"

5861,"<mark> of adults between 16 and 74 experience such abuse, and the Home Office has determined that the cost of that was £66 billion in 201617</mark>"

5863,<mark>3 billion was the cost to the health service</mark>
5864,"<mark> We know that 23% of those who are at risk attend AE, and yet nothing happens</mark>"

5866,"<mark> Does she agree that to find patients for studies, often tens of thousands of pounds is spent on radio and online adverts If her amendment 17 is successful, it could be revolutionary for research in this country</mark>"
5867,"<mark> That is why I have put forward amendment 58, which is designed to ensure that any organisation carrying out the functions of an ICB on its behalf is a statutory NHS body</mark>"
5868,<mark> Friend agree that the Bill has the sense of being an NHS corporate takeover Bill We have already seen £5 billion in contracts being awarded to private companies through the VIP lane</mark>
5869,"<mark> The purpose of the ICSs is to have a more preventive, more flexible and less siloed approach than we have under the current clinical commissioning groups, without removing the grit in the oyster that is the purchaserprovider split and without upsetting the 1948 settlement involving local authorities doing social care and having a national NHS</mark>"
5870,<mark>My amendments 1 and 2 primarily relate to selfcare</mark>
5871,"<mark> We know the numbers 100,000 vacancies in the NHS and more than 120,000 in social care; and 1</mark>"

5876,<mark> He can say that with some force because of the more than £5 billion extra being put forward by the Government to fund social care in a sustainable way for the future</mark>
5877,<mark> We now have more than 5</mark>
5878,<mark>7 million people on NHS waiting lists</mark>
5879,"<mark> After the Government won the 2010 election, around 500,000 to 750,000 people were on NHS waiting lists, and the number rose every year before the pandemic, so the waiting lists are the longterm effect of the Conservative policies of underfunding and privatisation</mark>"
5880,"<mark> Among people younger than 65, the covid19 mortality rate was almost four times higher for the 10% living in the mostdeprived areas than for those living in the leastdeprived areas</mark>"
5881,"<mark>I caught your eye half a minute ago, Madam Deputy Speaker, and you indicated to me with that look that I was next</mark>"
5882,"<mark> Over the next few years, we need to recruit 9,000 more mental health nurses to   look after our constituents and more than 800 new psychiatrists, and we need to give all organisations charged with delivering healthcare that nudge, that push, that call to arms that they need to make these important things happen</mark>"
5883,<mark> The billions squandered on test and trace should serve as a warning of what the Government could do to the whole of our NHS</mark>
5884,<mark> Such tendering to the private sector was made a requirement under section 75 of the coalition Governments Health and Social Care Act 2012</mark>
5885,"<mark> I will be voting against the whole Bill, but if the Government refuse to accept amendment 9 to make the NHS the default provider, that shows what the Government of the party that objected to the foundation of the NHS in the first place are really up to, despite all the warm words</mark>"
5886,"<mark> NHS England research indicates that the outcomes for most major conditions are significantly better than they were 10 years ago, and the NHS is seeing more patients and delivering more tests, treatments and operations than at any time in its 73year historymillions more than 10 years ago when the Conservatives returned to power</mark>"

5891,<mark> That funding will end wholly unpredictable care costs and include at least £500 million to support the adult social care workforce</mark>
5892,"<mark> It will be implemented using legislation already in place under the 2014 Care Act, which introduces the independent Dilnot Commissions social care charging reform</mark>"
5893,"<mark>Amendments made 31, page 222, leave out lines 9 to 11</mark>"
5894,"<mark> We are increasing the upper capital limit from £23,250 to £100,000, which will make masses of people with moderate assets eligible for some state support towards the cost of care earlier, and the lower capital limit will also increase, from £14,250 to £20,000</mark>"
5895,"<mark> Below that level, people will contribute only from their income, fully protecting their savings and assets below £20,000</mark>"
5896,"<mark> According to the Health Foundation, assuming care costs of about £500 a week, those with assets of £150,000 will take a year and a half longer to reach the cap than they would have under the Dilnot proposals, those with assets of £125,000 will take four and a half  years longer, and those with assets of under £106,000 will never reach the care cap</mark>"
5897,"<mark> Contrary to what the Minister has said, people with assets of £106,000 or less will not benefit from the proposal at all</mark>"

6135,"<mark> Let us be clear, however, that it also indirectly impacts the remaining 49% of the population</mark>"
6136,"<mark> Clause 1 seeks to exempt HRT from NHS prescription charges, which are set out in the National Health Service Charges for Drugs and Appliances Regulations 2015</mark>"

6144,"<mark> With 41% of medical schools offering no mandatory menopause training at all, thousands of GPs are qualifying and entering practice with no knowledge of how to diagnose menopause</mark>"
6145,"<mark> I am delighted, as one of the 49%, to be a sponsor of her Bill, not just because she would have beaten me up if I had not been, but because this is a genuinely needed and worthwhile Bill</mark>"

6147,"<mark> As hormone levels drop, women are at greater risk of developing a series of other conditionscardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, obesity, osteoarthritis, depression and dementiaand the cost of investigating and treating these as well as the other additional appointments is putting extra unnecessary pressure on our NHS</mark>"
6148,"<mark> Despite the two hormones being combined into one product, women are charged individually for the hormones, meaning that each prescription costs them £18</mark>"
6149,"<mark>70, and with 86% of women getting only three months supply each time, the costs begin to add up</mark>"
6150,<mark> She might be aware that last week Dr James Davies of Oxford University published research showing that the NHS currently spends half a billion pounds a year on unnecessary prescriptions of habitforming drugs</mark>
6151,"<mark> For the 13 million women in the UK who are currently either perimenopausal or menopausal, and for all those women who follow, we need a commitment that things are going to change</mark>"
6152,"<mark> For 51% of the population, I think we deserve better, so I encourage the Minister to look at that</mark>"

6155,"<mark> A few days later, I had a phone consultation and I got my first HRT prescription last weekironically, on the same day as the Backbench Business debate on World Menopause Awareness Monthbut I know that millions of other women are nowhere near as lucky</mark>"

6158,"<mark> We are the fastest growing group in the UK workforce, often at the peak of our experience, with all the skills and talent that that brings, but 80% of women say that the menopause has affected their working lives</mark>"
6159,"<mark> If a quarter of men in their 50s were considering quitting work or reducing their hours, you can bet your bottom dollar that it would be at the top of the workplace agenda and a solution would pretty quickly be found</mark>"
6160,"<mark> However, we have to make sure that GPs are aware that, after the first three months of a woman being on HRT, they can put us on an annual prescription, which would be £18</mark>"
6161,"<mark> If we could really ensure that GPs understood that, it would be a saving of about £200</mark>"
6162,"<mark> There needs to be a reappraisal of the training given to clinicians both prequalification and postqualification to ensure that this significant health issue, which affects millions of women to one degree or another, is given the priority it deserves</mark>"

6177,"<mark> Although 51% will go through the menopause, that is different from saying that 51% of the population will therefore need medical intervention and medical discussions around this</mark>"

6232,"<mark> Friend the Prime Minister, this Government will deliver around £12 billion a year in extra funding for our health and social care services over the next three years</mark>"
6233,"<mark> This is in addition to our historic 2018 settlement for the NHS, which will increase its budget by £33</mark>"
6234,<mark>9 billion a year by 202324</mark>
6235,<mark> Peerages have apparently been handed out to anyone who can meet the £3 million entrance charge and agree to a stint as Conservative party treasurer</mark>
6236,<mark> David Cameron and Lex Greensill were given the run of Whitehall to beg for access to hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers money</mark>
6237,"<mark> More than half a billion pounds in testing contracts was handed over to a company advised by a Conservative former Minister, without competition and behind closed doors, with a second contract dished out to Randox Laboratories after it had failed to deliver on the first</mark>"
6238,"<mark> One of the major problems being faced by GPs in my constituency of St Albans is that some people are refusing to wear masks because, The Prime Minister didnt have to when he went to a hospital, so could I ask the Minister how she intends to lead by example when half of her own colleagues are still refusing to wear masks on the Benches opposite</mark>"
6239,"<mark> The First Minister has said that, regardless of what happens with covid or the economy, she wants another independence referendum by the end of 2023</mark>"
6240,"<mark> Between 2007 and 2019, the rate of job creation in Scotland increased by about 5%</mark>"
6241,"<mark> Undoubtedly, the Prime Ministers actions have led to the saving of thousands upon thousands of lives</mark>"
6242,"<mark> Not only that, but we have provided vaccines to the rest of the world, leading the way at the G20 on vaccine donation, committing 100 million doses, including the entire Janssen UK supply and half of the UK OxfordAstraZeneca vaccines for countries in need</mark>"
6243,"<mark> Contrary to what SNP Members claim about the funding going to welloff areas, £4</mark>"
6244,<mark>5 million of that went to a town that they may only have heard of called Maltby</mark>
6245,"<mark> It is one of the most deprived parts of the countryin fact, it is in the lowest 5% for poverty in the entire country</mark>"
6246,"<mark> Government funding and the police precept will mean that, by 2022, police numbers in South Yorkshire will rise by 228Interruption</mark>"
6247,"<mark> Despite what SNP Members may be chunteringthere are not many of them, admittedlyby 2023, there will be more police than there were in 2010, so we are overdelivering</mark>"
6248,"<mark> In her time as First Minister, the number of people waiting more than 12 weeks for treatment increased by 427% for outpatients and 1,590% for inpatients</mark>"
6249,"<mark> It was the UK Government who supported 175,000 selfemployed workers in Scotland, with a total claim on the UK taxpayer of nearly £1</mark>"
6250,<mark>7 billion</mark>
6251,<mark> Fewer than 13% of Scots put it in their top three issues</mark>
6252,"<mark> We have committed ourselves to donating 100 million doses, and that is part of the G7 commitment to sharing 870 million by 2022</mark>"

6256,"<mark> I am interested in how they alighted on the sum of £41,567</mark>"
6257,"<mark> More than a year on from the 2020 presidential elections in Belarus, over 30,000 people have been detained, with widespread allegations of torture and illtreatment, and hundreds of civil society activists and human rights defenders being detained</mark>"

6267,"<mark> The UK Government have supported nearly 100,000 businesses in ScotlandSNP Members do not talk about the businesseswith over £4 billion in loans through the bounce back loan scheme and the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme</mark>"
6268,"<mark> The very good man who runs Excalibur Healthcare, in fact, helped to launch the Labour partys science manifesto in 2005, so she can now withdraw the allegations</mark>"
6269,"<mark> The Financial Times newspaper has had to battle to force the SNP Government to reveal the total cost of their guarantee to Sanjeev Guptas businesses, which appears to be to the tune of more than half a billion pounds</mark>"
6270,"<mark> They have been paying the price with the longest squeeze on living standards in this country since Napoleonic times, with rising fuel prices and no plan to tackle them, with life expectancy falling in many parts of our country and with 5</mark>"
6271,<mark>5 million people on NHS waiting lists</mark>
6272,"<mark> We have thousands relying on food banks, with wages pitifully low and the cost of living extremely high, yet we have a Prime Minister who oversees the consistent approach of raiding benefits, keeping wages low and increasing taxes for the working poor, yet rewarding big business and those of accumulated wealth while turning a blind eye to wealthy tax dodgers</mark>"
6273,<mark> My parents were so pleased to have been welcomed to Britain when they moved here in the 1970s</mark>
6274,"<mark> At the exact same time, Britain created a record number of billionaires</mark>"
6275,<mark> There are now 171 billionaires in this country</mark>
6276,"<mark> We are still in the middle of a public health crisis and inflation is now running at 5%, energy companies are failing, the cost of heating our homes is even higher and mortgage increases are likely</mark>"
6277,"<mark> Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber Ian Blackford, who has been very quiet about the £270,00 he has rinsed from outside earnings since he was elected to Westminster in 2015</mark>"
6278,"<mark> Of course, I would not expect the SNP to highlight the way in which this Government have supported thousands of businesses in Scotland, with more than £4 billion of loans through the bounce back loan scheme and the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme</mark>"
6279,"<mark> I do feel some sympathy for her, given the massed ranks of two colleagues with hertwo and half perhaps; I am not quite sure where Labour is with that</mark>"
6280,<mark> She will call on allies to contribute personnel to the NATO headquarters in Sarajevo and to support work to counter disinformation and strengthen defence reform</mark>
6281,"<mark> Thanks to the integrated rail plan, we will build three new highspeed rail lines, electrify or upgrade three existing main lines, improve local services, and integrate them properly with HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail, all bringing benefits to passengers 10 to 15 years sooner than under previous plans</mark>"
6282,"<mark> Again, let me remind Members where the money is going £4</mark>"
6283,"<mark>8 billion via the levellingup fund to help regenerate town centres and high streets, upgrade local transport, and invest in cultural and heritage assets; £2</mark>"
6284,<mark>4 billion for 101 towns deals investing in local economies</mark>
6285,"<mark> We have seen the attack on the Electoral Commission, the privatisation of Channel 4, the attempts to install Paul Dacre as chair of Ofcom, and the secret freedom of information clearing house</mark>"
6286,"<mark>7 million in badly needed support for people in north Ethiopia, which makes us the second largest donor to the humanitarian response</mark>"
6287,"<mark> On drug deaths failure, with 1,264 deaths in 2019</mark>"
6288,"<mark> That is 15 times worse than Germany, 35 times worse than France and threeandahalf times worse than the rest of the United Kingdom</mark>"
6289,"<mark> Maybe they should tell us where the missing £600,000 is and explain why senior members of their party stood down from its national executive committee earlier this year</mark>"
6290,"<mark> Maybe they should apologise to the people of Scotland for the state of their education system, which is failing thousands of Scottish children while they bang on about leaving the Union and rejoining the European Union</mark>"
6291,"<mark> Friend agree that for all this talk of the levellingup agenda, when it comes to Scotland it is clear that it is a scorched earth agenda Whether we are talking about carbon capture in his part of the country or the Valneva contract to deliver 100 million vaccines, which we need right now, this Prime Minister is not capable of doing the very basics and telling the truth</mark>"
6292,"<mark> Microfibre plastic pollution is one of the most pervasive and preventable forms of microplastic pollution, with 35% of total microplastics released into the environment being shed from clothing</mark>"
6293,"<mark> It is estimated that we are breathing in between 2,000 and 7,000 microplastics a dayjust think about it</mark>"
6294,"<mark> He only felt the need to admit his mistakes and apologise to his Back Benchers in the Tory 1922 committee, and it was only because they were muttering about mutiny</mark>"
6295,"<mark> Fifteen of the Tory partys main treasurers who happened to hand over £3 million to the party were somehow given life peerages in the House of Lords, as if by magic</mark>"
6296,<mark> Twentytwo of the Tory partys top financial backers all happen to have been given peerages since 2010</mark>
6297,"<mark> In total, this group has stuffed Tory party coffers with £54 million Interruption</mark>"
6298,"<mark> The Conservatives see it as a virtue that if someone gives multimillion pounds to the Conservative party, they end up in the House of Lords</mark>"
6299,<mark> He personally gave up to £4 million in donations to the Tory party and affiliates</mark>
6300,"<mark> Three days after Lord Cruddas was introduced to the House of Lords, what happened He handed £500,000 to Conservative central office</mark>"
6301,<mark> It is £3 million for a peerage in the House of Lords</mark>
6302,<mark> We received just short of 48% of the popular vote at that last election</mark>
6303,"<mark> But it has not been a very happy St Andrews Day for many of my constituents because, as we sit here debating this today, thousands of them remain without power, lights, heating or internet connectivity as a result of Storm Arwen</mark>"
6304,"<mark> If anybody has to buy an ermine robe with a £3 million backhander, I think that says it all</mark>"
6305,"<mark> That is before we get to the reality of the corruption and sleaze we have seen in the past few weeks and months, with the VIP lanes for Tory friends, families and donors, the Owen Paterson scandal and the fact that people with £3 million can get themselves a seat in the House of Lords</mark>"
6306,"<mark> Constituents have been emailing me since I came here in 2015, as they have been observing this place and its shenanigans</mark>"
6307,<mark> What a hard neck Conservative Members have they pockled half a day from our Opposition day so that they could discuss the wearing of face masks in England</mark>
6308,<mark> Why do they think their opinion poll rating has dropped by something up to eight percentage points It is not because the SNP is not debating education or health; it is because Conservative Members are mired in a sleaze and corruption scandal on the scale of those in the 1990s</mark>
6309,"<mark> I was looking for philanthropy, good causes and charities, but the only thing that unites themthe only one defining featureis this rare ability to be able to give £3 million to Tory coffers</mark>"
6310,"<mark>With the leave of the House, we will take motions 6 and 7 together</mark>"
6311,"<mark> 1186,</mark>"
6312,"<mark>That the draft Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008 Amendment to Schedule 3 England Order 2021, which was laid before this House on 1 November, be approved</mark>"
6313,"<mark>That this House authorises the Secretary of State to undertake to pay, and to pay by way of financial assistance under section 8 of the Industrial Development Act 1982, sums exceeding £30 million with an estimated total sum of £44 million, to be made available, through the extended Airport and Ground Operations Support Scheme announced in the Budget, to eligible commercial airports and ground operators to compensate for the continuing damage caused by Covid19 to the aviation sector, on the basis of business rates liabilities or Covid19 losses, whichever is lower, from October 2021  March 2022, subject to certain conditions and a cap of £4 million per eligible company</mark>"
6314,<mark>I rise today on behalf of the people of Rother Valley to put on the record our strong and unwavering support for the Prime Minister and the transformative work he is doing for our communities and areas like ours across the north and the midlands</mark>
6315,"<mark> Should we not also be looking at those who have dual nationalityRussian and UK, or Chinese and UKreassessing and making them choose a nationality Secondly, should we not be looking at everyone from China or from Russia who has a tier 1 visa and reassessing whether those should not be withdrawn</mark>"
6316,<mark> He spoke on Radio 4 this morning about the weakness of the sanctions regime put together on Monday</mark>
6317,"<mark> He will know that the Prime Minister mentioned that we had sent 2,000 antitank missiles to Ukraine</mark>"
6318,<mark> This and the Government cybersecurity strategy are supported by £2</mark>
6319,<mark>6 billion of taxpayers money over the next three years</mark>
6320,"<mark>The Government spend £2 billion every year on food for schools, hospitals, prisons and so on</mark>"
6321,"<mark> One of the issues is how we combine the Places for Growth programme with other parts of Government, not least the record investment in research and developmentincreased from £15 billion to £22 billionso that we take the best of our academic research in our universities, and get the startups and then the scaleups in places such as Huddersfield</mark>"
6322,"<mark> In 2020, the inward stock of foreign direct investment in the UK from Russia was £681 million, and the equivalent EU figure was £112 billion</mark>"
6323,"<mark> The truth is that the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty broke down because President Putin was breaking the rules and deploying SSC8 missiles, which were prohibited by that treaty</mark>"
6324,<mark> China will be spending something like $1</mark>
6325,<mark>5 trillion on infrastructure across this great border zone</mark>
6326,"<mark> The reality is that, by 2050, the economies of the new silk road will be worth two and a half times the value of the economies on the Atlantic seaboard</mark>"
6327,"<mark> But let me be clear our fight is with Putin and his cronies, with oligarchs who have become billionaires by having plundered Russias resources and hidden their obscene wealth in the west, and with those politicians close to the Kremlin who have encouraged and enabled this appalling attack on an independent sovereign state</mark>"
6328,"<mark> I welcome the Defence Secretarys recent announcements about the defensive weapons we have been supplying, including light antitank armour and defensive weapons systems, but there is plenty more we could be doing, and I look forward to the announcement that the Prime Minister will make at 5 oclock this evening</mark>"
6329,"<mark> We should, for example, examine the fact that Putin is one of the worlds richest men, with his wealth estimated at £200 billion, largely distributed about the world in dollars</mark>"
6330,"<mark> Member for Orkney and Shetland Mr Carmichael said that Putin has an arsenal of £650 billion, but that will soon run down if we take effective economic measures</mark>"
6331,"<mark> The Prime Minister was dead right to ring the President of Ukraine this morning at 4 oclock to keep that morale up, and we must keep doing that</mark>"
6332,"<mark> In 2021, the UK provided more than £27 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, the UN agency working with Palestinian refugees, including £4</mark>"
6333,<mark>9 million to its flash appeal after the Gaza conflict in May</mark>
6334,"<mark> UK aid to UNRWA is already helping the agency to provide education to more than 533,000 children a year and access to health services for 3</mark>"
6335,<mark>5 million Palestinian refugees</mark>
6336,"<mark> One of the issues is how we combine the Places for Growth programme with other parts of Government, not least the record investment in research and developmentincreased from £15 billion to £22 billionso that we take the best of our academic research in our universities, and get the startups and then the scaleups in places such as Huddersfield</mark>"
6337,"<mark> Russia has 1,543 helicopters; Ukraine has 112</mark>"
6338,"<mark> Russia has 12,400 tanks; Ukraine has 2,600</mark>"
6339,<mark> 9 lays out quite clearly that the Communist party seeks a dominant position of its socialism over western capitalism</mark>
6340,<mark> He knows that EU dependency on energy is worsening and he has built up tens of billions in reserves</mark>
6341,<mark> Spending 2% on defence is not acceptable</mark>
6342,"<mark> Our own analysis has been in the integrated review for a year and a half Global Britain in a Competitive Age clearly outlines Russia as the most acute direct threat, and China as a systemic competitor</mark>"
6343,"<mark> On behalf of the electors of Wycombe, who feel this issue most powerfully, I implore my right hon</mark>"
6344,"<mark> Nine out of 10 Palestinians live outside the security barrier, while some 85% of Israelis who have settled beyond the 1967 lines live within that security barrier, including Israeli Jews residing in East Jerusalem</mark>"
6345,"<mark> The Minister expressed his sympathy, but as Labour has pushed for time and again, will he now confirm that this group will be able to claim the compensation that is due, as he has hinted, and if so, when Secondly, a year on from the historical shortfall scheme closingI understand that over 2,500 have appliedonly 30% of claims have been processed</mark>"

6347,"<mark>Over a year ago, at the Public Accounts Committee, I discovered that there were 10,000 shipping containers filled with millions of items of personal protective equipment costing billions of pounds, and I am afraid of waste</mark>"
6348,"<mark> Overall, the World Health Organisation reports that 35% to 40% of patients who apply for permission to travel to Jerusalem are refused, delayed or get no response</mark>"
6349,"<mark> Between them, they were awarded £4</mark>"
6350,<mark>9 billion in PPE contracts</mark>
6351,<mark> One hundred and fifteen contracts were awarded to 51 suppliers identified through this route and the total value of those contracts was £3</mark>
6352,<mark>8 billion</mark>
6353,"<mark> Between May 2020 and March 2021, 50 suppliers had priority referrals for covid testing support and were awarded 128 contracts with a total value of £6 billion</mark>"
6354,"<mark> In 1959, hundreds of thousands of Tibetans banded together to revolt, in defiance of the Chinese invasion a decade earlier</mark>"
6355,"<mark> As he was talking, I was thinking about 1215, King John and his advisers and the necessity to curtail power</mark>"
6356,"<mark> We also have one of the most historical bilateral relationships with China, which predates the United States relationship and goes back to the Macartney mission in 1793 and touches on Lord Palmerston during the opium wars, which was a sombre time in that relationship</mark>"
6357,"<mark> We know it is right to bring in sanctionswe look forward to the 5 pm statement, when we will hear more from the Government on strengthening those sanctionsso there can be nowhere to hide economically from the ramifications of the decision to take a country to war</mark>"
6358,"<mark> Over the past year, the Israeli human rights organisation BTselem recorded 77 Palestinian deaths at the hands of Israeli forces in the west bank, with half those killed not being implicated in any attacks</mark>"

6363,"<mark> Of the 72 postmasters whose convictions have been overturned, more than 95% have applied so far for an interim compensation payment of up to £100,000, of which 63 offers have been accepted and paid</mark>"
6364,<mark> Offers have been made to over 40% of applicants and compensation has been paid to 764 postmasters who have applied to the historical shortfall scheme</mark>
6365,<mark> At least 95% of those cases should have been dealt with by the end of the year</mark>
6366,<mark> The Post Office says that it wants this to be 95% finished by the end of the year</mark>
6367,"<mark> I want to say 100% by the end of the year, and that is the kind of timescale I am working on</mark>"
6368,<mark> Friend for the work she does on behalf of Tracy Felstead and others</mark>
6369,"<mark> Tracys case is one that I often hold up as someone who was so young that she has spent more than half her life under this absolute shadow, explaining to her children now what happened all those years ago</mark>"
6370,"<mark> That is exactly why those who were convicted had the £100,000 interim compensation to ensure that they could go a little way towards restoring some of their losses and that, if they needed legal representation, they had those costs paid for</mark>"
6371,<mark> They did not realise that so many peoplehundreds across the countrywere suffering the same issue because of a faulty bit of software</mark>
6372,"<mark> Friends constituents have not applied for or received their interim compensation of up to £100,000, will he please let me know I will certainly look into it, because that is exactly why those payments are there as a stepping stone to the final sums</mark>"
6373,<mark> Tens of thousands are likely to die</mark>
6374,"<mark> I inform the House that we will look to start the windups at around about quarter to 3, with the next debate starting at around 10 past, so will Members please be conscious of the length of their speeches</mark>"
6375,"<mark> As much as anybody in the House of Commons, having been chairman of the allparty group on Russia and being married to someone who is halfRussian, I have sought to understand Russia and the mindset of its leaders</mark>"
6376,"<mark> When Putin says that Ukraine has always been part of Russia, in a sense he is right because, following the partitions of Poland in the 1770s and the 1790s, Ukraine was an integral part of Russia for nearly 200 years</mark>"
6377,"<mark> The Prime Minister will update the House at 5 pm, and of course that will not be the last occasion on which the House is updated on the situation in Ukraine</mark>"
6378,"<mark> She was wrongfully convicted of stealing £40,000 from the Post Office and served 12 months in jail in 2000</mark>"
6379,"<mark>The Government need to get on and reform those rules somewhat more quickly, do they not In answer to my written question about steel targets for  HS2, the Government told me that they were unable to set targets for British steel procurement because of World Trade Organisation rules, but that is not true, is it The US sets informal targets through the Buy American Act because the WTO allows it to do so</mark>"
6380,"<mark>Around 70% of all central Government contracts in 2021 went to suppliers in the south of England, with almost half going to companies in London</mark>"
6381,"<mark> Because of the way in which we have pursued our trade policy in the past decade or so, Putin has built up a reported reserve in the region of $640 billion, so it is clear that he will be able to withstand economic sanctions for some time, and we should not overestimate the opportunities that they bring</mark>"
6382,"<mark> What signals have we sentby we I mean western Europeanssince 2014 We allowed Germany to go ahead and negotiate the construction of Nord Stream 2, a project that was designed specifically to take Ukraine out of the equation and allow a continued supply of gas from Russia to Europe</mark>"
6383,"<mark>We now come to motion 4 on legal aid and advice, which I propose to put along with motion 5 on local government, and motions 6 and 7 on social security</mark>"
6384,"<mark> If the flow of refugees does get worse, and if we are talking about the potential for many millions of refugees, the UK clearly has to be prepared to respond</mark>"
6385,<mark> It was also very good to hear the former Leader of the Opposition earlier in the debate speaking on behalf of the socialists of Russia in support of the people there opposing Putin</mark>
6386,"<mark> I commend the Government on their commitment to humanitarian priorities, sending 1,000 troops to the borders of Ukraine</mark>"
6387,<mark> It was announced today that we have set up a new fund and are committing £20 million to it to match the donations made by the British people</mark>
6388,<mark> I end by commending the Government on their commitment to the Defence budget 2</mark>
6389,<mark>4% of GDP is a tremendous step</mark>
6390,"<mark> Chancellor Olaf Scholz has taken the brave decision to cancel Nord Stream 2, to increase German defence spending and to export military equipment</mark>"
6391,"<mark> The Ukrainians I met were dignified and resolute, in the face of hundreds of thousands of Russian troops standing at their gates</mark>"
6392,"<mark> We have called this debate for Parliament, on behalf of the public, to stand united in condemnation of President Putins invading of and killing people in a sovereign democratic country; for Parliament to stand united in support of heroic Ukrainian resistance; and for Parliament to stand united with western allies and other countries around the world in confronting Russias aggression</mark>"
6393,"<mark> Labours postwar Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, was the principal architect of NATO and, in particular, its article 5 commitment to collective defence</mark>"
6394,"<mark> We sent 2,000 of our antitank weapons before the invasion began</mark>"
6395,"<mark> As I have told the House already, we have trained 22,000 members of the Ukrainian armed forces under Operation Orbital since 2015 and we were among the first European nations to send defensive weapons to the country with an initial tranche of 2,000 antitank defensive missiles</mark>"
6396,<mark> That complements the hundreds of millions of pounds already committed to building Ukrainian resilience and providing vital medical supplies</mark>
6397,"<mark> Germany has increased its defence spending to more than 2% per cent of its GDP, and changed a decadeslong policy of not providing lethal aid</mark>"
6398,"<mark> Russias central bank has more than doubled its key interest rate to 20%, while Moscows stock market remains closed for the third consecutive day in a bid to avoid major slumps</mark>"
6399,"<mark> We are ramping up support for trade in priority industries, such as technology and green energy, to £3</mark>"
6400,"<mark>5 billion, including £1</mark>"
6401,<mark>7 billion to boost Ukraines naval capability</mark>
6402,<mark> The runway can be swept and cleared within half a day</mark>
6403,"<mark> There is nothing new about propaganda or information warfare, but technological advances and our increasing reliance on technology make it much easier, quicker and cheaper to customise messages ever more precisely, for ever more targeted audiences thousands of miles away</mark>"
6404,"<mark> Worryingly, some security experts argue that 62% of all web traffic is generated by bots</mark>"
6405,"<mark> Between 2009 and 2018, there was a 440% increase in cyberattacks across the world, of which 75% were allegedly from Russia</mark>"
6406,"<mark> The sanctions have been excellent, and I support 100% the support for refugees</mark>"
6407,"<mark> It was an honour to welcome the ambassador to Ukraine to the House earlier today and, on behalf of my Ynys Mn constituents, to give him and President Zelensky our support and respect</mark>"
6408,"<mark> On behalf of the Labour party, may I say that, to the extent that the Government are willing to step up and play that part alongside other European countries, they will, again, deservedly have Labours full backing</mark>"
6409,"<mark> Our permanent representative gave me the estimate that the amount we would have to pay is somewhere between 4 million a year and 9 million a year, depending on how this is calculated; it is a rounding error whichever way one calculates it</mark>"
6410,<mark>Of course I agree 100% with the tone of what my right hon</mark>
6411,"<mark> The Prime Minister said earlier that we had sanctioned hundreds of people in this country, but that simply is not true</mark>"
6412,<mark> Will she make that appeal on behalf of the House and urge people to support the Ukrainian refugees financially rather than by sending goods</mark>
6413,"<mark> We need a humanitarian exemption like that agreed through UN resolution 2615 2021 in December, which the US has also passed domestically, because currently humanitarian aid organisations are unable to negotiate with sanctioned entities</mark>"
6414,<mark> The principles of article 5 are sacrosanct</mark>
6415,"<mark> If Russia attacks or invades a NATO country, in line with our article 5 obligations, we must be ready for what comes next; we will be at war</mark>"
6416,<mark> I stand today to declare my support and that of the thousands of constituents who have contacted all hon</mark>
6417,"<mark> Moldova is a country of something short of 3 million people, yet it has already taken 90,000 refugees, which is proportionately the equivalent of the UK taking in 2 million people</mark>"
6418,"<mark> We will give our full support to the reform of Companies House, but that was first announced two and a half years ago and we still have only a White Paper, not legislation</mark>"
6419,"<mark>This excellent debate and, at the start of our proceedings, the outpouring of love and solidarity for the Ukrainian ambassador, who was present, with that long standing ovation that the Minister mentionedunprecedented in my 30 years as an MPclearly demonstrate in a graphic way the 100% support that this House of Commons has for the brave people of Ukraine</mark>"
6420,<mark> It is no wonder that so many thousands of Ukrainian men and women are rallying to the flag to ensure they do not lose it again</mark>
6421,<mark> We must work out how we can alleviate the humanitarian challenge and the sheer misery of the millions of people who find themselves living in cities that are under siege without risking escalation that could make this world war three</mark>
6422,"<mark> They say the war is actually being fought on behalf of the very wealthy, and they look for a different Russia, one of peace that is not at war with Ukraine</mark>"
6423,<mark>Putins inhumanity to man makes countless thousands mourn</mark>
6424,"<mark> I have said it once, I have said it twice and I will say it a third time Putins inhumanity to man makes countless thousands mourn</mark>"
6425,"<mark> That takes on a particular resonance in a country that in its past suffered, almost 100 years ago, a famine genocide organised by Stalin that killed many millions of Ukrainians and is still very much alive in the minds of Ukrainians to this day</mark>"
6426,<mark> It has displaced about 2 million Ukrainians in their own land</mark>
6427,"<mark> More than half a million residents have already left the country in a short time, and the UN estimates that the number could go up to 4 million, which would create the largest refugee crisis that Europe has witnessed in decades</mark>"
6428,"<mark>Amendments made 52, on page 32, line 36, leave out 2 and 3 and insert 2 to 3</mark>"
6429,<mark>1 The Sanctions and AntiMoney Laundering Act 2018 referred to in this Chapter as the 2018 Act is amended as follows</mark>
6430,<mark>I am pleased to see the amendments that would lower the threshold to 10%</mark>
6431,"<mark>Within 28 days of this Act being passed, the Secretary of State must publish and lay before Parliament a report on the funding of enforcement agencies in connection with the provisions of Part 2 of this Act</mark>"
6432,"<mark>Amendments made 60, on page 33, line 9, at beginning insert Chapter 1 of</mark>"
6433,"<mark>1 Any precommencement regulations which authorise an appropriate Minister to designate persons by name see section 11 of the 2018 Act have effect, and for the purposes of anything done on or after the day on which this Act is passed are deemed to have always had effect, as if the regulations contain the provision required to be included as a result of the amendments made by section Urgent designation of persons by name</mark>"
6434,"<mark> On this issue, we have supported Tell MAMA with just over £4 million between 2016 and 2022 to monitor and combat antiMuslim hatred</mark>"
6435,<mark> Over the past five years of the places of worship grant scheme we have awarded 241 grants worth approximately £5 million  to places of worship</mark>
6436,<mark> In November 2020 we awarded £1</mark>
6437,"<mark>8 million through the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Governments faith, race and hate crime grant scheme</mark>"
6438,<mark>On my own behalf and on behalf of my hon</mark>
6439,"<mark> Part 1, Registration of overseas entities, establishes a public register of beneficial owners of foreign entities that own or buy land in the UK</mark>"
6440,"<mark> From the start, the register needs a framework of rules that commands confidence and ensures the completeness and accuracy of information, so our amendments 5 and 6 to clause 7 would require that entries on the register be updated within 14 days of any trigger event, namely the change or removal of a beneficial owner</mark>"
6441,"<mark> The idea that such a fine would deter those who fail to comply is frankly ridiculous, so we support Government amendments 45 and 46, which directly replace ours and will raise the fine to at least £2,500 a day</mark>"
6442,"<mark> Labours amendments 15, 16 and 17 to schedules 3 and 4 would reduce the transitional period to 28 days, which in our view would provide enough time for overseas entities to get documents in order, while recognising the need to act urgently</mark>"
6443,"<mark> Under Labours amendments 9, 13 and 14, all foreignbought properties would fall within the Bills scope, regardless of when they were purchased</mark>"
6444,"<mark> We recognise that registering properties bought before 1999 in England and Wales or 2014 in Scotland may take more time, for reasons that the Minister has discussed, so our new clause 6 would allow an 18month transitional period for such properties, but it is important that we make sure that they are included in the scope of the Bill</mark>"
6445,"<mark> That is why Labour has tabled new clause 7, which would require that the Secretary of State lay draft legislation on Companies House reform within 28 days of this Act coming into force</mark>"
6446,<mark> Member for Glasgow Central Alison Thewliss in new clause 4 on some of the areas associated with Companies House reform and verification</mark>
6447,"<mark> The Government have accepted the principle of Labours new clause 8, which would require an annual update to be made to the  House on the use of UWOs, in their new clause 31</mark>"
6448,"<mark> However, money laundering prosecutions have dropped by 38% in the past five years and the NCAs budget has dropped by 4</mark>"
6449,<mark>2% in real terms since 2016</mark>
6450,"<mark> We support amendments 26, 27, 37 and 38, new clauses 2 and 9, and new clause 29, among others</mark>"
6451,"<mark> It might disclose individual named nominees, but it would not then disclose the people on whose behalf the nominees hold the property</mark>"
6452,"<mark> The logical way to do that is by introducing an amendment to introduce the same provisions we are introducing here into section 790C7 I am sorry, again, about the lengthof the Companies Act 2006</mark>"
6453,<mark>8 FTEThis information can be found in HM Treasurys Outcome Delivery Plan</mark>
6454,<mark> That is why new clause 2 is so very important</mark>
6455,<mark> Paragraph 3</mark>
6456,<mark>1</mark>
6457,"<mark>3 of the UK financial sanctions guidance in December 2020 says that the use of an asset, even when it is frozen, is not prohibited</mark>"
6458,"<mark> Clauses 1 to 6 provide an overview of the register, define an overseas entity and establish the register and registration process</mark>"
6459,<mark> Clauses 7 to 11 set out the duties for updating and removing entities from the register</mark>
6460,"<mark> Such powers underpinned the restraining, freezing or seizure of more than £979 millionworth of assets in 202021</mark>"
6461,"<mark> Amendment 3 would not have the effect that we believe is sought, but I can see the potential merit in such an amendment and assure the House that we will look further at the intent behind the proposal to see whether there is a workable alternative</mark>"
6462,"<mark> Member for Barking for tabling new clause 2, which seeks to place an obligation on the Secretary of State to provide additional reporting on the funding of enforcement agencies</mark>"
6463,<mark> The combination of this years spending review settlement and the private sector contributions through the levy will provide around £400 million of funding in respect of economic crime over the spending review period</mark>
6464,"<mark> Since 200607, just under £1</mark>"
6465,"<mark>2 billionworth of assets recovered under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 have been returned to law enforcement agencies, prosecutors and the courts to fund further assetrecovery capability or work that protects the public from harm</mark>"
6466,"<mark> I also support new clauses 7 and 2, which seek to beef up enforcement</mark>"
6467,<mark>8 fulltime equivalent staff</mark>
6468,"<mark> It is welcome that the Government have increased the penalties, but I still fear that we are talking about people for whom billions of pounds are the standard currency that they are dealing with</mark>"
6469,"<mark> For minor errors such as submitting a late return, there is usually a fixed penalty of a few hundred pounds, but if a tax return is intentionally wrong, or there has been a lack of reasonable care, HMRC levies penalties as a percentage of the tax dueup to 30% for carelessness and up to 70% for deliberate inaccuracy</mark>"
6470,"<mark> Two years ago, the anticorruption campaign group Global Witness looked at this and found that 4,000 of the people registered as a person of significant control were under the age of two, while one had not even been born yet</mark>"
6471,"<mark> At the opposite end of the spectrum, its researchers found that five individuals each controlled more than 6,000 companies</mark>"
6472,<mark> There are more than 4 million companies registered at Companies House</mark>
6473,"<mark> According to The New York Post, the former owner of Chelsea football club transferred £92 million of New York City property to his exwife, Dasha Zhukova, just before the 2018 round of sanctions was announced</mark>"
6474,"<mark> Maiyas real estate empire covers more than £50 millionworth of property in Moscow alone and includes at least three companies, including Katina, which owns prime oceanfront real estate in Croatia</mark>"
6475,"<mark>I rise to speak specifically to new clause 2, on the funding of enforcement agencies, but I wish to say a couple of things about the amendments in general</mark>"
6476,<mark> I am glad he is going to talk to us about amendment 3</mark>
6477,"<mark> Fraud is now the most common crime committed in the UK, with more than 5 million offences, but hardly any are prosecuted</mark>"
6478,"<mark>7% in 201617 to 67% in 202021, so we are pursuing fewer criminals and we are being less successful in getting convictions</mark>"
6479,"<mark> Just to be absolutely clear, that is equivalent to 0</mark>"
6480,"<mark>042% of GDP, and that is a generous estimate that I have put together</mark>"
6481,"<mark> Even though the most recent estimate that I have seen of the cost of economic crime is around £290 billion, which is well over 10% of GDP, the National Crime Agency has suffered a 4</mark>"
6482,<mark>2% cut in its core budget over the past five years</mark>
6483,"<mark> In contrast, I met a group of antifinancial crime executives working for the banks and they told me that the regulated financial services sector spendshold your breath£49</mark>"
6484,<mark>5 billion every year on financial crime compliance</mark>
6485,<mark> Our £852 million is just too small in comparison</mark>
6486,<mark>It always seems to me absurd that it costs £12 to establish a new company in Companies House</mark>
6487,"<mark> Obviously we want to make it easy for new businesses to enter the market, but £12 is absurd</mark>"
6488,"<mark> We know that that gets exploited in relation to shell companies, but does it also facilitate economic crime If we quadrupled that figure to £50, it would still not be a fortune, but we would then have a massive investment that we could put into our enforcement agencies without raising any further money through taxation</mark>"
6489,"<mark> The British bank was fined £842 million in America, but only £102 million here by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK</mark>"
6490,"<mark> Between 2016 and 2021, the law enforcement bodies brought £3</mark>"
6491,<mark>9 billion back into the UK coffers</mark>
6492,"<mark> If that money had been reinvested, which is one of the ideas for funding the enforcement agencies, it could have brought an extra three quarters of a billion pounds to be spent on enforcement by all those agencies</mark>"
6493,<mark> Our amendments 18 to 23 would lower the threshold for beneficial ownership from 25% to 10%</mark>
6494,<mark> New clauses 2 and 9 deal with that</mark>
6495,"<mark> There are nowhere near enough resources applied to economic crime it represents 40% of all crime, but 1% of the resources</mark>"
6496,"<mark> For example, last year I think the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, one of the bodies charged with enforcement, sanctioned two individuals or companies with collective fines of £85,000</mark>"
6497,"<mark> In the US, a similar body levied 87 fines totalling £1</mark>"
6498,"<mark>5 billion, because it is properly resourced</mark>"
6499,"<mark> Some 43% of all financial crimes are identified through whistleblowers, yet it is something we do not talk about</mark>"
6500,"<mark> Airbus paid $3 billion in fines internationally and £900 million to the UK Treasury, and all that money came as a result of a disclosure from whistleblowers</mark>"
6501,"<mark> So if you are thinking of blowing the whistle, will you do it My constituent, Ian Foxley, who was involved in the GPT Special Projects case that resulted in £28 million of financial sanctions at Southwark court last year, has been 11 years without a single penny</mark>"
6502,"<mark> That man was earning £200,000 a year</mark>"
6503,"<mark> The ASA issues enforcement notices to online retailers where parcel surcharging practices are raised, and it has achieved a compliance rate of over 95%</mark>"
6504,"<mark> Friend the Member for Moray described one of the 5%, where, because of the way it was phrased, the ASA let them get away with it</mark>"
6505,<mark> May I ask him specifically for an update on the £900 million that I have requested for South Yorkshire to match the shared prosperity fund commitments that the Government have rightly made to Cornwall</mark>
6506,<mark>I am delighted that the UK Government have recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Wrexham and Denbighshire councils in order to allow the first phase of the £13</mark>
6507,<mark>3 million levellingup projects in Clwyd South to progress</mark>
6508,<mark>1 The Secretary of State may by notice publish the name of a person being considered as a subject for sanctions</mark>
6509,"<mark>Amendments made 50, page 16, line 11, leave out £500 and onetenth and insert £2,500 and one half</mark>"
6510,"<mark>I rise to speak in support of new clauses 7 and 8, but I want to start by expressing my solidarity with the people of Ukraine, who face unimaginable heartbreak and horror, and particularly to black residents who have been subject to unacceptable levels of racism and brutality</mark>"
6511,"<mark> Since as early as 2016, the Government have been making empty promises for tighter regulations to prevent these illicit activities, but since then, £1</mark>"
6512,<mark>5 billionworth of property here has been bought by Russian oligarchs accused of corruption with links to the Kremlin</mark>
6513,<mark> Given the almost £2 million received in Russialinked donations by the Tory party since the current Prime Minister entered No</mark>
6514,"<mark>I rise to speak to the amendments in my name new clause 5 and, in particular, amendment 4, which is supported by the crossparty group that has been trying to get our ducks in a row</mark>"
6515,<mark> I heard what the Minister said about Economic Crime Bill 2</mark>
6516,"<mark> It sounds like the promise of the good sequel after the filmit is coming and it will be even bigger and better, with bigger stars than the first onebut we all know how sometimes part 2 can be a flop</mark>"
6517,<mark> I sincerely hope that part 2 will come sooner</mark>
6518,<mark> I wonder whether we might want to try to do that with part 2 and part 3 and get the sequels out as quickly as possible because each one will be pretty meaty and need time</mark>
6519,<mark> I hope that Economic Crime Bill 2 will have all the necessary powers to clamp down on that activity</mark>
6520,<mark> Many of them own companies that potentially employ thousands of people in this country</mark>
6521,"<mark> We have all seen the reckless assault on nuclear facilities and the apparent use of cluster bombs and indiscriminate weaponry in civilian areas, but we have also all seen the incredible bravery and patriotism of the Ukrainian people, with hundreds of thousands of volunteers from all walks of life picking up arms and fighting and dying for their country</mark>"
6522,"<mark> I understand why getting directly involved in this conflict could lead to much wider suffering and conflict, but because we are letting others fight and die on our behalf, it is incumbent on us to do everything else we possibly can to help them</mark>"
6523,"<mark> It was the Labour party that introduced the tier 1 visa, which seems to have been one of the ways in which this country has been exploited</mark>"
6524,<mark>  Representatives of Americas justice system suggest that billions of poundsworth of properties are hidden in New York limited liability companies</mark>
6525,"<mark> Whether it was behind closed doors, or in plain sight when they proceeded with the plans for Nord Stream 2, we know that ultimately that money and those projects date back to a corrupt, criminal regime that stole its funding from the Russian people</mark>"
6526,<mark> It is very important that this is included in part 2 of the Bill</mark>
6527,<mark>1 Section 11 of the 2018 Act designation of a person by name under a designation power is amended in accordance with subsections 2 to 6</mark>
6528,<mark>1 Section 12 of the 2018 Act designation by persons by description under a designation power is amended in accordance with subsections 2 to 9</mark>
6529,<mark> It is substantially the same as NC40 but refers in subsection 2 to Part 3 of the Sanctions and AntiMoney Laundering Act 2018 as well as to Part 1</mark>
6530,<mark> This new clause would therefore allow an appropriate Minister to make consequential amendments to Parts 1 and 3 of the 2018 Act and regulations made under Part 1 of that Act; and amendments to Parts 1 and 3 would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure whereas in NC40 only amendments to Part 1 would be subject to that procedure and amendments to Part 3 would be subject to negative resolution</mark>
6531,"<mark> What we should be looking for is provisions that match the rights acquired under article 1 of the first protocolnamely, rights to propertyand clearly, there need to be qualifications on that in circumstances such as these</mark>"
6532,<mark> Members new clauses 2 and 3</mark>
6533,"<mark> New clause 2 would bring long overdue scrutiny of that significant weakness, and renewed support for our enforcement agencies</mark>"
6534,"<mark> That is why we will also be supporting new clause 3, as well as amendment 41, tabled by my SNP colleagues, in order to curb the ability of shell companies and other indirect ownership instruments, as well as their paid  London enablers, to obfuscate ownership structures for their clients</mark>"
6535,"<mark> Those measures, along with new clauses 4 and 9, will tighten the massive loophole that prevents us from having a properly resourced, properly empowered and properly directed Companies House</mark>"
6536,<mark> The Government are doing something in this Bill to try to improve the equality of arms between Government lawyers and the multimillionpoundsayear lawyers on the other side</mark>
6537,"<mark> If nominees are directed by someone elsesay, the beneficial ownerthe person doing the directing is caught by condition 4 in paragraph 6 of schedule 2 and is therefore a registerable beneficial owner</mark>"
6538,"<mark> However, in my article in The Northern Scot this week explaining to my constituents that I was having this Adjournment debate, I said that hopefully we would get to it quicker than last Mondays, which started at 1</mark>"
6539,<mark> Amendment 4 is very simpleit would delete this now</mark>
6540,"<mark> We would have pressed new clause 4 to a vote, had it not been so similar in intention to the official Oppositions new clause 7</mark>"
6541,"<mark> The Hyde Group recently billed tenants £9,000 a year for waking watch, although, thankfully, it rescinded it</mark>"
6542,"<mark> Leaseholders from the Renaissance buildings may be liable for £500,000 of costs relating to external wall investigations and the building safety fund application</mark>"
6543,<mark> Multimillionpound car collections will be loaded into jets; anchors will be weighed on superyachts; priceless artworks will be squirrelled awayall to wend their way back to Russia or some other safe haven for these people</mark>
6544,"<mark> Similarly, we are committed to consulting Northern Ireland Ministers on regulations made under the similar mechanism for Northern Ireland in clause 324, 5 and 6</mark>"
6545,<mark> The levels were £2 million and £10 million</mark>
6546,"<mark> If someone had £10 million, they could get their permanent right to remain in the UK fasttracked, and they could end up with UK citizenship</mark>"
6547,"<mark> I refer to amendment 41, new clauses 4 and 21 to 23, and amendments 18 to 23  and 40</mark>"
6548,"<mark>The Governments rough sleeping snapshot recorded 2,440 people sleeping rough throughout the whole UK in the autumn</mark>"
6549,<mark>We have committed more than £800 million to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping in this year alone</mark>
6550,"<mark> That includes the investment of £202 million through the rough sleeping initiative fund, which provides 14,500 bed spaces and approximately 2,700 staff throughout the country</mark>"
6551,"<mark> We are also helping people to find longerterm accommodation, including through the £433 million rough sleeping accommodation programme, which we expect to provide 6,000 new homes before the end of this Parliament</mark>"
6552,"<mark> Given that the new build premium is continuing to rise, and given that UK house price index data suggest that average house prices in England have increased by 18% since the scheme was first consulted on, can the Minister tell us in how many local authority areas the discount on those homes has not already been entirely eroded</mark>"
6553,"<mark> We already have the First Homes scheme, which provides a 30% discount for local people, for whom those homes remain in perpetuity</mark>"
6554,"<mark> Homes Englands early delivery programme will provide a further 1,500 homes, but of course we will monitor these developments and do everything we can to help people get on to the property ladder</mark>"
6555,"<mark> The affordable homes programme that the Government have announced, with £11</mark>"
6556,"<mark>5 billionworth of investment, will help to secure that, so that we can try to deliver the 180,000 homes that that is expected to deliver</mark>"
6557,"<mark> May I clarify it The Minister agreed to look at our amendment 3, which addresses the question of whether this is an entity or an individual, and whether, if it is an entity, that entity can put forward a company provider and thus hide the identity of the owner of the property</mark>"
6558,"<mark> The SNPs new clause 4 would make Companies House an antimoney laundering supervisor, as it is strange that Companies House is not</mark>"
6559,"<mark> Of the thousands of Scottish limited partnerships that have registered no person of significant control, there has now been a single fine of £210</mark>"
6560,<mark> We know they have been used  to launder millions of pounds in dirty money created by illicit business activities</mark>
6561,<mark>3 million in donations not to the Putin cronies who gave it to them but to those who have been harmed by Putin and his regime</mark>
6562,"<mark> In the legislation, schedule 3 paragraph 6 requires the Land Registry to do that, and it can prohibit or restrict a transfer or a sale</mark>"
6563,"<mark> To put that into context, the same report says that 87% of adults in the United Kingdom buy online</mark>"
6564,<mark> That figure rose as high as 95% during the pandemic</mark>
6565,"<mark> That means that a big number of shoppers95% of 440,000 peopleare being punished not for what they want to buy, but because of where they want to buy from</mark>"
6566,"<mark> The Scottish Parliament Information Centres report says that the additional cost of delivery charges in commonly affected areas, compared with the rest of Scotland, is £45 million</mark>"
6567,"<mark> That is £45 million that someone has to pay because they live in Moray, Inverness or one of many areas north of Perthnot the cost of the products, but the cost to deliver them</mark>"
6568,"<mark> A Findhorn resident tried to order a battery for a strimmer and was told it would be £30 to deliver to the IV36 postcode, which was almost more than the cost of the battery itself</mark>"
6569,"<mark> Another constituent in Dyke was quoted £15 to order a tap for his motor home, even though free UK delivery was advertised</mark>"
6570,<mark> A constituent from Forres ordered goods worth £89 and the company was offering free delivery on orders over £40</mark>
6571,<mark> She put in her IV36 postcode and the delivery charge rose to £117</mark>
6572,"<mark> So from free delivery for purchases of over £40, for her purchase of £89 it then became £117</mark>"
6573,<mark> Normal delivery was going to be £9</mark>
6574,"<mark>95, but they entered their IV36 postcode and an additional £40 was added, taking the total delivery cost to £50</mark>"
6575,"<mark> Another constituent put in an order for some garden equipment and although free UK mainland delivery was advertised, they were asked to pay a surcharge of £24 for Scottish highlands</mark>"
6576,"<mark> Finally, a product was ordered by one of my constituents in Elgin and they were told that the delivery charge was going to be £149</mark>"
6577,<mark> So by travelling 10 miles within Moray one can go from a charge of almost £150 for delivery to having no charge at all</mark>
6578,"<mark> Another constituent in Elgin bought a bed for £435 and the order went through and was completed, but several days later she was contacted to say, Actually, we have looked at your address and there is going to be a £70 surcharge for delivery</mark>"
6579,"<mark> They believed that they were going to pay a certain amount, only then to get a phone call or an email to say, Actually, weve found out where you live, we think it is too far away and we are going to put on another £70</mark>"
6580,"<mark> The cost of the gardening tool was £40, but she was going to be charged £2,000 for delivery</mark>"
6581,"<mark> The delivery charge for a £40 product came in at £2,001,997</mark>"
6582,<mark>Scotland was promised £1</mark>
6583,"<mark>5 billion a year when the UK left the European Union, as part of a socalled Brexit bonanza</mark>"
6584,"<mark> In reality, only £172 million has been announced so far</mark>"

6637,"<mark> That money, which takes the annual defence budget to more than £47 billion for 202223 and our equipment plan to more than £238 billion over 10 years, enables us to modernise and improve the defence enterprise</mark>"

6641,<mark> We are also investing more than £2 billion over the next four years in the sixth generation future combat air system</mark>

6645,<mark>6 billion ringfenced for RD over the next four years</mark>

6649,"<mark> In 2010, a Conservative party came into power, in the coalition Government, that had argued before the election for more spending on everything in defence, but then, suddenly, they got into a programme of austerity, under the cloud of a mythical £38 billion black hole that the bad Labour Government had left them</mark>"
6650,"<mark> I welcome things like the national shipbuilding strategy, but I am appalled that, even this week, the MOD has given a £10 million contract to a Dutch yard for a vessel that could have been built here</mark>"
6651,"<mark> As a result, we need to look at absolute numbers in respect of what we need to invest in defence to achieve the things we want to achieve we must not be hung up on a particular percentageofGDP target, because that is going to be a moving feast and I think we will, unfortunately, be in a fairly major recession before too long</mark>"
6652,"<mark> In June 2021, the National Audit Office published a report entitled, Improving the Performance of Major Equipment Contracts, because it was picking up on a catalogue of failures, of late delivery, of equipment being delivered that was not fit for purpose, and of contracts going hundreds of millionssometimes billions of pounds over budget</mark>"
6653,"<mark> We identified, for example, that the contract for four Astuteclass attack submarines was more than £1 billion above budget and the Queen Elizabethclass aircraft carriers were £2</mark>"
6654,<mark>75 billion over budget</mark>
6655,"<mark> It is easy to look at those numbers in the context of the total MOD budget and say that none individually is a huge percentage, but when we think what £3 billion, £4 billion or £5 billion could do to improve the accommodation that service personnel are living in, for example, and what that would do for morale, that waste of public money is simply inexcusable</mark>"
6656,"<mark> I could talk until 7 oclock, if the right hon</mark>"
6657,"<mark>5 billion of additional funding to address the backlog in maintenance and repairs of that accommodation, which at the time was estimated to be about £1</mark>"
6658,<mark>5 billion</mark>
6659,"<mark> I think it is dishonest to state as a matter of fact that the equipment plan is affordable, because in order for it to be affordable, as the NAO report states in paragraph 2</mark>"
6660,"<mark>7, £3 billion of financial risk was not included</mark>"
6661,"<mark> For example, a future combat air system had an estimated cost in its business case up to 2031 of between £10 billion and £17 billion</mark>"
6662,<mark> The equipment plan allocates £8</mark>
6663,"<mark>65 billion, so that one project alone is, at best, underfunded by £1</mark>"
6664,"<mark>35 billion, and at worst it has possibly been allocated barely half the money it will cost</mark>"
6665,<mark>17 refers to £7 billion of what the MOD terms Planned Cost ReductionsI think this is what the right hon</mark>
6666,"<mark> At the time, according to that report, the toplevel budget holders had plans to deliver less than half of the £3</mark>"
6667,<mark>1 billion</mark>
6668,<mark> Some £2</mark>
6669,"<mark>6 billion of it needed to be achieved by 2025, within the first four years, and the first of those first four years is up in three weeks time</mark>"
6670,"<mark> It cannot afford to get it wrong this time, but I think we all know that the chances of it getting it right and delivering that £7 billion, if its past record is anything to go by, are very slight</mark>"
6671,"<mark> An independent assessment carried out by the MODs cost assurance and analysis service, looking at projects that make up about 58% of the current years planalthough clearly there will be bigger expenditure on some of them laterreckoned that those projects alone were likely to cost £7</mark>"
6672,<mark>6 billion more than was assumed in the makeup of the defence equipment plan</mark>
6673,<mark>5% budget increase every year up to 2031</mark>
6674,"<mark> It is costing billions and billions of pounds that the MOD simply cannot afford to waste, and there will be times when it risks costing the lives of our service personnel</mark>"
6675,<mark> The first is on the continual debate about percentage spending</mark>
6676,<mark> We should always remember that 2% is the minimum we are expected to spend on defence by NATO</mark>
6677,<mark> We now need to look very much at what that 2% is</mark>
6678,"<mark> What does the 2% mean when it comes to UK defence spending A 2016 report by the Defence Committee called Shifting the goalposts showed that now the 2% includes war pensions, contributions to United Nations peacekeeping, pensions for retired civilian MOD personnel and MOD income, among other things</mark>"
6679,"<mark> Fair enough, if that is to be included in defence spending, that is to be included in defence spending, but we should not for one minute assume that if we are saying we are spending 2% of GDP on defence, it is being spent on defence equipment or on personnel; it now covers a far bigger, wider range of things than it used to when we were calculating what we were contributing to the overall NATO budget</mark>"
6680,<mark> We must remember that people such as President Putin are the direct descendants of the regime whose ideology led them to kill millions of their own people in the decades in which Leninism and bolshevism held sway</mark>
6681,"<mark> It is a fact that, in the aftermath of the Korean war, defence spending as a proportion of GDP at one point was as high as 7%</mark>"
6682,"<mark> In about 1963, it crossed over with spending on welfare at 6%</mark>"
6683,"<mark> That was all a long time ago, but as recently as the 1980s the spending on health, education and defence was roughly the same at just over 4% of GDP</mark>"
6684,<mark>I do agree with that point; using GDP percentages has always been only a very rough and ready guide</mark>
6685,<mark>1% on the old method of calculation and 3</mark>
6686,"<mark>6% on the new method of calculation, whereby the MOD is allowed to include certain things we never used to include, it then became an argument as to whether we would even manage to achieve 2% of GDP</mark>"
6687,"<mark> Our expectations have been managed down so far that when, even in recent times, a number of us have called for 3% to be a target, it was regarded as being completely out of reach</mark>"
6688,"<mark> The sort of effort we put into defending this country is the most important investment we can make, so 3% of GDP should now be seen not as a target or as a minimum, but as a stepping stone on the way to a realistic investment to meet the threat that never really went away, the reality of which in Ukraine has now been proclaimed for all the world to see</mark>"
6689,"<mark> I found the IR quite frustrating, because the focus was on not making bad press announcements about the removal of regiments, although we have obviously heard the example of 2 Mercian</mark>"

6693,"<mark> May I make two requests from that First, it is reported that there are many thousands of unaccompanied Ukrainian children across the border, who have been taken there for safety, and that the number is growing</mark>"
6694,"<mark> We supplied them with 2,000 antitank missiles before the invasion, and I welcome what he said in his statement about what we are doing today</mark>"
6695,"<mark> The initial supply was to be 2,000 new light antitank weapons, small arms and ammunition</mark>"
6696,"<mark> I can update the House that, as of today, we have delivered 3,615 NLAWs and continue to deliver more</mark>"
6697,"<mark> To date, the international community has donated more than 900 manportable air defence missiles and thousands of antitank guided weapons of varying types, as well as various small arms</mark>"
6698,"<mark> Today the estimated number of Ukrainian civilians killed or injured stands at more than 1,000, but the true figure is expected to be much higher, and I am afraid that worse is likely to come</mark>"
6699,"<mark> It is for that reason that the UK will increase its funding for Ukraine to £220 million, which includes £120 million of humanitarian aid</mark>"
6700,"<mark> We have put over 1,000 more British troops on readiness to support humanitarian responses in the bordering countries</mark>"
6701,<mark>I agree 100% with my hon</mark>
6702,"<mark> If there is a message from the House, which seems to be in agreement, it is that we need to spend more on defenceup to 3%and to reverse the cuts, before it is too late, to the infantry</mark>"
6703,"<mark> In the light of Russias invasion, Germany has announced an increase in its defence spending, including a 100 billion fund to upgrade its armed forces</mark>"
6704,"<mark> I do not want the impression to be abroad that Private Stone, doubling forward by half section with his Carl Gustaf, made a huge contribution to the defence of the realm</mark>"
6705,"<mark> The only question is whether we end up at 3% quickly or slowly, because I think that that will be the direction of travel</mark>"
6706,<mark> There will be a great deal of support from Conservative Members for moving from 2%however the figures were added uptowards 3% or more</mark>
6707,"<mark> He has designated a oneoff sum of 100 billion to set up a special fund, and has pledged an annual 2% of GDP</mark>"
6708,"<mark> In the 12 months running up to 30 September 2021, the Royal Navy had an uplift in recruitment of 4</mark>"
6709,"<mark>3%, the Army had an uplift of 25</mark>"
6710,<mark>2% and the RAF had an uplift of 8</mark>
6711,<mark>2%</mark>
6712,"<mark> One of the things that came up when we were having the debate around foreign aid was whether we should look at certain reforms, and if we return to 0</mark>"
6713,"<mark>7%, I would really like us to look at ways in which some of that money could be spent through the Ministry of Defence to support our armed forces to undertake humanitarian missions</mark>"
6714,"<mark>In commending the Government for their robust response to this dreadful invasion and notwithstanding existing levels of support and our article 5 commitment to NATO, the Government are right to rule out a nofly zone and also to emphasise that it is a difficult balance to ensure that any defensive support is calibrated not to escalate matters to a strategic level</mark>"
6715,"<mark> Friend will agree that Poland is making a huge humanitarian effort, supporting hundreds of thousands of refugees and proposing military support</mark>"
6716,"<mark>In February this year we put a further £250 million into the Executive to allow them more flexibility, on top of their underspend, to support people at a time when there are such pressures</mark>"
6717,<mark>I am afraid that is the $60 million question</mark>
6718,"<mark> Does he agree that we are not going to deter further Russian adventurism with a £4 billion light tank that not only does not work, but deafens its own crew</mark>"
6719,"<mark> I challenged the Minister before Christmas as to whether his Department was going to give a £10 million contract to Damen in the Netherlands for a special naval vehicle, and he said we should wait for the competition</mark>"
6720,"<mark> Some 36% of those 80,000 people were living in accommodation rated grade 4 or below</mark>"
6721,"<mark> At a cost of about £150 million per aircraft, the fleet of 14 would have cost £2</mark>"
6722,"<mark>1 billion, comparable to the amount of money that the MOD has wasted on writeoffs since 2010</mark>"
6723,"<mark> Some examples that Labour has uncovered are simply embarrassing, such as £64 million wasted on admin errors</mark>"
6724,"<mark> and gallant Members how much they would like to see numbers in the Army go up, but they do not talk so much about the cost of the Defence Nuclear Organisation, which is 50% higher than that of the next department, the Army</mark>"

6726,<mark>There was a report from Reuters yesterday that dozens of former Paras have signed up for the Ukrainian foreign legion and that hundreds more are expected to do so</mark>
6727,"<mark> Will the Secretary of State say a little more about the 1,000 UK troops who I understand from his statement are still on standby to provide humanitarian assistance Where are they and under what circumstances will they be deployed</mark>"
6728,"<mark> Nevertheless, the commitment to article 5 is important</mark>"
6729,"<mark> Also, one way the Ukrainians are delivering close air supportor, actually,  fires in depthis through the Turkish TB2 unmanned aerial vehicles, which are delivering munitions to their artillery and, indeed, their supply lines, which are credibly important, in order to slow down or block the Russian advance</mark>"

6736,<mark>I am not sure I am in a position to give betting odds in terms of percentages</mark>
6737,"<mark> These are political decisions that have been taken, and nearly 30% of our procurement is now bought off the shelf from the United States, with no commitment from companies such as Boeing to reinvest to ensure that not only jobs but technology stay in the UK</mark>"
6738,"<mark> She is absolutely right to make the point that men are 99% of the problem, but we can be 50% of the solution</mark>"
6739,"<mark> We are ranked as the 45th country in the world for the proportion of women in Parliament, and only 36% of our councillors are women</mark>"
6740,"<mark> In a week when we heard the President of Ukraine quote Churchill, walking down Whitehall, seeing the statue, and remembering the contribution of 7 million women in world war two, has taken on a whole new significance, with so many inspiring women on the frontline in Ukraine</mark>"
6741,"<mark> The majority of the now millions of refugees fleeing Ukraine are women and children, and they need visafree access to the United Kingdom with their children</mark>"
6742,"<mark> Globally, an estimated 736 million women have experienced sexual violencethat is one in three of us</mark>"
6743,"<mark> Violence extends to children, too; 60 million girls are being sexually assaulted on their way to school every year</mark>"
6744,"<mark> Last year, less than 2% of rape cases ended in conviction, adding insult to injury for survivors who find the strength to come forward and report rapewhich only one in six women actually do, because they mistrust the system</mark>"
6745,"<mark> Although such a measure would not be a silver bullet, there are many reasons why it would mean progress it would allow for the more accurate collection of data on harassment and make the collection of such data mandatory; it would set a precedent that such behaviour is unacceptable; it would curb the street harassment that 68% of all women experience on a near daily basis;  and it would stamp out lowlevel behaviour based on misogyny so that it would not lead to much more serious offences based on misogyny</mark>"
6746,"<mark> This violence affects 51% of the populationwomen who work, women who vote, women watching as we fail to do anything at all to reduce these horrific statistics</mark>"

6772,"<mark> An independent poll of more than 1,100 women throughout the UK, commissioned by the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, shows that a clear majority want telemedicine for early medical abortion to remain</mark>"
6773,"<mark> Currently, the pig sector in the UK is still in crisis, with thousands of animals dammed back on farms and more than 40,000, sadly, having been culled on farms and not going into the food supply chain, creating huge health and welfare issues</mark>"

6780,"<mark> The Office for National Statistics has reported that since the start of, and at every point during, the pandemic, women reported significantly higher anxiety than men, with women being 1</mark>"
6781,<mark>3 times lonelier</mark>
6782,<mark> A report from the Institute for Public Policy Research from April 2021 shockingly reported a 62% increase in the number of women disclosing that they had experienced sexual violence in the first four months of the pandemic</mark>
6783,"<mark> In the northeast alone, there was a 179% increase in reports from women of abuse</mark>"

6786,"<mark> PhD computer and data scientists are powering the economy, creating new billiondollar   companies in life sciences, artificial intelligence, fintech, health tech and beyond</mark>"
6787,"<mark> Girls are only half as likely as boys to say that their strongest subject is science or maths, despite the fact that we know that they now regularly outperform boys in these subjects</mark>"
6788,<mark> A Girlguiding survey last year showed that over half of 11 to 21yearold girls and women said that they felt that STEM subjects were more for the boys</mark>
6789,"<mark>5% of engineers are women, and only 13% of STEM workers at management level are women</mark>"
6790,<mark> By tackling childcare we can perhaps unleash the productivity of half the population even further</mark>
6791,"<mark> That said, it means that only 34% of MPs are women, despite the 2011 census finding that 51% of the population are women</mark>"
6792,"<mark> We have made great progress in increasing the number of girls studying STEM subjects, but at present women make up only 24% of the STEM workforce</mark>"

6795,"<mark> The Government commissioned the Alison Rose review in 2019, which identified a £250 billion boost to the UK economy through breaking down barriers to female entrepreneurs</mark>"
6796,"<mark> However, we will not get very far if 99% of venture capital is passing femaleled firms by</mark>"
6797,<mark> That has increased by 50% in the past six yearsas it should</mark>
6798,"<mark> I am not going to be prescriptive about what yards and what procurements will be involved, as that would be wrong on all kinds of levels, but we have 150 vessels coming through over the next 30 years and £1</mark>"
6799,<mark>7 billion of procurement for MOD vessels by the end of this Parliament</mark>

6801,"<mark> I remind him that the cost of the national flagship, spread over four years, is about 0</mark>"
6802,"<mark>1% of the MODs overall budget, so this does not break the bank; it is a relatively small proportion of the overall budget</mark>"
6803,"<mark> Given our proud shipbuilding pedigree in Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, does he agree that this is great for the Union Moreover, noting that we are a proud seafaring member of the United Nations P5 and of NATO, does he agree that we are better off together</mark>"
6804,"<mark> Perhaps while he is there, he would like to explain why the Ministry of Defence has given a £10 million contract this week to a Dutch yard for a vessel that could have been built right here in Britain</mark>"
6805,"<mark> I am not going to plunge into coalI will leave that to my colleaguesbut I agree 100% that warships will be made in this country by British shipyards doing a great job, as they always have  done, in supporting the Royal Navy</mark>"
6806,"<mark> With the £206 million he has announced for the UK Shipping Office for Reducing Emissions, may I urge him to give as much regard to the cleaner fuels of the future as to the tech being developed on vessel</mark>"
6807,"<mark> The Ministers own Department, in the past few weeks, has awarded a £10 million contract to a Dutch yard, even though I warned him about that several months ago</mark>"
6808,"<mark>With your permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a statement on behalf of my colleague the Secretary of State for Defence and shipbuilding tsar, concerning the Governments refresh of the national shipbuilding strategy</mark>"
6809,"<mark> At the turn of the previous century, Britain built 60% of the worlds ships and, although we are no longer the worlds workshop, our shipbuilding industry remains a global leader in design and technology</mark>"
6810,<mark> It brings in billions to our economy and spreads wealth right across our country</mark>
6811,"<mark> It is worth reminding ourselves that even in the digital age, some 95% of UK trade by volume, and 90% by value, is carried by sea</mark>"
6812,"<mark> Not only do we have much greater crossWhitehall and industry cooperation, but we are doubling Ministry of Defence shipbuilding investment over the life of this Parliament to more than £1</mark>"
6813,<mark>7 billion a year</mark>
6814,"<mark> Drawing on the multitalented skills of the Government, industry and academia, and backed up by more than £5 billion of Government investment over the next three years, the plan creates the framework for our future UK maritime success</mark>"
6815,"<mark> We support jobs, skills and investment and will establish a new social value minimum of 20% for competitions for Royal Navy vessels</mark>"
6816,"<mark> Friend the Member for Pendle Andrew Stephenson has committed £206 million to develop a UK shipping office for reducing emissions, or SHORE, which will fund research into and development of zeroemission vessels and help to roll out the infrastructure that enables the UK to achieve its goal of becoming a world leader in sustainable maritime technologies</mark>"
6817,"<mark> In 2020, we exported £2</mark>"
6818,"<mark>2 billionworth of ships, boats and floating structures</mark>"
6819,<mark> We believe that we should be able to grow our exports by 45% by 2030</mark>
6820,"<mark> It is a vision of a supercharged sector with thousands of highly skilled workers; a vision to make this the country of choice for specialist commercial and naval vessels and systems, components and technologies; a vision that generates the increased investment to level up our nation; and a vision that will spark a British shipbuilding renaissance and inspire even more countries to seek out that madeinBritain stamp</mark>"
6821,"<mark> That is why we are establishing the UK Shipping Office for Reducing Emissions, with £206 million behind it</mark>"
6822,<mark> We can be very proud that we are putting more money into warships £1</mark>
6823,"<mark>7 billion will be the spend by the end of this Parliament, doubling our current commitment</mark>"
6824,"<mark> We have a programme of 150 vessels, £4 billion of support going into British shipbuilding over the next three years, and exciting opportunities that our industry can follow</mark>"
6825,<mark> He is right that £4 billion is a lot of money and we want it to go further by winning export orders</mark>
6826,"<mark> It is right to say that they will support thousands of jobs and design is incredibly important, as are many of the subsystems often used by overseas purchasers, even as they do a lot of work on the frigates themselves</mark>"
6827,"<mark> 83A7,</mark>"
6828,"<mark> Friend is not pressing his amendment to a vote, but the Government could still accept new clause 5 so that we could fix this situation and deal with it</mark>"
6829,<mark> Through the spending review and the record £2</mark>
6830,"<mark>6 billion of investment in special school places, that will be delivered</mark>"
6831,"<mark>The Saudi Arabian public investment fund is a significant investor, having invested billions in the UK and other western markets</mark>"
6832,<mark> New clause 1 would place a duty on the Secretary of State or Lord Chancellor to consult the devolved Administrations before making regulations under the Bill that contain provisions that could be made under the Bill by the devolved authorities themselves</mark>
6833,<mark> Amendment 1 seeks to amend the Government of Wales Act 2006 so that a Minister of the Crowns consent is not needed for Senedd Cymru to remove the Secretary of States and the Lord Chancellors ability to make regulations under the Bill that are within the Senedds legislative competence</mark>
6834,"<mark> There is no due process in the Saudi justice system, in which there is widespread use of torture, and 75% of executions are for nonlethal offences</mark>"
6835,<mark> They say that their actions two and half years ago were the right ones but there were too many safeguards preventing them from getting their way</mark>
6836,"<mark>Will the Minister confirm that, if we dismiss Lords amendment 1 today, the courts will not have a role in fixing the dates for elections, because, surely, that is matter for us, answerable to the electors</mark>"
6837,"<mark> Lords amendment 1 is, therefore, with the greatest possible respect, without merit</mark>"
6838,"<mark>A recent survey by the Disabled Childrens Partnership and Let Us Learn Too revealed that 60% of families with disabled children have sought mental health support because of the stresses of having to fight for basic services, while previous surveys have shown that nine in 10 disabled children are socially isolated</mark>"

6842,"<mark> This morning, the chief executive of the Welsh Refugee  Council said that the scheme is not a humanitarian response, particularly in comparison with other European countries that have accepted hundreds of thousands of people</mark>"
6843,"<mark> What plans and measures are in place to support families moving into longerterm housing Will the £350amonth scheme be considered for other refugees, which might be more culturally appropriate</mark>"
6844,"<mark> As was pointed out earlier, 4,000 visas have been granted and the numbers are due to surge this week</mark>"
6845,"<mark> The £350 is there for individuals, but charities and community groups will have a vital role to play in helping to marshal individual offers</mark>"
6846,"<mark> Ladys question, because I can update the House that, since the website went live less than an hour ago, 1,500 people have already registered through the scheme in order to provide support</mark>"
6847,"<mark> It is an ageold argument, and an issue that has launched a thousand dissertationsit was one of the major reasons for the 2011 Actbut it has become only more salient since then</mark>"
6848,<mark> It is important to recognise that the 1</mark>
6849,<mark>9 million devices that were provided by the Department during the course of the pandemic were on top of around 2</mark>
6850,"<mark>9 million devices already with schools, so the kit is out there to do this</mark>"
6851,"<mark> He has answered many of the questions that arose over the weekend, but may I press him specifically on when he expects phase 2 to start and what work is already going on with nongovernmental organisations Those organisations make the point that they have many people who have already been checked by the Disclosure and Barring Service, but the volunteers coming forward in my constituency tend not to have been</mark>"
6852,"<mark> Certainly the 1,700 of us who stood together in Winchester cathedral on Saturday with our prayers for Ukraine are very appreciative</mark>"
6853,"<mark> Secondly, as I mentioned, the Scottish Government have suggested that they could act as a supersponsor for 3,000, and we are working with them</mark>"
6854,"<mark>I also welcome this scheme, and my constituents have been contacting me about what they can do to provide such accommodation, but can I gently remind the Secretary of State that there are still thousands of women, activists, prosecutors, judges and others in Afghanistan who are still waiting to hear from the Afghan resettlement scheme Will this type of scheme include those people in a further rollout</mark>"

6859,"<mark>Can the Minister confirm that, from September, up to 3,000 new places are being created for children with special educational needs and disability through 35 new special free schools</mark>"
6860,"<mark> Throughout the review we have listened to hundreds of organisationsincluding the National Network of Parent Carer Forums, Let Us Learn Too and Special Needs Junglechildren and parents</mark>"

6862,"<mark> Wave 1 has already established 12 IOTs across 50 locations, and wave 2 will add a further nine IOTs</mark>"
6863,"<mark>I rise to speak to amendment 3, which stands in the name of my hon</mark>"
6864,"<mark> Amendment 3, which we will be pressing to a vote, would require the Secretary of State to ensure that there are representatives for each of the devolved nations on the centres board</mark>"
6865,"<mark> I will whip through each amendment in turn, starting with new clause 2</mark>"
6866,<mark> Member for Sefton Central is assured that we share the priority highlighted by new clause 4</mark>
6867,"<mark> As of this morning, only 4,000 have been issued</mark>"
6868,"<mark> Can he confirm that, if households are taking on a family or individual registered with a community support charitysuch as the Pickwell Foundation in North Devon, which has a proven track record of providing a warm, safe and sustainable welcome to refugeesthey will still receive the £350 a month</mark>"
6869,<mark> Friend on behalf of East Devon for the Homes for Ukraine scheme</mark>
6870,"<mark> Would he be able to use the £350 a month housing allowance to, say, come to a rental agreement with the local authority Would the Secretary of State reconsider allowing local authorities and community bodies to access that £350 a month so that we can provide as much help as possible for as many refugees as possible</mark>"
6871,"<mark> The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the Home Office have also been providing humanitarian support on the ground to Ukraines neighbours, helping them to cope with the displacement of hundreds of thousands of peoplebut more can, and must, be done</mark>"
6872,"<mark> In recognition of their generosity, the Government will provide a monthly payment of £350 to sponsors for each family whom they look after</mark>"
6873,"<mark> Indeed, Lord Harrington and I met them in order to ensure that we can expedite phase 2 as quickly as possible, and we will update the House in real time over the next few days</mark>"
6874,"<mark>The Secretary of State says he hopes that many people will be ready to open their home, but it seems that, due to Home Office guidance, none of the 3,000plus spare rooms offered to Afghan refugees by hosts across the UK has been used</mark>"
6875,"<mark>The Bill is much improved following its passage through the Lords and the scrutiny carried out in this House, not least by the addition of new clause 1, which was tabled by the Secretary of State on Report and addressed at least some of the concerns expressed about the devolution settlement</mark>"
6876,"<mark>I do not intend to detain the House for long, but it is a pleasure to rise to speak in support of Plaid Cymrus new clause 5, which would require the Secretary of State or the Lord Chancellor to obtain the consent of the devolved Governments when acting in areas of devolved competence</mark>"
6877,"<mark> On the face of it, that would be an improvement to the existing position, but it is still something of a halfway house that causes confusion</mark>"
6878,<mark> 1590</mark>
6879,"<mark>I beg to move, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 1</mark>"
6880,"<mark> We will be giving greater executive power to a Prime Minister who, in defiance of the security services, ennobled the son of a former KGB officer turned billionaire Russian oligarch, a Prime Minister whose career three weeks ago was hanging by a thread and who has been revealed to be up to his neck in dirty Russian money, and a Prime Minister who is currently under investigation by the Metropolitan police</mark>"
6881,"<mark>The UK Government have given the Saudi regime an estimated £20 billion in arms sales since the start of the war in Yemen, despite clear breaches of humanitarian law</mark>"
6882,<mark> Will he direct his officials to go even faster on phase 2 of the scheme so that we get this rolled out as quickly as possible</mark>
6883,"<mark>I will speak to new clauses 3 and 4 tabled in my name, then briefly come back to the Government amendment and to amendment 3</mark>"
6884,"<mark> Due to do the increased number of regulators in scope, the Government also had to publish an updated impact assessment, with the total cost to regulators increasing by almost £2 million</mark>"
6885,<mark> The provisions in clauses 3 and 4 will allow for the implementation of regulatortoregulator mutual recognition agreements and of the recognition arrangements in new international trade agreements</mark>
6886,"<mark> That is why I tabled new clause 4, which would oblige the Secretary of State to provide guidance to regulators on how to make the most of the provisions in the TCA</mark>"
6887,"<mark> I see from new clause 1, having read it a number of times, that it is consistent with what is in the internal market Act and I thank the Minister for listening to the concerns that we raised, even though the Government voted against our amendments in Committee</mark>"
6888,"<mark> Members on that, and I trust that the Government will still seek consent, in the spirit of new clause 1, when applying the regulations that are relevant to the devolved Administrations</mark>"

6939,"<mark>I do not intend to detain the House for long, but it is a pleasure to rise to speak in support of Plaid Cymrus new clause 5, which would require the Secretary of State or the Lord Chancellor to obtain the consent of the devolved Governments when acting in areas of devolved competence</mark>"
6940,"<mark> On the face of it, that would be an improvement to the existing position, but it is still something of a halfway house that causes confusion</mark>"
6941,<mark> 1590</mark>
6942,"<mark>I beg to move, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 1</mark>"
6943,"<mark> We will be giving greater executive power to a Prime Minister who, in defiance of the security services, ennobled the son of a former KGB officer turned billionaire Russian oligarch, a Prime Minister whose career three weeks ago was hanging by a thread and who has been revealed to be up to his neck in dirty Russian money, and a Prime Minister who is currently under investigation by the Metropolitan police</mark>"
6944,"<mark>The UK Government have given the Saudi regime an estimated £20 billion in arms sales since the start of the war in Yemen, despite clear breaches of humanitarian law</mark>"
6945,<mark> Will he direct his officials to go even faster on phase 2 of the scheme so that we get this rolled out as quickly as possible</mark>
6946,"<mark>I will speak to new clauses 3 and 4 tabled in my name, then briefly come back to the Government amendment and to amendment 3</mark>"
6947,"<mark> Due to do the increased number of regulators in scope, the Government also had to publish an updated impact assessment, with the total cost to regulators increasing by almost £2 million</mark>"
6948,<mark> The provisions in clauses 3 and 4 will allow for the implementation of regulatortoregulator mutual recognition agreements and of the recognition arrangements in new international trade agreements</mark>
6949,"<mark> That is why I tabled new clause 4, which would oblige the Secretary of State to provide guidance to regulators on how to make the most of the provisions in the TCA</mark>"
6950,"<mark> I see from new clause 1, having read it a number of times, that it is consistent with what is in the internal market Act and I thank the Minister for listening to the concerns that we raised, even though the Government voted against our amendments in Committee</mark>"
6951,"<mark> Members on that, and I trust that the Government will still seek consent, in the spirit of new clause 1, when applying the regulations that are relevant to the devolved Administrations</mark>"
6952,<mark> Member for Richmond Park Sarah Olney that we will be supporting amendment 3</mark>
6953,"<mark> Sir Bill Wiggin, on behalf of the Committee of Selection</mark>"
6954,"<mark> It promised young people 250,000 jobs and got barely half of that</mark>"
6955,<mark> Friend agree that the way to recovery for our economy and the cost of living is the multibillion pound plan for jobs that the Government are delivering</mark>
6956,"<mark> That is lower than the 250,000 jobs that the scheme could have funded, but the scheme was designed at a time when unemployment was expected to peak at 12%</mark>"
6957,"<mark> Friend the Chancellor, the economy has recovered better than expected and unemployment peaked at 5</mark>"
6958,<mark>2% in 2020</mark>
6959,"<mark> In total, the Department for Work and Pensions spend on labour market support will be more than £6 billion over the next three years</mark>"
6960,"<mark> The DWPs youth offer, which runs until 2025 and is worth £60 million, includes a 13week youth employment programme, supported youth hubs and, crucially, specialised youth employability coaches</mark>"
6961,"<mark> The National Farmers Union sees it as a particular problem and estimates that some 1,100 quad bikes are stolen from farms each year, costing farmers upwards of £3 million</mark>"
6962,"<mark> If just a fraction of those end up on public roads, that is hundreds of illegal quads running rampant on our streets</mark>"
6963,"<mark> There were over 10,000 reports of antisocial use of quads and bikes in West Yorkshire in 2021, a shocking 42% rise on the previous year</mark>"
6964,<mark> Just one antisocial quad rider ripping through a neighbourhood will disturb hundreds and hundreds of residents</mark>
6965,"<mark> That can take hundreds and hundreds of hours of police time, piecing together official reports from members of the public, scouring community intelligence on social media or reviewing CCTV from businesses such as petrol stations for that one frame showing the riders face, all to make a strong enough case to act</mark>"
6966,<mark> The Government will invest £3</mark>
6967,"<mark>8 billion in skills by 202425, which is equivalent to a cash increase of 42% compared with 201920</mark>"
6968,"<mark> On apprenticeships, I am happy to say that last year more than 3,000 people started apprenticeships in my hon</mark>"
6969,"<mark>With the leave of the House, we will take motions 3 to 5 together</mark>"
6970,"<mark>Businesses in the steel industry are more likely to be able to support the kickstart scheme if the Government manage to get Donald Trumps unfair tariffs of 25% on British steel exports lifted, as the Japanese and the EU have already achieved</mark>"
6971,"<mark> However, moving on, the Chancellor really listened when he moved to make sure that the taper rate was reduced to 55% in the autumn Budget; that is ongoing, and it recognises the principle of universal credit that people will be better off working than not working</mark>"
6972,"<mark> Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer is a multimillionaire who has no idea what it is like to get by on poverty, as many of my constituents and those on these Opposition Benches do, has she suggested that he should follow the Scottish Governments approach of uprating benefits by 6% with a fixed budget Is that something she is planning to ask him to do on Wednesday, or is it going to be more of the same from her Departmentno action</mark>"
6973,"<mark>Most benefits and the state pension will rise by just 3% in April, but inflation could be over 8%, so that is a realterms cut of 5% for people who are already having to choose between eating and heating</mark>"
6974,<mark>The Government are providing support worth over £21 billion across this financial year and the next to help families with the cost of living</mark>
6975,"<mark> Has the Secretary of State urged the Chancellor to reverse the £20 universal credit cut and rule it out to legacy claimants, or has she asked to replicate the Scottish Governments £20 per week child payment Where is her comprehensive plan to stop our constituents sufferingand by plan I do not mean more loans</mark>"
6976,"<mark> We will be filling half a million new jobs by the summer through our Way to Work campaign; that will help people progress, and I hope the hon</mark>"
6977,"<mark>We know we are at record levels of inwork poverty, with more than 8 million people in that category, so why are three out of four people who were in lowpaid work in 2010 still in lowpaid work now</mark>"
6978,"<mark> In fact, research by York University has found that securing  child maintenance payments would lift 60% of children living in singleparent households that currently are not receiving them out of poverty</mark>"
6979,<mark> 2</mark>
6980,<mark> That is partly because the message has gone out to all the many hundreds of thousands who might have been tempted that it is not worth trying</mark>
6981,"<mark>The windups will begin at 12 minutes past 4, as the Minister has kindly agreed to truncate his windup to get more time in</mark>"
6982,"<mark> At roughly 18 minutes past 4, we are expecting multiple Divisions</mark>"
6983,"<mark>I call Alison Thewliss, whom I must ask to sit down at 4</mark>"
6984,"<mark> Giving £54 million to the French to do something about this; making constant requests, which have been rebuffed, for meetings with the French Interior Minister and otherswhere have the Government not tried to engage constructively How would the hon</mark>"
6985,"<mark> Let us be clear that the UK has designated more than 1,000 individuals, entities and subsidiaries under the Russia sanctions regime since the invasion, including President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov</mark>"
6986,<mark> More than 3 million Russian companies are barred from raising money on UK capital markets</mark>
6987,<mark> What people are asking me is this what are we doing to get some money back from Fujitsu This will cost the taxpayer potentially hundreds of millions of pounds</mark>
6988,"<mark> To be clear, in the past week the Government have passed the Economic Crime Transparency and Enforcement Act 2022, established a register of beneficial ownership, and sanctioned more than 1,000 individuals and entities</mark>"
6989,"<mark> Evidence from programmes such as Justice and Cares victim navigator programme shows that when given wraparound support over a longer period more victims develop the confidence to engage with criminal investigations; 89% of Justice and Cares supported victims engaged with police at the last published evaluation, which compared with the national average of about a third</mark>"
6990,"<mark> That 48% were criminally exploited, so we must ensure that children who have been victims of county lines gangs have protection</mark>"
6991,"<mark> To demonstrate how difficult it still is to have your migration status resolved upon recognition of your exploitation, data obtained from the Home Office shows that in 201920 only 2%, or 17 out of 754, of child victims of modern slavery in the UK were granted discretionary leave to remain</mark>"
6992,"<mark> That would have a considerable impact, given that 91% of conclusive grounds decisions made in 2021  were positive, which means the Home Office deemed the individuals to be confirmed victims of modern slavery</mark>"
6993,"<mark> The most recent number of referrals to the NRM was 12,727, representing a 20% increase in referrals compared to the previous yearthe highest number of referrals since the NRM began</mark>"
6994,"<mark> I express on behalf of the whole House our sympathy with his family, friends and colleagues on this sad anniversary</mark>"
6995,"<mark> I especially support Lords amendment 4, which removes the licence given to the Home Secretary to deprive British people of their citizenship without informing them</mark>"
6996,"<mark> I also support Lords amendment 5, which seeks to ensure that the Bill does not violate the UKs shared international obligations under the refugee convention</mark>"
6997,"<mark> Lords amendment 6, which removes from the Bill the power given to the Home Secretary to treat people differently according to the way that they arrive and claim asylum, must also be adopted to prevent a twotier system that would limit protection for refugees due not to their need but to their method of travel</mark>"
6998,"<mark> Lords amendments 8 and 9 are steps in the right direction, yet they do not go far enough to prevent asylum seekers from being transferred to other countries and processed offshore</mark>"
6999,"<mark> I wholeheartedly support Lords amendment 54, which prohibits the use of new maritime powers contained in schedule 6 in ways that would endanger life at sea</mark>"
7000,"<mark>The events in Ukraine in the past month have shown how quickly millions of lives can be thrown into chaos by war and  violence, and how individuals can find themselves dependent on asylum or sanctuary afforded by other countries</mark>"
7001,"<mark> I also associate myself with Lords amendments 9, 52 and 53, which would remove from the Bill the Governments inhumane powers to make it easier to remove a person to a safe third country while their asylum claim is pending</mark>"
7002,"<mark>Does the Minister agree that amendment 6 is a huge slap in the face for all those people who play by the rules and engage in proper legal processes to get to this country, whether they are a refugee or not</mark>"
7003,"<mark> Many amendments were passed in the other place, but for the sake of time, I will focus on Lords amendments 4, 9, 10 and 13</mark>"
7004,<mark> Clause 9 is one of the most chilling parts of the Bill</mark>
7005,"<mark> Friend the Member for Aberavon Stephen Kinnock, and other Opposition Members, in Australia the offshore processing cost is estimated to be Aus $1 billion a year to deal with 300 migrants</mark>"
7006,"<mark> The truth is that even once claims have been processed and around 40% have been found not to be valid, people rarely leave because of a combination of irresponsible activists, fatcat lawyers and the Human Rights Act, which needs to be ditched as soon as possible</mark>"
7007,"<mark> Let us remember that 89% of Iranian asylum seekers  have their claims granted, 97% of Eritreans, and 96% of Sudanese, none of whom have a legal route</mark>"
7008,"<mark> Lord Kirkhopes amendment 9 strips out the Governments plans to create an offshore asylumprocessing system, and I believe he is right</mark>"
7009,<mark> Australia ended up spending over £1 million per person detained offshorearound £4</mark>
7010,"<mark>3 billion for 3,127 asylum seekers</mark>"
7011,<mark> Members that there are 84 million refugees globally</mark>
7012,"<mark> Millions have been displaced because of conflict and persecution and are seeking safe passage, including Syrian Kurds, Afghans and Yemenis, who have suffered the worlds worst humanitarian crisis 20 million are in need of humanitarian aid</mark>"
7013,"<mark> However, the Home Office data confirms that 87% of those arriving by small boats in 2021 comprised nationals from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen, for whom there is currently no alternative legal and safe route by which they can apply to get to the UK, so it is pointless the Minister saying that he believes in accessible routes</mark>"
7014,<mark>It seems that amendment 7 goes to the heart of what we are talking about today</mark>
7015,"<mark> That is why I rise today to support amendments 4 to 9, especially amendment 6</mark>"
7016,"<mark> There is no such thing as an illegal refugee in international law, yet that is exactly what the new group 2 category attempts to establish</mark>"
7017,"<mark> However, the Government are scrapping humanitarian protection as we know it and aligning it instead with the new group 2 status, meaning regular visa reviews every two and a half years compared with every five, no recourse to public funds, no right to work, restricted family visa rights and no route to indefinite leave to remain</mark>"
7018,<mark> Clause 11 is out of tune with the hundreds of thousands of people who have come forward to help Ukrainian refugees</mark>
7019,"<mark> Gentleman reflect for a moment on the fact that there are 1 million refugees in Bangladesh, many hundreds of thousands in Uganda and over 1 million in Poland Many countries around the world, which are very poor and have very little infrastructure, have taken in far more refugees than any European country</mark>"
7020,"<mark> Members that we will continue to uphold our international obligations and ensure that any removal is compliant with our obligations under the refugee convention and article 3 of the European convention on human rights, which protects against torture and inhuman and degrading treatment</mark>"
7021,"<mark> There were 1,131 refugees resettled in the UK through that scheme in the year ending December 2021</mark>"
7022,"<mark> We have granted over 40,000 refugee family reunion visas since 2015, of which more than half were granted to children</mark>"
7023,"<mark> In 2021, there were 6,134 family reunion visas issued, which was an increase of 28% on the previous year</mark>"
7024,"<mark> Again, more than half were issued to children</mark>"
7025,"<mark> Through that route, we have relocated more than 7,000 locally employed staff and their family members since April 2021, in addition to 1,400 former staff and families who were relocated under the previous ex gratia scheme for Afghan interpreters</mark>"
7026,"<mark> Even with a cap on the number of individuals, we can expect many thousands of applications, which UK caseworkers would need to assess individually to determine whether each individual belongs to the specific group found to be at risk</mark>"
7027,"<mark> During its reign of terror, Daesh raped, murdered or sold into sexual slavery thousands of women, and sent young boys to its terrorist training camps</mark>"
7028,"<mark> Let us not forget that 70% of the individuals who are currently making that channel crossing are men, predominantly single men in their 20s and 30s</mark>"
7029,"<mark> The number of desperate asylum seekers risking their lives by crossing the channel on small boats has increased from 299 in 2018 to an eyewatering 28,526 in 2021, of whom more than 3,000 were children</mark>"
7030,"<mark> Gentleman is referring to offshoring, but as we have seen, offshoring does not work it is costing millions and millions in Australia and every expert is panning the idea</mark>"
7031,"<mark> We therefore support Lords amendment 54, which adds language to schedule 6, stating that these enforcement powers must never put lives at risk</mark>"
7032,"<mark> We therefore support Lords amendment 5, which would add a new clause stating that nothing in the Bill must authorise policies which do not comply with the refugee convention</mark>"
7033,<mark> We currently have thousands of Afghan refugees stuck in hotels</mark>
7034,"<mark> The Lords amendment would also prevent asylum seekers from being forced into the dangerous net of the blackmarket economy just to survive, which is so often more attractive to them than relying on £38 per week from the Government</mark>"
7035,"<mark> We are pleased to see that more than 66 Conservative parliamentarians, including 27 members of this House, have signed a letter to the Home Secretary expressing support for Lords amendment 7, and we encourage Ministers to see the light and follow suit</mark>"
7036,"<mark> Of the 8,593 notices of intent to deem people inadmissible that were issued in 2021, incredibly, only 64 were upheld</mark>"
7037,"<mark> This policy simply increases the enormous backlog further and is a complete waste of money, so we support Lords amendment 8</mark>"
7038,"<mark> The latest ludicrous suggestion is that Ascension Island, 4,500 miles away in the South Atlantic, should be used for the purpose</mark>"
7039,"<mark> This is why the Labour Party supports Lords amendment 9, which removes offshoring from the Bill</mark>"
7040,"<mark> It is still too vague, and we will be pushing Lords amendment 4 to a vote</mark>"
7041,"<mark> The Government know it as well, which is why they cannot even accept Lords amendment 5, a simple amendment that would require powers in part 2 to be exercised in accordance with the refugee convention</mark>"
7042,"<mark> So Lords amendment 6, which deletes clause 11, must be left in place</mark>"
7043,"<mark> So we support Lords amendments 9, 52 and 53</mark>"
7044,"<mark> If that is not enough, perhaps Members should consider the billions of pounds such a system will cost, while achieving nothing</mark>"
7045,"<mark> As I have said a million times in the House, once that funding is in place the hon</mark>"
7046,"<mark> Offshoring is going to cost billions of pounds, there is no sensible argument in favour of it and we need to get rid of it as soon as we can</mark>"
7047,<mark> Lords amendment 7 is a simple but powerful example</mark>
7048,<mark> We therefore pay tribute to all the campaigners behind Lords amendment 7</mark>
7049,"<mark> Unless that can be fixed, we continue to believe that Lords amendment 4 is the best solution</mark>"
7050,<mark>1 Proceedings on consideration of Lords Amendments shall so far as not previously concluded be brought to a conclusion six hours after their commencement</mark>
7051,<mark>3 Any further Message from the Lords may be considered forthwith without any Question being put</mark>
7052,"<mark> Can he outline what that means in practice Is it just reimbursing the legal costs, or will we have a more sophisticated scheme Certainly, my constituent Tom Brown, who paid back £84,000 that he did not need to pay, is £84,000 out of pocket</mark>"
7053,<mark> Friend for all the work that she has done on behalf of her constituent Tracy Felstead and the 554 other postmasters</mark>
7054,"<mark> On where we are with the compensation, I can announce that as of 11 March, 45% of people in the historical shortfall scheme had already received offers</mark>"
7055,"<mark> That amounts to 1,067 individuals</mark>"
7056,<mark> The Post Office reports that it is firmly on track to make 95% of initial offers by the end of the year</mark>
7057,"<mark>That is the last question, so I will say that although the last three quarters of an hour have been my moment in the sun, it is not about me it is about the 555</mark>"
7058,"<mark> They begged and borrowed £70,000 from friends and families to fill a shortfall that they could not understand, but which we now knowand the Post Office probably knew at the timewas not a shortfall at all</mark>"
7059,<mark> 1684</mark>
7060,"<mark> Indeed, a YouGov poll showed that 81% of people who were asked agreed with the principle of allowing asylum seekers the right to work</mark>"
7061,"<mark> Member for Hayes and Harlington John McDonnell mentioned a figure of £200 million, and the potential revenue is certainly in the hundreds of millions</mark>"
7062,"<mark> When we put on the other side of the balance the fact that asylum accommodation costs £350 million a year, we can start to see why the numbers add up</mark>"
7063,"<mark> There are 324,963 signatures to a petition about clause 9, and I pay tribute to all those who have campaigned on it</mark>"
7064,<mark> We will be voting for Lords amendment 4 today</mark>
7065,"<mark> In my constituency, I have two detention centres, which house nearly 1,000 people</mark>"
7066,"<mark> There are 1,700 asylum seekers in hotels in my constituency as well</mark>"
7067,<mark> They are told to live off £5</mark>
7068,"<mark> All Lords amendment 7 said was, Just allow these people to workallow them to support themselves and their families, and to give something back to this country</mark>"
7069,<mark> At least £200 million would be put into our economy</mark>
7070,"<mark> There is an argument that allowing employment will somehow add to the pull factor, but having to live off £5</mark>"
7071,<mark>40 a day is not the sort of pull factor that will attract millions to this country</mark>
7072,<mark> That is why Lords amendment 7 needs to be looked at more rationally</mark>
7073,"<mark> Members to contemplate that, to look at Lords amendment 7, and to think again</mark>"
7074,"<mark> In 2019, 2</mark>"
7075,<mark>245 million visitors came to the island of Ireland and spent £589 million</mark>
7076,<mark> There has been a 90% increase in the number of visitors to the island of Ireland from North America and 60% of all visitors to the island spend nights in both the Republic and the north of Ireland</mark>
7077,"<mark> There are tens of thousands of movements each day on the island of Ireland involving Northern Ireland citizensfor the purposes of work or education, for example, and because people living in one part of the island may have business in the other jurisdiction</mark>"
7078,"<mark> The quickest route from Dublin to Donegal is through Northern Ireland on the A5, and even someone making a very localised journey from Clones or Cavan town, for example, will cross the border four times in the course of that short journey</mark>"
7079,<mark> This contrasts with the hundreds of children who have been put in hotels and forced to share rooms and even beds with adult men they do not know</mark>
7080,"<mark> Last year, 43% of victims referred to the national referral mechanism were children, with 31% of them being British, and the rise in county lines gangs is believed to be one of the biggest drivers of the rise in child referrals</mark>"
7081,"<mark> If the Minister is not minded to strike part 5 from the Bill and work with the sector and us on genuine alternatives, he must protect children from the worst of the changes, which only put barriers between victims and the support and justice they need and deserve</mark>"
7082,"<mark> In fact, in Committee during our discussions on part 5 alone the Minister referred to the statutory guidance a staggering 51 times when it is still to be published, which I must say made a mockery of parliamentary scrutiny</mark>"
7083,"<mark> Given that 48% of victims of modern slavery in the UK last year were criminally exploited, that suggests that clause 62 has the potential to exclude almost half of all victims from support</mark>"
7084,"<mark> 83F, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 1</mark>"
7085,"<mark>Recently, I was sent hundreds of Valentine cards from pupils at St Dunstans Primary School in my constituency, to my surprise; it is more than I have ever received</mark>"
7086,"<mark> The situation in Ukraine is driving millions from their homes, many of whom have found refuge in neighbouring countries</mark>"
7087,"<mark> Clause 11, concerning illegal entry into the UK, will criminalise those who do not arrive by regular routes, which for millions of refugees are simply not available</mark>"
7088,<mark> Will he publish an economic impact assessment on how many billions of pounds this will cost the taxpayer It has been promised for months</mark>
7089,"<mark>With the leave of the House, we will take motions 4, 5 and 6 together</mark>"
7090,"<mark> 83A7,</mark>"
7091,"<mark>Motion made, and Question put, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 5</mark>"
7092,"<mark>Motion made, and Question put, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 9</mark>"
7093,"<mark> Ladys record of Conservative interventions that are somewhat supportive, is not what she has just said about that 48% the answer to the question I posed to my hon</mark>"
7094,"<mark> Friend the Minister Under the Bill as presented, the Home Office will be required to intervene in half the cases to make the very difficult judgment whether to exclude or not exclude</mark>"
7095,"<mark> I think I have less than a minute and a half, so I will be brief</mark>"
7096,"<mark>Motion made, and Question put, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 4</mark>"
7097,"<mark>I rise to thank the Government sincerely for amendment 1, the Chagos nationality amendment</mark>"
7098,"<mark> They have suffered an injustice of approximately half a century and the Government today have gone a significant way towards ensuring that those people who are descendants of British subjects rightly have the ability to apply for British overseas territories citizenship, and therefore ultimately British citizenship if they so wish</mark>"
7099,"<mark>I beg to move, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 1</mark>"
7100,"<mark>Mr Speaker, may I begin by joining in, on behalf of the Home Office, your tribute to PC Keith Palmer, who lost his life five years ago today All of us who were in the House will never forget that day</mark>"
7101,"<mark> 83F, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 1</mark>"
7102,"<mark> The Home Office confirms that 87% of the 28,000 arriving illicitly in 2021 came from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen, for whom there is currently no alternative legal and safe route to which they can apply to get to the United Kingdom</mark>"
7103,"<mark> Much more sensible is to recruit and train several hundred new civil servants to process these claims more rapidly and, yes, to crack down on an overlengthy appeals process exploited through unscrupulous lawyers</mark>"
7104,"<mark>The east midlands freeport will see nearly £9 billion of new investment, and tens of thousands of new jobs created in our region</mark>"
7105,<mark> That is looking across England and Wales and will provide a crucial evidence base for part 2 of the Angiolini inquiry and inform any broader policy or legislative changes that might be required</mark>
7106,"<mark> As someone who over the years has worked alongside the Met and seen at first hand the incredible things that they are capable of achieving, I know there are thousands of officers, staff and volunteers across the organisation who perform their duties with skill, professionalism and pride every day</mark>"
7107,<mark> Lady raised in the first half of her remarks will be addressed by Her Majestys inspectorate as it looks at vetting procedures across the whole country</mark>
7108,"<mark> As someone who, like me, has an intimate knowledge of policing, I am sure he will acknowledge that there will be thousands of police officers up and down the land who are as disappointed and distressed by the revelations today as we are</mark>"
7109,"<mark> They, and millions of Londoners, deserve leadership in the Met that they can trust and have confidence in, not leaders who have indifference to the risks of corruption</mark>"
7110,"<mark>A freeport in Wales, especially in Anglesey, sounds like a great idea, just like in Teesside, where the UKs largest and first postBrexit freeport has already led to the announcement of thousands of future jobs in new green technologies</mark>"
7111,<mark>2 Any further Message from the Lords may be considered forthwith without any Question being put</mark>
7112,<mark>1 Proceedings on consideration of Lords Amendments shall so far as not previously concluded be brought to a conclusion one hour after their commencement</mark>
7113,<mark>I thank the Minister on behalf of residents for his answer and for the UK Governments interest</mark>
7114,"<mark>The UK Government are committed to supporting the development of the floating offshore  wind industry in Wales, with £160 million of funding available for floating offshore wind ports and factories across the UK</mark>"
7115,"<mark> Friend says, Channel 5 is 25 years old this month</mark>"
7116,"<mark> Friend join me in celebrating Channel 5s team who had the imagination and confidence to do that then, and the current team who continue to bring understandable, relevant, and relatable news to people in all parts of the UK today</mark>"
7117,<mark>The A2</mark>
7118,"<mark> Lady slightly, I believe the threshold will still rise by £300 in April, as was the Governments original plan</mark>"
7119,"<mark>I beg to move amendment 1, page 1, line 8, leave out July and insert April</mark>"
7120,"<mark> Friends powerful representations on behalf of Blackpool, particularly with the levellingup agenda in mind</mark>"
7121,"<mark> In its wisdom, it intends to split the A2 and M2 into two separate twolane highways midway between the A227 and Marling Cross</mark>"
7122,"<mark> The outer two lanes will be for M2 traffic going down deeper into Kent; the inner two lanes will be for the A2 to Strood and the lower Thames crossing, and the Hoo peninsula</mark>"
7123,"<mark> Not only will it cause dangerous weaving and accidents while the traffic tries to get into the correct lane, but the A2 will be narrowed to two lanes, which is completely inadequate for traffic heading towards the M2 at peak periods</mark>"
7124,"<mark> In 2009, Highways England actually widened the A2 at  this point from three lanes to four lanes to cope with increased volumes, and now the proposal is to narrow it to two lanes</mark>"
7125,<mark> The cost of the project for central Government has increased from £3</mark>
7126,<mark>72 billion in 2016 to £8</mark>
7127,<mark>2 billion now</mark>
7128,"<mark> We make these throwaway comments about billions, but imagine having a stack of a million £1 coins and then creating 8,200 stacks of £1 coins</mark>"
7129,<mark>4</mark>
7130,"<mark> But in 2013, the costbenefit analysis supported the Dartford option and was against a crossing east of Gravesend, which then apparently provided a benefit of 1</mark>"
7131,<mark>1</mark>
7132,"<mark> Anyway, at a new cost of £8 billion, any benefit must now be marginal at best</mark>"
7133,"<mark> I can completely understand why that might not matter too much to Kent and Essex County Councils, because it is not money from their budgets, but it is the money of hundreds of millions of people who will remain sitting snarled in their cars in traffic jams at Dartford over the coming decades</mark>"
7134,<mark>2 billion and does not represent value for money for taxpayers</mark>
7135,<mark> Spending £8</mark>
7136,<mark>2 billion to build that white elephant will not address the current problems at Dartford</mark>
7137,"<mark> There will still be oversized vehicles at red traffic lights, and hundreds of millions of people will still spend time stuck in traffic for the next three decades</mark>"
7138,<mark> When it does not address that problem and we have spent £8</mark>
7139,"<mark>2 billion on itI suspect the costs will go uppeople will rightly look at us and say, How on earth have you spent £8</mark>"
7140,"<mark>2 billion on a project that still means, on the very rare occasions when there is a catastrophic failure, that people end up having to sleep in IKEA That is a true fact once the congestion was so bad that nothing could move, IKEA opened its doors, and people slept in its beds and on its sofas</mark>"
7141,"<mark> Friend the Member for Leeds West Rachel Reeves, whose windfall tax proposals would have helped those struggling to get by with a payment of up to £600 per household</mark>"
7142,"<mark> The Chancellor and the Prime Minister had the opportunity to look at a number of policies, including a windfall tax on the energy companies, which would have offered up to £600 of muchneeded help</mark>"
7143,<mark> We are introducing a tax cut for a typical employee that is worth more than £330 in the year from July 2022</mark>
7144,"<mark> Finally, we maintained the 8% higher rate of capital gains tax for landlords compared with the rate for other taxable gains</mark>"
7145,"<mark>I am wondering whether the Minister missed new clause 2, because she did not address the problem</mark>"
7146,"<mark> People were being told yesterday that they should get an extra £330, but they will actually get less than half of that</mark>"
7147,<mark> What is the Government going to do about that The Treasury is clawing back several hundred million pounds from some of the poorest workers in the country</mark>
7148,"<mark>I rise to speak to amendment 1, tabled in my name and that of my hon</mark>"
7149,"<mark>25% increase in national insurance contribution payments without any protection through a higher taxfree allowance, and three months in which families will feel the full force of the Chancellors tax hike without any cushioning from the rising of the national insurance threshold</mark>"
7150,<mark> Mr Usmanov is clearly laughing at this Government; he has moved hundreds of millions of pounds into irrevocable trusts</mark>
7151,"<mark>I warmly congratulate Channel 5 on turning 25, along with Channel 4 on turning 40 and, of course, one of our greatest institutions, the BBC, which is celebrating its centenary in 2022</mark>"
7152,<mark> While the Government have been playing games with the future of the BBC and Channel 4and we welcome the extra funding for the World Servicetheir journalists have risked their lives to report the facts on the front line in Ukraine</mark>
7153,"<mark> Will the Secretary of State give an assurance that any future ownership decisions that she makes on Channel 4 will ensure that its indepth, independent journalism will be protected beyond 2022</mark>"
7154,<mark>What recent assessment her Department has made of the contribution of Channel 5 to public service broadcasting</mark>
7155,"<mark>I congratulate Channel 5 on its 25th anniversary, and I was delighted to attend the parliamentary reception this week to celebrate that significant milestone</mark>"
7156,"<mark> Channel 5 has played an important and awardwinning role in our public service broadcasting system, through its provision of new programming, and its unique focus on childrens television</mark>"
7157,"<mark>As I have said a number of times at the Dispatch Box, a decision has not yet been reached on the future of Channel 4</mark>"
7158,"<mark> Lottery distributors are providing £22 million to help communities become involved, and there will be a series of events between 2 and 6 June, including a special Trooping the Colour event and a service of thanksgiving at St Pauls cathedral</mark>"
7159,"<mark> The busy A2, which runs through the centre of my constituency, is the main road link to the existing crossing at Dartford  that is the problematic one we have heard aboutand the proposed crossing to the east of Gravesend</mark>"
7160,"<mark>I wish first to address amendment 1, which was tabled by the hon</mark>"
7161,<mark> Member for Bath Wera Hobhouse and would bring forward to 6 April the increase to the primary threshold that is introduced in clause 1</mark>
7162,"<mark> Of course the Government want to help people with the cost of living as quickly as possible, which is why the Chancellor introduced a number of measures immediately, including the cutting of fuel duty, which came into force at 6 pm last night</mark>"
7163,"<mark> Its delivery to an April timeline would see millions of individuals paying the incorrect amount of NICs at the start of the tax year, in just two weeks time</mark>"
7164,<mark> That will avoid millions of taxpayers having to make manual claims for refunds</mark>
7165,"<mark> On the points that Members made about poverty, if we look back at the past 10 years, we see that around 1</mark>"
7166,"<mark>3 million fewer people are living in poverty, half a million fewer children are growing up in workless households and hundreds of thousands fewer children are living in poverty</mark>"
7167,"<mark> He announced the first tax cut on his journey to cut taxationthe cutting of the taper rate, which will put £1,000 into the pockets of those on universal credit</mark>"
7168,"<mark> They will have seen the £1 billion household support fund, which is helping people in all our constituencies, building on other measures that were announced at the autumn Budget</mark>"
7169,"<mark> More recently, we have provided £9 billion in energy support</mark>"
7170,"<mark> I reiterate that the changes that we have already made mean that those who are on universal credit will benefit by £1,000 from the cut to the taper rate</mark>"
7171,<mark>25%</mark>
7172,<mark>I want to speak to new clause 2</mark>
7173,"<mark> As I pointed out to him in an intervention, there is an anomalyI hope it is onethat the Government will want to put right when those on universal credit who pay national insurance have their threshold raised to £12,500, the £330 that they gain as a consequence will be subject to the 55% taper</mark>"
7174,"<mark> He announced a number of measures that increased the incomes of the poor, although we should remember that he took away the £20 a week uprating of universal credit</mark>"
7175,<mark> How can that be The poorest workers in the country number 2</mark>
7176,<mark>3 million; I suspect that what the Government  claw back from them will mean hundreds of millions going back to the Treasury</mark>
7177,"<mark> By my calculationI will stand corrected if I am wrongsuch people will gain £330, of which they will lose £171, so the actual gain will be in the region of £159</mark>"
7178,<mark> Subsection 2 aims to find out how much the Government will gain from some of the poorest workers in the country because of the changes</mark>
7179,<mark> I note that the changes to the threshold for selfemployed peoples class 4 contributions take effect in two stages</mark>
7180,"<mark> First, the lower profits limit is raised from £9,880 to £11,908 from April 2022, and then it is raised again to £12,570 in April 2023</mark>"
7181,"<mark> The figure of £11,908 represents, as far as I can tell, a blended average for 202223 of the lower profits limit continuing at the level previously intended until July, and then being raised to £12,570 for the remaining months of the year</mark>"
7182,"<mark> As with class 1 contributions, we will therefore have three months during which the Chancellors NI hike will be in place and hitting peoples pockets, yet the changes to the threshold will not yet have taken effect</mark>"
7183,<mark> This clause also enables the Treasury to make sure that selfemployed people with profits between the small profit threshold and the lower profits limit will continue to be able to build up NI credits but will not pay any class 2 national insurance contributions</mark>
7184,"<mark> I would like, however, to press the Minister on two technical points that arise from clause 3</mark>"
7185,"<mark> First, why are the changes to class 2 contributions to be made by way of regulations, rather than being implemented through this Bill I note that clause 53 seems to make it clear that regulations arising from clause 3 will, as they would amend Acts of Parliament, have to be laid before and approved by a resolution of each House</mark>"
7186,"<mark> Will the Minister explain why the detail on clause 3 will therefore be decided a later stage, and not with the class 1 and class 4 changes today Secondly, clause 32b makes it clear that the changes to class 2 contributions may be made to have retrospective provision from 6 April 2022</mark>"
7187,<mark>1 billion and add to their distress right in the middle of the biggest cost of living crisis since the 1950s</mark>
7188,<mark> A nurse or a midwife on an average salary will see their tax bill rise by £310 next year</mark>
7189,<mark> A care home worker will pay around £140 more and ambulance staff will see a £420 increase</mark>
7190,"<mark> The typical family will see a hit of £1,100 next year, according to the Resolution Foundation</mark>"
7191,<mark> Absolute poverty is set to rise by 1</mark>
7192,"<mark>3 million people, including 500,000 children</mark>"
7193,"<mark> That is why the Chancellor should implement the changes in the Bill not from July, but from April, as that would save working families £2</mark>"
7194,<mark>1 billion in tax payments</mark>
7195,<mark> It would require the Government to produce a report to look at the impact of the 1</mark>
7196,<mark>25% increase in national insurance contributions on disposable incomes</mark>
7197,<mark>75%</mark>
7198,"<mark> I wish to speak against amendment 1, in the name of the hon</mark>"
7199,"<mark> Member for North East Fife Wendy Chamberlain, and against new clause 1, in the name of the right hon</mark>"
7200,<mark> Amendment 1 is simply impractical</mark>
7201,<mark>6% increase in the national living wage</mark>
7202,<mark>2 million people across the country</mark>
7203,"<mark>1 challenge facing my constituency is access to quality healthcare, which, as a former nurse and social worker, I understand acutely</mark>"
7204,"<mark>I tabled new clause 1 because, from now on, I do not think that the House should discuss any legislation that has financial consequences without it understanding or at least having information about the effect on poverty and low pay</mark>"
7205,"<mark> At the moment, 4</mark>"
7206,<mark>3 million children and 2 million pensioners in the UK live in poverty</mark>
7207,"<mark> Overall, 14 million people live in poverty, and that was before the cost of living crisis hit us</mark>"
7208,"<mark> According to analysis today from the Resolution Foundation, 1</mark>"
7209,<mark>3 million more people will be living in poverty</mark>
7210,"<mark> Child poverty is already up by more than 500,000 since 2010, and it is interesting to note that most of those childrenmore than 60%live in households in which one adult works</mark>"
7211,"<mark>1% will drag more than 400,000 more people into poverty, and as we have pointed out time and again during the debate, inflation is forecast to rise over the year to between 7% and 10%</mark>"
7212,<mark> A total of 4</mark>
7213,<mark>8 million workers earn less than the UK real living wage of £9</mark>
7214,"<mark>90 an hour, or £11</mark>"
7215,<mark> The rise in the minimum wage this yeara 6% rise to £9</mark>
7216,"<mark>50 still falls short of the Living Wage Foundations real living wage, and, given that forecast of an inflation rate between 7% and 10%, it is a realterms pay cut</mark>"
7217,<mark>2 per cent in 202223their largest financial year fall on record</mark>
7218,"<mark> According to the IFS, public sector pay has fallen by 3% in real terms in the last year, and is 2% lower in real terms than it was 12 years ago</mark>"
7219,"<mark> The Department for Educations average pay offer to teachers is 4%, and the fact that inflation is so much higher has obviously hit their wage levels</mark>"
7220,<mark>I do not want the Minister to miss the point of new clause 1</mark>
7221,"<mark> Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell Chris Grayling, the then Transport Secretary, opted for Kent and Essexs preferred option, which will do nothing to ameliorate the situation at Dartford and will be yet another massive piece of Government spending on road infrastructure just at the moment in our history when roads are to be optimised by level 5 autonomous vehicles</mark>"
7222,"<mark> The way I think of it is that if we look across the rooftops of London we see thousands of chimneys, none of them used any more</mark>"
7223,<mark> The lefthand one is 4</mark>
7224,<mark>8 metres high and the righthand one is 5 metres high</mark>
7225,"<mark> They are the cause of the horrendous jams, because no fuel tankers or hazardous loads are permitted unescorted, and no vehicles over 5 metres high are permitted at all</mark>"
7226,"<mark> Not only will Dartford be gridlocked, but so will Gravesend and the whole of the A2 eastbound from M25 junction 2</mark>"
7227,"<mark> Some 42% of vehicles using the Dartford crossing are now goods vehicles, which has gone up from 33% in 2019</mark>"
7228,"<mark>3 miles of new road linking the M2A2, A13 and M25</mark>"
7229,"<mark> By almost doubling road capacity across the River Thames east of London, it will cut traffic using the Dartford crossing by 22%, and will provide national road freight with a reliable new connection</mark>"
7230,<mark>5 million vehicles away from Dartford every year</mark>
7231,<mark>I would also like to extend my gratitude on behalf of the Department to Councillor Bob Lane for his engagement</mark>
7232,"<mark> The tunnel itself has been lengthened by around 1 km, and the route has been lowered or hidden behind earth bunds</mark>"
7233,"<mark> Now, around 50% of the route in Gravesham is in the tunnel and 80% of the entire route is hidden from view, either in tunnels or cuttings or behind earth bunds</mark>"
7234,"<mark> Some improvements may well come from building a lower Thames crossing as proposed, because it will move some vehicles awayI cannot remember the current figure; I think it is about 22% of existing usebut the existing crossing will still be above design capacity</mark>"
7235,"<mark> It is very costly, as we have heard, at £8</mark>"
7236,<mark>2 billion</mark>
7237,"<mark> Friend the Member for Gravesham described his 8,200 towers of 1 million coins very aptly</mark>"
7238,"<mark> The commitment one will have to make to the new crossing, as it is so far away from the existing crossing, means that thousands of vehicles will be beyond the point of no return, and my hon</mark>"
7239,<mark> Friend described junction 2of the A2 or the M2</mark>
7240,"<mark> Will we actually need this capacity where it is proposed, or should we be having a rethink If this project goes ahead there are opportunities for businessesindeed, if any small businesses in Thurrock, Essex, Kent or Gravesham are not aware of this, there is a supply chain school, and large tier 1 contractors are looking for local businesses to help them deliver this</mark>"
7241,"<mark> We will still get congestion at the existing Dartford crossing for all the reasons we have heard, and we will be back here trying to find a solution, having spent £8</mark>"
7242,"<mark>2 billion on something that might benefit those who want to get from Dover to Cambridge, but will not benefit those who want to get from Gravesham to Thurrock</mark>"
7243,<mark>3 miles of new roadbut there is an impact from that road on the communities that it will cut through</mark>
7244,"<mark> There is no train link, for example, yet HS1 travels between Kent and Essex</mark>"
7245,"<mark> Cabotage limits can add up to £16,000 a day</mark>"
7246,"<mark> Those are substantial burdens, and most tours of UK orchestras are to Europe such tours represent 12% of their earned income</mark>"
7247,"<mark> We have sanctioned more than 1,000 individuals and entities; there were 65 more announcements today</mark>"
7248,"<mark> Friend was there on Channel 5s opening night, and so were the Spice Girls</mark>"
7249,"<mark> Channel 5 does a huge amount for independent production companies, and one fifth of all its commissioning spending goes to those smaller companies</mark>"
7250,"<mark> That is a larger spend than the BBC, Channel 4 and ITV</mark>"
7251,"<mark>On behalf of the numerous immunosuppressed people in Chesterfield and their families who have contacted me, I thank my hon</mark>"
7252,<mark> Somebody who I know and have been to football with over many years has not been to a game for two and a half years</mark>
7253,"<mark> For example, provisions in the Act have helped the courts and tribunal system to keep functioning throughout the pandemic by allowing thousands of hearings to take place remotely</mark>"
7254,<mark> The Ministry of Justices spending review settlement has put £500 million into addressing the issue</mark>
7255,"<mark> Since the Act was first introduced, we have made huge progress in our fight against the virus thanks to a national vaccination programme that has now put more than 140 million doses in arms</mark>"
7256,"<mark> To be clear, sections 53 to 55 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 enable thousands of hearings to be conducted onlinecurrently around 11,000 per weekso that courts and tribunals can be reserved for hearings, such as trials, that must be heard in court</mark>"
7257,"<mark>I, too, put on record my enormous thanks to all the health and social care workers as well as the many unpaid carerswho have demonstrated extraordinary public service over the last couple of years, and also on a daily basis, day in day outfor the instances of love, care and medical attention for the thousands of people who have recovered, but also the 165,000 who did not</mark>"
7258,<mark> I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to the two motions before the House today on behalf of Her Majestys loyal Opposition</mark>
7259,<mark> It has certainly not gone anywhere for the 1</mark>
7260,"<mark>5 million people who are living with the symptoms of long covid, or the 800,000 clinically vulnerable and immunosuppressed people who continue to call on the Government for better clarity and access to antiviral and retroviral treatment</mark>"
7261,"<mark> Almost 15,000 nurses, midwives and, in England, nursing associates joined these temporary registers to help deal with the impact of the pandemic, as well as more than 10,000 paramedics, operating department practitioners and other professionals, and about 6,500 social workers</mark>"
7262,<mark>7 million jobs</mark>
7263,"<mark> We have also supported the selfemployment income support scheme, which paid out more than £28 billion to nearly 3 million selfemployed people and was one of the most generous schemes for the selfemployed in the world</mark>"
7264,<mark> We made 5 million doses of antivirals available for the immunosuppressed</mark>
7265,"<mark> There are still more than 2 billion people who are unvaccinated, and that will accelerate the risk of new variants that may be even more lethal</mark>"
7266,<mark> Statutory sick pay currently sits at just £96</mark>
7267,<mark> The 2 million lowpaid workers who earn less than the lower earnings limit of £120 receive nothing</mark>
7268,<mark>Motions 3 and 4 will be debated together</mark>
7269,"<mark> So what will stop him making serious mistakes like that again when he exercises his new check and oversight powers in, potentially, hundreds more cases Labour wants victims to have the right to make a new personal statement saying how they would feel if the prisoner is released</mark>"
7270,<mark>5% of reported rape cases ever make it to court</mark>
7271,"<mark> Those that do now take more than 1,000 days, on average, before the trial startsthese are the longest delays in British legal history</mark>"
7272,"<mark> It is striking that, as of last year, only 5% of all Parole Board panel members come from a law enforcement background</mark>"
7273,<mark> 1 thing in the Ockenden review that came out was that staffing shortfalls can make a difference</mark>
7274,<mark> A recent CQC survey shows that almost a quarter of women were unable to get help when they needed it during labour</mark>
7275,"<mark> Does he recognise that the Ockenden review has raised fundamental questions for maternity services across the NHS over the culture of socalled normal birth, and that a focus on targets, under successive Governments, rather than on patient outcomes, can distort clinical best practice and, tragically, patient safety Following his discussion with the trusts current chief executive, which he has mentioned, is he satisfied that the current management and clinical teams have accepted the local actions for learning recommendations in the initial Ockenden report, and are committed to studying and rapidly implementing all further recommendations specific to the trust Finally, what reassurance can he give the thousands of expectant mothers in Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin that the maternity services there are safe, and that patient safety is paramount</mark>"
7276,"<mark> It looks at the experiences of almost 1,500 families from 2000 to 2019</mark>"
7277,"<mark> In 12 cases where a mother died, the report concludes that in three quarters of them, the care could have been significantly improved</mark>"
7278,"<mark> That includes providing £95 million for maternity services across England to boost the maternity workforce and to fund programmes for training, development and leadership</mark>"
7279,"<mark> Just a few days ago, the NHS announced a £127 million funding boost for maternity services across England</mark>"
7280,<mark> I can tell the House that the trust has implemented all the actions set out in the interim report; that was backed at the time by £95 million in extra funding</mark>
7281,"<mark> As I said a moment ago, the final report quite rightly makes many more recommendations, which have all been accepted and which are backed by funding of at least £127 million, much of which will go to workforce</mark>"
7282,"<mark> Lady will have heard me talk about the £95 million given at the time of the interim report, plus the £127 million given for maternity services in the past few days</mark>"
7283,"<mark> Hundreds of thousands of births are delivered through the NHS each year, and the vast majority are completely safe, as I myself have found and as many other Members have found, including my hon</mark>"
7284,<mark> We have thousands of midwives marching on the streets</mark>
7285,<mark> The Department has sneaked out the view that restricting contributions to the cap for those being meanstested for their care charges would save an estimated £900 million by 202728 in cash terms</mark>
7286,"<mark> If the calculation towards the cap is to be changed, that change must come the same way, through crossparty working with the sector, patients and people involved, understanding the evidence on impact and considering the consequencesnot through this halfarsed addition to an NHS reorganisation, which is essentially what the Government are doing</mark>"
7287,"<mark> If we are serious about providing governance that rules out the possibility of the private sector influencing the expenditure of public money, an organisation carrying out the functions of an ICB on its behalf should be a statutory NHS body</mark>"
7288,"<mark> Before the pandemic, adult hospices on average received 34% of their funding from Government, with some receiving little or none</mark>"
7289,"<mark> Hospice funding came primarily from charitable donations, with the sector needing to raise £3</mark>"
7290,<mark>1 million every day</mark>
7291,<mark> That is a direct transfer of £900 million from household wealth to somewhere else</mark>
7292,"<mark> It also true to say that most people will not be affected, because only people on very long care journeys tend to be affected badly,  but there are quite a few of them according to the Departments own figures, about 6,000 a year10 people per constituencywould be affected in this way, and most of them have dementia</mark>"
7293,"<mark> We know that there are 900,000 people with dementia in the UK today; according to the Alzheimers Society, there will be 1</mark>"
7294,"<mark>6 million by 2040; and 70% of care home residents are dementia sufferers, and they are the sort of people who will suffer because of the changes</mark>"
7295,"<mark> The research provided by the Alzheimers Society is clear under the Dilnot proposals, about 50% of people living with dementia benefited fully from the care capthey reached the care cap</mark>"
7296,"<mark> Only 13% of people in the least wealthy quintile will reach the cap, whereas 28% of the most wealthy will</mark>"
7297,<mark> That £900 million has been found from people with less wealth</mark>
7298,<mark> Look at how different regions are affected only 13% of people in the northeast reach the cap whereas 29% of people in the southeast do so</mark>
7299,"<mark> Previously, in almost every part of the country, about 50% of people did so</mark>"
7300,"<mark> First, it is a really terrible way to come up with policy to change a policy halfway through a Bill, because it starves important policies of public debate and parliamentary scrutiny</mark>"
7301,"<mark> Lords amendments 1, 25, 27 and 49 strengthen our approach to mental health</mark>"
7302,"<mark> As the House knows, this Government are committed to tackling health inequalities, and Lords amendments 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 24, 31, 32, 38, 39 and 41 take us further in tackling disparities and levelling up opportunity and outcomes across the country</mark>"
7303,"<mark> Lords amendments 9, 18, 33 and 40 place duties on NHS trusts, foundation trusts, ICBs and NHS England to have regard to the Governments key ambitions on climate change and the natural environment in everything they do</mark>"
7304,"<mark> Unlike schedule 3 to the Care Act 2014, this duty applies to all carers where the patient has care and support needs following discharge; and it applies to young carers as well as adults</mark>"
7305,"<mark> We want to end unpredictable care costs for everyone by introducing a universal £86,000 cap on an individuals personal care costs</mark>"
7306,"<mark> It would be fairer to keep to the original Dilnot proposals, but can the Minister outline how the £900 million saving that, it is estimated, will result from the Governments proposals and the use of meanstesting will better protect those with lowervalue properties</mark>"
7307,"<mark> I have the witness statements of more than 2,000 people who suffered with mental health problems during the pandemic and who wrote to me detailing what that was like</mark>"
7308,"<mark>5 million carers supporting a loved one who may be older, disabled or seriously ill</mark>"
7309,<mark> It is an enormous contribution and saves the health and social care system billions of pounds a year</mark>
7310,"<mark> Friend the Member for South West Surrey Jeremy Hunt, £6</mark>"
7311,<mark>2 billion was spent on locums in the financial year 201920 to plug the gaps</mark>
7312,"<mark> That means 7,500 more medical schools training places in England over the past six years</mark>"
7313,"<mark> The shadow Health Secretary is obviously right to say that the population has grown in recent decades, but I think it has grown by 8% since 2010, while the number of doctors working in our NHS is up by about one third</mark>"
7314,<mark>I draw the Ministers attention to the 2 million Uyghurs who have been detained in concentration camps</mark>
7315,"<mark> The Government are rejecting the amendment because they think it would compel them to train more doctors, which is true, but it ignores the fact that this is the best way to reduce the £6</mark>"
7316,<mark>2 billion locum bill that is currently devastating the NHS budget</mark>
7317,"<mark> Why is there this reluctance to publish the number of doctors we are going to need in 15 years time, given that 97% of hospital bosses say that staff shortages are having an impact on the quality of care they are giving and there are 110,000 vacancies The answer is simple it is because the Government know we are not training enough right now</mark>"
7318,"<mark> This is why it is supported by more than 100 health organisations; every royal college and every health think tank; people in all parts of this House; many peers in the other place, including Lord Stevens, who used to run the NHS; andthis is the point I wish to conclude withby thousands of thousands of doctors and nurses on the frontline</mark>"
7319,"<mark> On Lords amendment 29, does the shadow Minister acknowledge that Macmillan Cancer Support said that it needs an additional 3,371 cancer nurse specialists That would double the nurses by 2030, and it gives us a reason why we need to support Lords amendment 29 and why workforce safety is critical</mark>"
7320,"<mark> I have referred to Macmillan and their request for an additional 3,371 cancer nurse specialists to help address that issue</mark>"
7321,"<mark> Lords amendment 56 clarifies that the powers in part 3 of the Bill in respect of special health authorities apply in relation only to England and crossborder special health authorities, and not Walesonly special health authorities</mark>"
7322,<mark> The monthly workforce statistics for December 2021 show that there are more than 1</mark>
7323,<mark>2 million fulltime equivalent staff</mark>
7324,"<mark> In that context, I highlight the decision made, I believe, under one of my predecessors to expand the number of medical school places from 6,000 to 7,500, which has come on stream</mark>"
7325,"<mark> He and I have discussed the significant increase in percentage terms in the number of radiographers, radiologists and others since 2010, but I acknowledge his underlying point that there is more to do if we are to achieve the ambitions set out in our consultation on the 10year cancer plan and our broader ambitions for cancer care and treatment</mark>"
7326,"<mark> Instead, it is in the unenviable position of having to deal with those ongoing challenges at the same time as trying to address the significant backlog that existed before we went into  the pandemic, when a record 4</mark>"
7327,<mark>5 million people were already on NHS waiting lists</mark>
7328,<mark> Six million people are now waiting for NHS treatmentthe longest waiting lists on recordand they are waiting longer than ever before</mark>
7329,"<mark> The Health Secretary has admitted that the Government will not meet their manifesto commitment to recruit the 6,000 GPs we need to get people seen on time and we know that many cases will simply present in overstretched accident and emergency departments</mark>"
7330,"<mark> It hopes that ignorance is bliss and that we can carry on as we are, and perhaps nobody will noticeeven the 6 million people on NHS waiting lists</mark>"
7331,"<mark> After the scandal of billions in taxpayers money being handed out to mates for duff PPE and testing contracts, and PPE literally going up in smokealong with taxpayers moneywe hope that this is the start of Ministers looking again at where they went wrong during the pandemic</mark>"
7332,<mark> The £1</mark>
7333,"<mark>1 billion given to Wales for test and trace was a Barnett consequential, but we spent only half of that, £533 million, because we used public sector procurement and production effectively</mark>"
7334,"<mark> There are 93,000 NHS staff vacancies; £6 billionplus has been spent on temporary staff to fill gaps; and more than half of staff are working unpaid extra hours each week, with 44% saying that they have felt ill with workrelated issueslittle wonder, given that retention remains a huge issue</mark>"
7335,<mark> One survey shows that public satisfaction ratings with the NHS are reported to be at a 25year lowa quarter of a century of surveys thereand another shows that the number of NHS staff who would recommend their trust as a place to work has plummeted</mark>
7336,"<mark>I have another role as Minister for Levelling Up Communities, and the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities recently invested £300 million in a flagship programme to support the families who need help the most</mark>"
7337,<mark> They are taking tens of thousands of people</mark>
7338,<mark> Given that 1</mark>
7339,"<mark>4 million EU citizens who are registered to work in Britain have decided to stay in Europe, should we not be opening our hearts and homes and recognise the benefits some of them would bring by working in the NHS</mark>"
7340,<mark>1 job</mark>
7341,"<mark> Does that impact assessment then mean we cannot do that because we do not want to lose £20 millionor £20 billion or whatever it happens to bebecause that is too expensive, and that we will on balance therefore purchase from a known slave labour provider Is that what we are saying Is that what the impact assessment will say to us I say to those who call for an impact assessment be careful what you call for</mark>"
7342,"<mark>Social mobility is a laudable aim that everyone in the House agrees with, but this week I was shocked to see Action for Children report that nearly half of children surveyed from lowincome backgrounds say that they worry about their families finances</mark>"
7343,"<mark> For example, wealthier people who entirely selffund their own residential care are likely to have to spend £86,000 of their own money if they live in a residential home for just over three years</mark>"
7344,"<mark> Somebody who starts with £100,000 of assets would need to draw on care and support in a residential home for about 10 years to have to spend the same amount</mark>"
7345,"<mark> For that reason, we urge the House to reinstate clause 40 and schedule 6</mark>"
7346,"<mark> The National Cyber Security Centre has managed an unprecedented 777 cyber incidents over the last 12 months, up from 723 the previous year, with 40% aimed at the public sector</mark>"
7347,<mark> We know that Russiansourced cyber attacks rose by 800% in the 48 hours immediately after Putins renewed attack on Ukraine</mark>
7348,"<mark>According to the National Audit Office investigation into the management of PPE contracts, billions of pounds of taxpayers money is still at risk</mark>"
7349,"<mark> Between March 2020 and October 2021, it cost £737 million to store excess PPE, and costs are currently £7 million per month</mark>"
7350,"<mark> Over half the VIP suppliers provided PPE that the Department of Health and Social Care considers unsuitable for frontline services; in addition, some 1</mark>"
7351,<mark>5 billion items of PPE are currently in storage and expected to expire before they can be distributed</mark>
7352,"<mark>The Minister talks about value for money, yet we know that the Government handed hundreds of millions of pounds of our money to an offshore company involving a Tory peer, created just days before and without any transparency, that sold Government PPE at three times the price it had bought it for</mark>"
7353,"<mark> The Government succeeded in getting domestic production, excluding gloves, up from 1% to 70%</mark>"
7354,"<mark> Gentleman refers to 50% of suppliers having something faulty all that means is that in a shipment that may have been of tonnes of PPE, one item was faulty</mark>"
7355,<mark> It does not mean that 50% of the items received were faulty</mark>
7356,"<mark> There is around £250 billionworth of public procurement and around £50 billionworth of central Government public procurement, and I am extremely keen that SMEs in Northern Ireland are able to get visibility of that pipeline, so that we can tap into the talent and entrepreneurial spirit of which the hon</mark>"

7361,"<mark> As of September last year, the median monthly rent in Hackney is £1,600, but for a onebedroom apartment it is £1,350 a month and for a threebedroom apartment it is £2,220 a month</mark>"

7363,"<mark> I should perhaps repeat that for those who think I may have slipped a nought into the wrong place £750,000</mark>"
7364,"<mark> We have at least 93 buildings in Hackney classed as high risk for cladding, but many more with small amounts of cladding need their wretched EWS1 form, and this is proving really difficult</mark>"
7365,"<mark> It was their home that they wanted to live in, and they just cannot sell it because of the EWS1 form and the cladding</mark>"

7371,<mark> This is just one example where it has been made clear that HS2 is being constructed with a complete lack of consideration for the environments it is destroying and people it is impacting</mark>
7372,<mark> It seems that HS2 Ltd and its contractors are doing neither</mark>
7373,"<mark> Just before Christmas, HS2 Ltd presented some of my constituents with the gift of a notice of entry declaring that it would be entering their homes to install movement monitoring apparatus</mark>"
7374,<mark> I am sure Members can imagine how distressing it was when my constituents were then unable to contact HS2 Ltd for weeks to understand what that meant in practice</mark>
7375,"<mark> HS2 Ltd is failing to communicate transparently, exacerbating the already strained relationship with communities, who feel they are having this project imposed on them</mark>"
7376,"<mark> HS2 Ltd is treating its interactions with people and the environment like a tickbox exercise, doing no more than meeting minimum requirements</mark>"

7382,"<mark> The Governments resettlement scheme for Afghans has placed more than 6,000 people and continues to be supportive, but he was right to make that point</mark>"
7383,"<mark> Once again, that is worth flagging in the Houseit is something the Government take seriously, which is why we have invested more than £30 million in our safer streets and safety of women at night funds to help women and girls to feel safer</mark>"
7384,<mark> The Government have made £520 million available to improve access to general  practice</mark>
7385,<mark> Tens of thousands of people throughout the country have made a very generous offer and they want to be able to extend that and for it to be taken up</mark>
7386,<mark> I recognise the challenge that HS2 must be bringing to that part of the world with the construction that is taking place in her patch</mark>
7387,<mark> Hopefully that pain will soon be over and we will be able to ride on HS2 once it has finished its construction process</mark>

7420,"<mark>I must draw the Houses attention to the fact that financial privilege is engaged by Lords amendments 6, 17, 22 to 30, 103, 104, 111 to 113, 116, 120 to 127, 137 and 138</mark>"

7429,"<mark> The Bill would further expand the number of people without access to public funds such as welfare benefits and housing assistance, and thereby ensure that thousands more refugees a year fleeing war and persecution are at increased risk of falling into destitution and homelessness once they have reached the UK</mark>"
7430,<mark> I urge all Members to support Lords amendment 6B to ensure that refugees living in the UK are not forced into poverty and destitution</mark>
7431,<mark> An estimated 80 million people are displaced by conflicts and instability around the world</mark>
7432,"<mark> For nearly 20 years, it has been possible under UK law to remove individuals from the UK while their asylum claim is pending if a certificate is issued under schedule 3 of the Asylum and Immigration Treatment of Claimants, etc Act 2004</mark>"
7433,<mark> At an annual cost of around £1</mark>
7434,"<mark>5 billion, it is the highest in more than two decades</mark>"
7435,"<mark> Every day, the cost of the broken system on hotels alone is nearly £5 million</mark>"
7436,<mark> I shall be quick and focus on Lords amendment 7</mark>
7437,<mark> Friend accept that Lords amendments 7B  and 7C have been qualified to make the proper concession that people seeking asylum should not be given preferential treatment to those who already have refugee status and that there is a builtin review period I and others have said on many occasions that there is simply no evidence to suggest that a limited right to work is a pull factor</mark>
7438,"<mark> It will not tackle the 12,000long queue of Afghan refugees loyal to Britain who are currently languishing in hotels, alongside a further 25,000 asylum seekers, at an eyewatering cost to the British taxpayer of £4</mark>"
7439,<mark>7 million daily</mark>
7440,"<mark> It is caused by this Home Secretary, on whose watch we have seen a staggering 60% drop in processed claims</mark>"
7441,"<mark> Contrasting that with the £11,000 that it costs to process an asylum seeker here in the UK, we start to see the impact on the public purse</mark>"
7442,<mark> Then there is the £120 million in development aid</mark>
7443,"<mark> There can be absolutely no doubt that the Governments claim that Rwanda is a safe country for refugees will be challenged in the courts given that thousands of Rwandans seek asylum in Europe every year, with 76 Rwandan citizens granted asylum here in the UK since 2017</mark>"
7444,"<mark> Labour Members have continually made the case that the Bill must meet Britains obligations under the 1951 UN refugee convention, and we are supporting Lords amendment 5B, which secures this</mark>"
7445,"<mark> First, we support  Lords amendment 6B, which seeks to ensure that all refugees are given their convention rights and that family unity is maintained, even if the Government are determined to introduce the utterly inappropriate differential treatment aspect of this Bill, which, shamefully, contravenes the UN convention</mark>"
7446,"<mark> For example, only 13% of land in the UK is owned by womenin other words, 87% is owned by menand boys are twice as likely as girls to inherit family businesses</mark>"
7447,<mark> Friend always raises pertinent issues on behalf of his constituents in Winchester</mark>
7448,"<mark> If a leaseholder property is valued at less than £175,000, or £325,000 in London, the leaseholder will pay nothing and, if the leaseholder has already met interim costs that exceed the contributions cap, they will pay nothing</mark>"
7449,"<mark> The Government originally proposed that leaseholders contributions be capped at £10,000, or £15,000 in Greater London, and we believe that creates a fair balance</mark>"
7450,"<mark> We are therefore restoring the caps at £10,000 outside London and £15,000 in London, as originally proposed, and have made a small number of other technical improvements to those measures</mark>"
7451,"<mark>As I understand it, the difficulty is that a claim would need to be made on behalf of leaseholders by their landlord, who would insist on indemnity funding</mark>"
7452,"<mark> However, we recognise that any subsidy regime must provide sufficient transparency and accountability for the spending of billions of pounds of public money each year</mark>"
7453,"<mark> As of today, DP World is still a partner in the London Gateway freeport and is potentially set to benefit from £25 millionworth of public funding</mark>"
7454,<mark>5 million threshold for subsidies to services of public economic interest were far too high</mark>
7455,"<mark> Lords amendments 26 to 30 and 32 lower the threshold for publishing subsidies to services of public economic interest to £100,000</mark>"
7456,"<mark> In Committee, Labour tabled new clause 3, which would have given the CMA the power to investigate subsidies that may be of concern and subsidy schemes on its own initiative</mark>"
7457,"<mark> I am therefore pleased that the Lords tabled Lords amendment 9, which removes the relocation prohibition on subsidies that work to reduce social and economic disadvantages</mark>"
7458,"<mark> It reduces the threshold for subsidies to be included in the transparency database from £500,000 to £100,000</mark>"
7459,"<mark> The threshold of £500,000 was too high for us to have a good enough overview, and that is without mentioning peoples inability to challenge subsidies if they do not know they exist</mark>"
7460,"<mark> Setting the threshold at £100,000 makes it much less likely that a company will be badly damaged by a harmful subsidy that it is unable to challenge because of the lack of transparency</mark>"
7461,"<mark> Schedule 2 contains a lot of commonsense principles already, which support the UKs priorities on net zero and protecting the environment</mark>"
7462,<mark> I am massively concerned that net zero is included only in schedule 2 and not in schedule 1</mark>
7463,"<mark> If the Government are not prepared to come to any kind of compromise with the House of Lords, would it not be even better for all these powers to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament, so that the people of Scotland could build the kind of humane immigration and asylum system that hundreds of constituents in Glasgow North have lobbied me to advocate for in this House</mark>"
7464,"<mark> She needs to hire more caseworkers and invest in the court system, so that we can process applications quickly and dramatically reduce the ludicrous £4</mark>"

7468,"<mark> Since then, thousands of leaseholders have been forced to live with the anxiety of being in unsafe buildings through no fault of their own</mark>"
7469,"<mark> On the point about the building cost thresholds, he will know that the London median house price is £515,000, but in Runnymede and Weybridge it is £475,000</mark>"
7470,"<mark> There is a general welcome for the Governments attempts to take a more proportionate approach and for moving away, albeit over a period of time, from EWS1 forms to PAS 9980, which can cover whole blocks rather than individual properties</mark>"
7471,"<mark> The two questions that the Select Committee has not had answers  to are, first, whether the Government will look at making the building regulator responsible for deciding which blocks need this new assessment rather than the building owners, who might have a particular interest in saying no; and, secondly, whether he will ensure that the professional indemnity insurance scheme also applies to assessors on the PAS 9980 assessments as well as to those on the EWS1 forms</mark>"
7472,"<mark> That was going to solve everything, but obviously it was not, even when the Chancellor stood up and offered in his Budget the £1 billion building safety fund and said that was going to give everything the Select Committee had asked for, which it was not and did not</mark>"
7473,<mark> The National Housing Federation has said that up to £10 billion could be needed to remediate social housing</mark>
7474,"<mark> The G15 group of social housing landlords has said that, for their properties alone, it could be over £3 billion</mark>"
7475,"<mark> Friend raised about what happens if leaseholders have already paid up to the £10,000 cap but there are further costs</mark>"
7476,"<mark> What happens in those circumstances It would be scandalous if leaseholders who have already paid the £10,000, or £15,000 in London, were to suffer that for want of someone to pay the bill</mark>"
7477,"<mark> As has been said, many of those people have been presented with eyewatering bills, such as £250,000 or more, to fix fire safety issues that are definitely not their fault, are clearly the responsibility of the developer in the first place and should have been put right since</mark>"
7478,"<mark> It cannot be fair, or in keeping with natural justice, that in some cases the single determinant of whether someone has to pay £10,000 or £15,000and someone else does notis the arbitrary fact of whether the Government can find another party to carry the can</mark>"
7479,"<mark> The valuation of properties could leave one flat liable for £10,000 or even £15,000, while an identical flat in the same block could be exempt</mark>"
7480,"<mark> Of course, I was not nearly as cynical as the leaseholders who were facing bills for tens of thousands of pounds and were wondering whether the issue would just be kicked down the road and into the long grass</mark>"
7481,"<mark> Member for Sheffield South East Mr Betts, who said that if a building were 1 cm lower than it needed to be, that could be the most expensive centimetre in history</mark>"
7482,<mark> Leaseholders in buildings above 18 metres are already protected by the Governments £5</mark>
7483,<mark>1 billion building safety fund for the removal of unsafe cladding</mark>
7484,"<mark> Assessments carried out in accordance with the new PAS 9980 principles should produce more proportionate responses than costly and, ultimately, unnecessary remediation</mark>"
7485,<mark> The Government have been clear in their view that an EWS1 form should not be required for buildings below 18 metres in height</mark>
7486,"<mark> Given the small number of buildings involved, a blanket legislative intervention bringing hundreds of thousands more buildings into scope to deal with an issue affecting just a handful of buildings would be entirely disproportionate</mark>"
7487,<mark> Enfranchised buildings are eligible for the £5</mark>
7488,<mark>1 billion building safety fund in the same way as other buildings</mark>
7489,"<mark> Gentleman is right that it would not be appropriate for me to speak on behalf of the Welsh Government, and I do not think they would like that either</mark>"
7490,<mark> Social housing providers will not be subject to provisions that stipulate that building owners and landlords with a net worth of more than £2 million per inscope building must pay all inscope remediation costs</mark>
7491,"<mark> Friend the Member for Worthing West Sir Peter Bottomley, let me say that we are retrospectively extending the limitation period under section 1 of the Defective Premises Act</mark>"
7492,"<mark> Mandale House, in my constituency, faces a range of problems, and has secured £3</mark>"
7493,<mark>4 million from the building safety fund towards the necessary remediation</mark>
7494,"<mark> However, that falls short of what is needed, and Mandale House is left with £7</mark>"
7495,<mark>4 million to find in order to complete the work</mark>
7496,"<mark> Six years later, those responsible were fined more than £300,000 because their fire protection work had been clearly inadequate</mark>"
7497,"<mark> I am not talking about people who live in big, expensive, multimillionpound apartments looking out over the Thames</mark>"
7498,"<mark>May I suggest that it would be a good idea if the Government had a roundtable with the insurers about what informal provision they are making in case there are successful actions, and about whether they would like voluntarily to contribute, say, £4 billion to £5 billion No residential leaseholder would then carry the cost, and the insurance company would know that it would not be chased with legal claims that were likely to succeed</mark>"
7499,"<mark> Leaseholders can still have to pay up to £15,000 if funds cannot be recovered from the developer or freeholder, and leaseholders in buildings under 11 metres are entirely excluded</mark>"
7500,<mark> Large sections of the Bill have been completely rewritten on the basis of hundreds of Government amendments tabled in the other place that the noble Lords had relatively little time to consider carefully or properly scrutinise</mark>
7501,"<mark> Lords amendment 6 specified fourfire suppression systems, the safety of stairways and ramps, the certification of electrical equipment, and provision for people with disabilitiesand we supported it</mark>"
7502,"<mark> Having maintained in the other place that the amendment was entirely unnecessary, the Government yesterday tabled an amendment in lieu of Lords amendment 6 that almost entirely mirrors its provisions</mark>"
7503,<mark> 1508</mark>
7504,<mark> 1509</mark>
7505,"<mark> Four and a half years after Grenfell, the Bill needs to be amended to reflect and deal with this issue</mark>"
7506,"<mark> As it stands, buildings held in trust on behalf of a thirdparty investor,  where the landlord is a professional depository or custodian regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, or buildings owned on trust by what I can only describe as ground rent grazersalmost invariably based offshoredo not meet any of the association tests or the net wealth test in the Bill</mark>"
7507,"<mark> Unless the Bill is revised to capture such trustee arrangements, they will escape the socalled waterfall system as set out in schedule 8, and the leaseholders will find themselves picking up a proportion of the costs of noncladding remediation</mark>"
7508,"<mark> Although we fully acknowledge that the waterfall system now set out in schedule 8 provides leaseholders with a far greater degree of protection than the Bill as originally drafted proposed, it does not protect them fully</mark>"
7509,<mark>2 billion</mark>
7510,<mark> I want to represent the leaseholders in Monument Court in my constituency who at the momentI will speak to the Minister about thisare being sent bills by Higgins Homes for 50% of costs</mark>
7511,"<mark> They are already getting £10 million from the building safety fund, and they need to find £5 million from leaseholders</mark>"
7512,"<mark> In my constituency, leaseholders who are affected would not pay a single penny, because the Secretary of State gave a commitment from the Dispatch Box in a previous debate that waking watch costs that had already been paid over the past five yearsextended to 10 years, which we are very pleased about and did not even ask forwould contribute towards the £10,000</mark>"
7513,"<mark> Up and down the country millions of leaseholders have won, but we must turn that victory into reality</mark>"
7514,"<mark> As we know, at the moment millions of them are trapped</mark>"
7515,"<mark> Because we know that the most that any leaseholder will ever paytechnically, in theoryis £10,000, we have created value again in every single one of those properties</mark>"
7516,"<mark> We have got the market moving again, because everybody knows that they will not have to face what in the case of Vista Tower is a remediation bill of £180,000 or £200,000 on a £180,000 flat</mark>"
7517,"<mark> Indeed, a recent survey by End our Cladding Scandal of more than 2,200 properties and buildings over 11 metres tall shows that more than 64% of leaseholders outside London and more than 83% of leaseholders in London will not be protected from the costs of noncladding fire safety defects</mark>"
7518,"<mark> Leaseholders in buildings that are under 11 metres remain unprotected, and there is still no funding commitment from house builders for the £4 billion required for the remediation of buildings where the developer no longer exists</mark>"
7519,"<mark>I beg to move, That this House agrees with Lords amendment 1</mark>"
7520,"<mark> First, in place of the higher transparency thresholds that applied to subsidies given under a published scheme, and given as minimal financial assistance or services of public economic interest assistance, we have introduced a single upload threshold of £100,000, which now applies to all subsidies that are subject to the transparency requirements</mark>"
7521,"<mark> This represents a substantial 80% reduction from the original threshold of £500,000 for subsidies given under the schemes</mark>"
7522,"<mark> On insurance, which has been my bugbear as well, it is not just that many of the insurance companies insured the development beforehand, and therefore provided a warranty of sorts, but that since then they have increased premiums on leaseholders, sometimes by more than 1,000%</mark>"
7523,"<mark> There is an important distinction between companies or businesses with which the Government may be working to achieve policy objectives, and their eligibility still to receive public subsidies, potentially to the tune of hundreds of thousands of pounds or millions, where they have explicitly even admitted to this House that they have broken employment law</mark>"
7524,"<mark>With less than 2% of the Conservative parliamentary party in the Chamber, it must be beyond debate that the Prime Minister will be investigated by the Privileges Committee</mark>"
7525,"<mark> More seriously, it is also coming at a cost to the publics faith in political leadership, such as it is, except, I am pleased to say, in Scotland, where Scottish Tory votersincluding in my Angus constituencyneeded to take only one look at this Prime Minister for Tory seats in Scotland to fall by 55% at the 2019 election</mark>"
7526,<mark> He is a disgrace to the office of Prime Minister and an insult to the millions of the electorate who played by the book</mark>
7527,"<mark> Is it not important that we have this inquiry now to understand whether that has happened and there has been a repeated offence against the House   In the past year, half of the public have lost what little trust they had in politicians</mark>"
7528,"<mark> On the point about repeated offences and forgiveness, I would encourage her to look at Romans 7</mark>"
7529,"<mark> 10 and showing complete contempt for his own rules, workingclass communities and young people in overcrowded flats all over Britain were in lockdown The mental health crisis that we still have around us was intensified by the very strict operation of those rules, and many young people faced massive £10,000 fines for organising parties</mark>"
7530,"<mark> For context, in the same period the parties took place we were held to a strict oneparent bedside rule, and were only allowed to swap every 5 nights</mark>"
7531,<mark> The Prime Minister has to accept that this is not just a Westminster row that nobody outside SW1 is concerned about</mark>
7532,"<mark> No fewer than 190,000 people have died from covid, and more than 1 million people have long covid</mark>"
7533,"<mark> We rigidly followed all the rules, including my mums funeral in 2020 with just 6 peopleI lost my sister last year, to a late diagnosis of stage 4 lung cancer</mark>"
7534,"<mark>On 5 and 6 July in London, the largest international gathering hosted by the UK Government this year will take placethe 2022 international ministerial conference on freedom of religion or belief</mark>"
7535,"<mark> The campaigning charity Open Doors, in its 2022 world watch list, states that the persecution of Christians has now reached the highest levels since the world watch list began nearly 30 years agothat across 76 countries, more than 360 million Christians suffer high or very high levels of persecution and discrimination for their faith</mark>"
7536,"<mark> It is heartwarming to note, particularly following the publication of the Truro review slightly more than two and a half years ago, how increasingly Government are engaging on this issue, and not just expressing concern, but taking practical steps</mark>"
7537,"<mark> We have committed £3 million over five years to the UNESCO global media defence fund, which has supported more than 1,700 journalists, including many of those who have received threats online</mark>"
7538,<mark> We also support media freedom through our development aid budget and have spent more than £400 million on that over the past five years</mark>

7544,"<mark> I have hundreds of emails from constituents; I wanted to read some out, but there is not time</mark>"
7545,"<mark> Many people have written to me asking why he has only been given a  50 quid fine while others are being fined up to £10,000 for breaches of the rules</mark>"
7546,"<mark> From that same poll, conducted by Compassion in Politics, we learnt that 47% of people have lost trust in UK politicians during the past 12 months</mark>"

7548,"<mark> Even when he was challenged with photographic evidence of him partying away while millions were stuck at home, he absurdly pleaded his innocence</mark>"
7549,"<mark>The motion refers to the Prime Ministers comments in this place on 1 and 8 December 2021, but these are simply specimens</mark>"
7550,"<mark> We know that MPsmost of uswork incredibly hard on behalf of our constituents, but the reality is that the actions of the lawbreaking Prime Minister further push the false narrative that all politicians are the same</mark>"
7551,"<mark> When Members assume good faith on behalf of our opponents, we can explore, test and interrogate our reasonable disagreements about how we achieve our common goals</mark>"
7552,"<mark> Our constituents are genuinely upset and sincerely believe that the Prime Minister has liedin fact, YouGov has just published an opinion poll that shows that 78% of the public think he has</mark>"
7553,"<mark> I spend a lot of my time trying to talk to the public about that element of politics, and to explain why 99% of people in this building came here</mark>"
7554,"<mark> I am afraid to say, however, that it is the very rare 1% who we are discussing today, because I do not believe that that is true of the Prime Minister</mark>"
7555,"<mark> The debate may continue for as long as it takes unless either there is a successful closure motion to bring the debate to an end or we reach 5 oclock, in which case the debate will be adjourned to a future day</mark>"

7559,"<mark> 1 point is that it has been shown that a consequence of this aggression is the expansion of NATO, not a contraction, and plenty of other countries are watching</mark>"

7563,<mark> 1 issue of concern</mark>
7564,"<mark> Some 13,000 Ukrainian lives have been lost in fighting since then</mark>"
7565,"<mark> Since 2015, the UK has helped to build the resilience and capabilities of the Ukrainian armed forces through Operation Orbital, which has trained more than 22,000 Ukrainian troops</mark>"
7566,"<mark> We should not forget the thousands of Ukrainians who have lost their lives defending their  country and who, every day, are murdered by snipers from across the divide</mark>"
7567,"<mark> We wish to be friends with the Russian people, as we have been for hundreds of years</mark>"
7568,"<mark> On his point about ethnic nationalism, it is something that in the UK is against our DNA, because of the lessons we have seen over hundreds of years</mark>"
7569,"<mark> We remain clear that Russias actions in recent weeks and months, with the massing of 100,000 combatready troops, tanks and heavy military equipment near Ukraines eastern border, is unacceptable</mark>"
7570,"<mark> In those 17 pages, NATO appears in one paragraph</mark>"
7571,"<mark> We enhance and work our relationship with Finland and Sweden through the joint expeditionary force, which is 11 nationsScandinavian and Nordic, and Britainworking together and exercising together in the defence world</mark>"
7572,"<mark> Among other things, Germany has made it plain that Nord Stream 2 cannot go aheadGermany cannot take part in itif there is a Russian invasion of Ukraine</mark>"
7573,"<mark> Everybodyparticularly the Americans; he heard what I said about the 8,500 troops getting ready to go to Europecan see the need now to move NATO forces, to fortify NATOs eastern flank</mark>"
7574,"<mark>Short, concise questions please, because I will be finishing this statement at 20 past 2</mark>"
7575,"<mark> Can that be confirmed as on the table today The measures must also include tougher action on Russian money laundering and include action by the Treasury to tackle the ongoing and improper use of Scottish limited partnerships, which have been used to funnel millions of pounds in dirty money</mark>"
7576,"<mark> Do not forget, it is quite right to say that 41% of Russias GDP comes from oil and gas</mark>"
7577,<mark>Is this the wakeup call that NATO needs so that all its members finally meet their obligations to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defence</mark>
7578,"<mark>I remind the House that we do actually guarantee the sovereignty of Ukraine, having signed the Budapest memorandum in 1994, along with the United States and Russia, and I think later France, and even China</mark>"
7579,"<mark> In 2014, the seizure of Crimea was discussed in the Security Council on seven occasions, I think</mark>"
7580,"<mark> Is the Prime Minister not concerned, given the answer he just gave about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and the fact that discussions are still continuing about exclusion from the SWIFT system, that we are not demonstrating determined, united resolve at the very moment when we need the credible threat of strong sanctions to try and deter President Putin from invading Ukraine</mark>"
7581,"<mark> That was the fantastic achievement of the end of the cold war, the fall of the Berlin wall, and that high moment in 1990 when we had a Europe whole and free</mark>"
7582,<mark>7 of that treaty</mark>
7583,"<mark>The Prime Minister will know that Ukraine is not a full member of NATO, but may I ask him to comment on the feasibility of direct military action by NATO, notwithstanding that article 5 does not apply</mark>"
7584,"<mark> We have sent 2,000 antitank weapons to  the Ukrainians and we join the Americans in that effort; as my right hon</mark>"
7585,"<mark> Friend knows, the Americans have sent about $650 millionworth of military assistance to Ukraine</mark>"
7586,"<mark> I am sure he has read the 5,000word essay by Vladimir Putin about Ukraine and the origins of Russia</mark>"
7587,<mark> We already have a very wide package of sanctions in place since the Russian incursion of 2014</mark>
7588,<mark> I am afraid he is not right in what he says about abandoning Ukraine since 2014</mark>
7589,"<mark> With Operation Orbital, the UK has been out there in the front, helping to train 21,000 Ukrainian troops since 2015</mark>"
7590,<mark> I have been saying for a very long time that the arguments that President Putin uses about Russian speakers in Ukraine are exactly the same as Adolf Hitler advanced over the Sudeten Germans in Czechoslovakia in the 1930s</mark>
7591,<mark> I am sure there will be other sanctions comingI do not quite understand why we have sanctioned only 25% of the people the  American Government have already sanctioned</mark>
7592,<mark>President Putin has not even waited for the gas to start flowing through the Nord Stream 2 pipeline before exploiting the stranglehold that he has been building on the German economy</mark>
7593,<mark>A percentage of our natural gas comes from Russia and Putin has already said that he will turn off the taps if he deems Moscow to be unfairly sanctioned by the west</mark>
7594,"<mark> Could I ask him to take further action on energy, as I did during the Russian invasion of Crimea Alongside all the measures he rightly proposed in his statement, will he convene a summit of the G7 Energy Ministers, as we had back in 2014, to look at how we can improve shortterm and mediumterm energy security, protect consumers in this country and elsewhere against rocketing gas prices and give ourselves a much stronger hand in the face of Putins aggression</mark>"
7595,"<mark> We have to be respectful of this, but the simple fact is that about 3% the UKs gas supplies come from Russia, whereas about 36% of German energy needs come from Russian gas</mark>"
7596,"<mark> As I told the House just now, only 3% of our gas supplies come from Russia, but he is right about the spike in prices, which is why we are working together with President Biden and other colleagues to see what we can do to increase the supply of gas both to Europe and of course to this country</mark>"
7597,"<mark> Actually, Russian gas comprises only 3% of the UKs gas supplies, but we have to mitigate the impact of the  cost of energy on families with the cold weather payments and everything that we are doing to increase the living wageall the support that we are giving families throughout the winter and beyond</mark>"
7598,"<mark> But I reassure the House and the country that I and the whole Government are focused 100% on dealing with the peoples priorities, including the UKs leading role in protecting freedom around the world</mark>"
7599,"<mark> Russia has, of course, already attacked Ukraine, illegally annexing 10,000 square miles of her territory in 2014 and igniting a war in the Donbass region</mark>"
7600,"<mark> Last week, the UK acted to strengthen Ukraines ability to defend her soil by supplying antiarmour missiles and deploying a small training team of British personnel, in addition to the work of Operation Orbital, which, as the House will know, has trained 21,000 Ukrainian troops since 2015</mark>"
7601,"<mark> Denmark is sending a frigate to the Baltic and deploying four F16s to Lithuania to join NATOs longstanding air policing mission; France has expressed its readiness to send troops to Romania under NATO command; and the United States has raised the alert level of 8,500 combat troops, preparing to deploy them in Europe at short notice</mark>"
7602,"<mark> We cannot bargain away the vision of a Europe whole and free that emerged in those amazing years from 1989 to 1991, healing the division of our continent by the iron curtain</mark>"
7603,"<mark> More than half of Europe, including a dozen or more members of NATO and of the European Union, would be only partially sovereign and required to seek the Kremlins approval before inviting any military personnel from NATO countries on to their soil</mark>"
7604,"<mark> The Czech Republicat the very heart of Europe, hundreds of miles from Russiawould have to ask the Kremlin for permission if she wanted to invite a company of German infantry to join an exercise or even to help with flood defences</mark>"
7605,"<mark> It is therefore important that we demonstrate that although Ukraine is not in NATO, we can do our best to protect its right to choose; and it is also important that we make it crystal clear to the President of Russia that if he tries this with NATO partners, no matter how big or small, article 5 is a reality</mark>"
7606,<mark>The President of the United States made it very clear that he will stop Nord Stream 2</mark>
7607,"<mark> Friend specifically about sanctions Will the UK, when it presents its package, ensure that its sanctions are synchronised with those of the United States, that they include action to prevent UK banks from handling foreign currency transfers from Russian stateowned banks, and that they also include what I know our colleagues in the United States Senate would like to includespecific sanctions against Nord Stream 2</mark>"
7608,"<mark> Yemen gets about 20% of its food from Ukrainian grain; for Libya, the figure is 44%</mark>"
7609,"<mark> Will he comment on a specific loophole relating to where Russia gets its money from Under the International Monetary Funds special drawing rights, $650 billion was allocated to states around the world last year, and Russia got $17</mark>"
7610,<mark>5 billion</mark>
7611,"<mark> That is done by our forces, and it is why we have made even more available, including 1,000 members of the Army currently on standby in the UK to send elsewhere</mark>"
7612,"<mark> The purpose of that extra £24 billion was to modernise our armed forces, and also to ensure that we are able to enter new domains where we are threatened by both Russia and other adversaries</mark>"
7613,"<mark> We also fully support moves to reinforce the security of NATO allies, as the Labour leader and I told the Secretary General at NATO headquarters earlier this month</mark>"
7614,"<mark>What will the Government do to try to impress on President Putin that even if he invades the rest of Ukraine without military comeback on behalf of Ukraine, it would be a fatal error for him to think that he could then invade an outlying NATO stateone of the Baltic states, for examplewithout an attack on one rightly being considered to be an attack on all NATO members</mark>"
7615,"<mark> Although I accept that NATOs potential for direct intervention is limited due to article 5, what planning is there for a possible crossborder refugee and humanitarian catastrophe</mark>"
7616,"<mark> Does he want to apologise for that remark, which was not only crass, but undermined efforts to deliver Minsk II as the starting point for our best chance of avoiding war Does he accept that if the Government are serious about playing a constructive role, they should start by getting their own house in orderfirst of all by repaying the almost £2 million that his party has received in Russian donations since the Prime Minister took office Will he finally end Londons role in hiding the proceeds of Kremlinconnected corruption</mark>"
7617,"<mark> However, Russian aggression against Ukraine threatens the strategic supply of food around the world, because Ukraine is the third biggest exporter of grain, at 100 million tonnes a year, so what assessment has he made of the areas of the world that are most likely to be affected if aggression should lead to that food not being available Does he not agree that that underlines the strategic importance of Ukraine and the importance of giving it every bit of support to allow it to defend its independence, democracy and vital economic role</mark>"
7618,"<mark> If 1 million refugees appear in Hungary, Romania or Poland, I would urge the EU to step up and think about what it is going to do about millions of refugees on its soil rather than think about it afterwards</mark>"
7619,"<mark> Gentlemans behalf, to engage with the National Crime Agency to see what more we can do</mark>"
7620,<mark> The British Government are continually exhorting our European friends to exceed the 2% threshold</mark>
7621,"<mark> It would be a great thing if we could get some of them up to 2%, never mind 3%</mark>"
7622,"<mark> I think there are about 1,100 currently still in Ukraine, and there is a helpline that people should ring</mark>"
7623,<mark> It is 01908 516666</mark>
7624,"<mark> I am expecting to run this statement until around 2 oclock, so short questions and pithy answers would certainly be helpful</mark>"
7625,<mark> Friend accept that too many NATO Governments and political parties have accepted energy  dependence on Putin and financial dependence on dodgy donations from Russian oligarchs Given that we spent between 4</mark>
7626,"<mark>5% and 5% of GDP on defence throughout the 1980s until the end of the cold war, will he now accept 3% of GDP on defence as a suitable future benchmark</mark>"
7627,"<mark> We must shore up that country, and that is why I announced a further $500 million of support today from the UK Government</mark>"
7628,<mark> I echo his welcoming of Chancellor Scholzs brave decision today to freeze Nord Stream 2</mark>
7629,"<mark> Given the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the fact that we have now entered a new era in the battle for democracy globally, will he now consider a substantial and sustained increase in defence spending, well above the 2</mark>"
7630,"<mark>4% that is required to ensure stability and peace in our time Jawjaw, if indeed there is room for it in future, will be more effective with stronger armed forces</mark>"
7631,"<mark> If the worst happens, a European nation of 44 million men, women and children would become the target of a fullscale war of aggression waged, without a shred of justification, for the absurd and even mystical reasons that Putin described last night</mark>"
7632,<mark> We will now guarantee up to $500 million of Development Bank financing</mark>
7633,"<mark> Gentlemans point about visas, we are stopping tier 1 visas from Russia</mark>"
7634,"<mark> We have put another 1,000 troops on standby, and this country will continue to do what it has always done and receive those who are fleeing in fear of persecution</mark>"
7635,<mark> We should work with our European allies to ensure that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is cancelled</mark>
7636,"<mark> Friend go back to the EU and NATO, in particular, and say that we have to raise our spending budgets to at least 3% to have more planes, more ships and more men to deter Russia and not to wage war, but to prevent one from happening</mark>"

7639,"<mark> Promsvyazbank is a top 10 Russian bank, which services 70% of state contracts signed by the Russian Ministry of Defence, but the measures we have prepared are much tougher still, and we will have absolutely no hesitation in implementing them</mark>"
7640,"<mark> There is a G7 meeting straight after this statement, and we will be holding meetings in NATO, in the P5 and in every forum where it is relevant and possible to bring President Putin to understand the gravity of what he is doing</mark>"
7641,<mark> I also welcome the decision by Chancellor Scholz to suspend Nord Stream 2</mark>
7642,"<mark> In the UK, we are in the fortunate position of having only 3% of our gas coming from Russia, but other European countries have learned that they have much more to do</mark>"
7643,"<mark> By the way, I salute the decision of the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to cancel Nord Stream 2</mark>"
7644,"<mark> Friends point about defence spending, actually we are up at 2</mark>"
7645,<mark>4% of GDPI think that is one of the highest figures in NATOand we are the second biggest contributor and military power in NATO already</mark>
7646,"<mark>We have seen a 10% increase in defence spending in this country, and we will sustain that increase in defence spending</mark>"
7647,"<mark> As he knows, in Poland we have increased our support with another 350 Royal Marines from 45 Commando, and in Estonia we have doubled our presence in Tapa to 2,000</mark>"
7648,"<mark> He asked about support for Ukraine; as I mentioned in the House, we have given £100 millionworth of support particularly for Ukraines energy crisis and also for other economic needs, plus the further $500 million I announced just now</mark>"
7649,"<mark> We must understand that and be prepared for it, which is why we are investing massively in cyberpreparedness, with another £2</mark>"
7650,<mark>6 billion to help fortify our defences</mark>
7651,"<mark>According to expert legal advice I have seen, there are serious flaws in the new sanctions regime it may not affect oligarchs close to Putin who do not hold an official position in a company or who own less than 50% of shares; it is too narrow in defining the individuals it covers; unlike US legislation, it is limited in how we can sanction Russian Government officials; and the definition of Government of Russia excludes the legislative branch, including the Duma</mark>"
7652,"<mark> Can the Minister give us an update on the membership action plan, the prelude to NATO membership When Poland joined in 1999, we were told it was a step too far; when Romania joined NATO in 2004, we were told it was a step too far</mark>"
7653,"<mark>We stand firm in our support for Ukraines NATO membership aspirations, in line with the 2008 Bucharest summit declaration, in which NATO allies agreed that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance</mark>"
7654,"<mark> Will the Minister set out very clearly that the article 5 protection of our NATO allies in the Baltic states stands firm and will be unquestionable, and that Britain will not renege on our enhanced forward presence, which is protecting the Baltic states from any Russian aggression</mark>"
7655,<mark> The UK position on Nord Stream 2 has not changed</mark>
7656,"<mark> We have repeatedly aired our concerns about the construction of Nord Stream 2, which would undermine European security by allowing Russia to tighten its grip on those nations that rely on its gas</mark>"
7657,"<mark> Nord Stream 2 would divert supplies away from Ukraine, and the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine is regarded as a deterrent against further Russian aggression, so it is a vital part of Ukraines national security</mark>"
7658,"<mark> We cracked down on illicit finance through the groundbreaking legislation introduced in 2017, the Criminal Finances Act, and we published our economic crime plan in 2019</mark>"
7659,"<mark> We remain willing to engage in consultations, as provided for under that memorandum, as we did back in March 2014 in Paris after Russias illegal annexation of Crimea</mark>"
7660,"<mark> When Iran was excluded from the SWIFT system in 2012, it required an EU regulation to make SWIFT do that, because SWIFT is incorporated under Belgian law</mark>"
7661,"<mark>We have continually voiced our concerns about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and we will continue to do so</mark>"
7662,<mark> We have heard alreadywe have not had an answerthat the SWIFT payment system and Nord Stream 2 must be on the table</mark>
7663,"<mark> Friend support a strengthening of our £23 million counterdisinformation and development aid package to Ukraine, which can help Ukrainians to discern fact from Russian fiction on social media</mark>"
7664,"<mark> Gentleman for the wisdom and the statesmanship with which he has just spoken On his points, we have put 1,000 troops on standby to help with the humanitarian exodus in the adjacent countries, and we have people in forward presence in the adjacent countries to help UK nationals come out</mark>"
7665,"<mark> Gentleman is absolutely right to raise that appalling possibility, and it is vital that we reaffirm, again, that under article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty, we stand foursquare behind every one of our NATO allies and will come to their defence</mark>"
7666,<mark> We are investing massively in cyberprotectionI think we are putting in another £2</mark>
7667,<mark>6 billion</mark>
7668,"<mark> In the past few years, we have tackled more than 3,000 cyberattacks It is a risk, but a risk, I am afraid, that we must run in the cause of freedom</mark>"
7669,"<mark> The Prime Minister has some very important meetings, and I will be running the statement to 6</mark>"
7670,"<mark> This must include ending Europes collective dependence on Russian oil and gas that has served to empower Putin for too long, so I welcome again Chancellor Scholzs excellent decision to halt the certification of Nord Stream 2</mark>"
7671,"<mark> With around half of Russias trade currently in US dollars and sterling, I am pleased to tell the House that the United States is taking similar measures</mark>"
7672,"<mark> So far today, Russian stocks are down by as much as 45%, wiping $250 billion from their value in the biggest oneday decline on record</mark>"
7673,"<mark> Sberbank, Russias biggest lender, is down by as much as 45% and Gazprom down by as much as 39%, while the rouble has plummeted to record lows against the dollar</mark>"
7674,"<mark> Our undersea cables carry more than 95% of western military, diplomatic, commercial, financial and personal communications, and the consequences of these cables being weaponised is terrifying</mark>"
7675,"<mark>Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland triggered article 4 of the north Atlantic treaty today, and I heard that we will be joining those discussions</mark>"
7676,<mark> That is why on Tuesday I announced the $500 million extra package of development aid on top of the £100 million that we have already given</mark>
7677,"<mark> Today, thousands of Russians are protesting in citiesagainst their domestic lawabout this awful war</mark>"
7678,"<mark> May I ask him to look wider than simply the Russian people, and at all those who are enabling Putins economythose who sit on boards of the businesses that finance him, whether they are former Chancellors of Germany, or former Prime Ministers of France Will he look here, close to home, at those who enable and propagate the propaganda that is used by Putin to undermine his own people and free people everywhere Will he update the Treason Act 1351, so that we can identify those people and call them what they are traitors When the Prime Minister speaks to people around the world, will he   speak with the truth that he can in Russian through the BBC Russian service, and start to broadcast in languages other than Russian into Russia, so that all Russian peoples can know that their oppression does not need to exist and they do not need to side with the tyrant</mark>"
7679,"<mark>As well as being incredibly ruthless, President Putin is incredibly rich, with one assessment saying that his personal wealth is up to $200 billion</mark>"
7680,"<mark> The world must isolate Russia like the rogue state it is, including the statebacked oil giant Rosneft, which is 20% owned by BP</mark>"
7681,"<mark> In this new era, the permissive environment that we created for the Kremlins quartermasters to live, invest and party in London, sometimes with the Prime Minister himself, must now come to an endInterruption</mark>"
7682,<mark> We are lucky in this country in that only 3% of our gas comes from Russia</mark>
7683,<mark>  He has hundreds of billions of foreign currency reserves and a military that has been tested</mark>
7684,"<mark> Around 300 civil service roles have already moved or are moving to the city, in addition to the 2,790 civil servants already based in York</mark>"
7685,"<mark>Yes, and what is so encouraging is that the whole House understands the vital importance of that article 5 guarantee that we make to every one of the 30 members of NATO</mark>"
7686,"<mark> So what steps are the Government taking to prepare for the humanitarian issue Will the 1,000 troops on standby to help with humanitarian assistance now be deployed</mark>"
7687,"<mark>I would like to state, on behalf of the people of Norwich, our solidarity with the people of Ukraine</mark>"
7688,<mark>The US ambassador addressed the UN a few days ago to say that up to 5 million refugees may be coming out of Ukraine and into the rest of Europe</mark>
7689,"<mark> Member for Hastings and Rye SallyAnn Hart, Sky News is reporting that over 1,000 brave soulsRussian soulswere arrested last night across 54 cities while protesting against the shedding of both young Russian and Ukrainian blood, as the Minister has pointed out</mark>"
7690,"<mark> Does Britain support NATOs response force now being activated in full What further contribution will the UK make to reinforcing NATO allies on the eastern flank, and when will the 1,000 UK troops on standby to help with humanitarian assistance be deployed The Minister also mentioned the doubling up of British forces in Estonia</mark>"
7691,<mark> The Antonov2 airfield north of Kyiv was taken by Russian airborne forces as part of the initial assault yesterday morning but was reportedly retaken by the Ukrainian forces overnight</mark>
7692,<mark> They report that 137 Ukrainian service personnel have been killed in action as well as 57 civilians; hundreds more have been injured</mark>
7693,"<mark> Those doubledup force levels will  remain indefinitely and will be augmented by the headquarters of 12 Mechanised Brigade, meaning that the United Kingdom will have an armoured brigade in Estonia, reassuring one of our closest NATO allies</mark>"
7694,"<mark> We need to have our eyes wide open to the reality that in such an event NATO jets would, not just possibly but most certainly probably, come into a combat situation with Russian jets, and the risk of miscalculation, escalation and the triggering of article 5 could not be understated in those circumstances</mark>"
7695,"<mark> As Members will appreciate, in the air domain the risk of miscalculation is greater, because things are happening at Mach 2 and there is no time for political calibration; it is in the hands of pilots who are flying at well over the speed of sound</mark>"
7696,"<mark> I understand exactly why the Ukrainian ambassador is asking for this, but we need to be clear that it could well trigger an article 5 moment and we need to be cleareyed about that reality in considering it</mark>"
7697,"<mark> The 1,000 troops that the right hon</mark>"
7698,<mark> Gentleman asked about when the enhanced forward presence battlegroups will have been doubled up and when the brigade headquarters will be in place</mark>
7699,"<mark> There were some fantastic pictures yesterday of Challenger 2 tanks being loaded on to low loader trucks to be driven north through Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, and into Estonia</mark>"
7700,"<mark> It is a testament not only to the Royal Welsh battlegroup but to the brigade headquarters, 3rd Division and the Field Army that that work has been completed so quickly; we expect them to be complete in Tapa by 1 March</mark>"
7701,"<mark> As I said in response to the initial question about a nofly zone, when things are happening at Mach 2, and where border incursions can last for just seconds, often it is not heads of Government who get to make the decision about whether a trigger on an antiaircraft missile system is pulled</mark>"
7702,"<mark> Lady a disservice, but I understood her question to be whether the 1,000 troops will go into Ukraine, as they went into Kabul in the summer, to facilitate the egress of Ukrainians</mark>"
7703,"<mark> The 1,000 troops who are on standby are there to support Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Poland with the expected humanitarian challenges they will face as people make their way out of Ukraine</mark>"
7704,"<mark> It is absolutely essential that the diplomatic effort, even if it requires a bit of patience, brings with us the whole of the western alliance, because if Putin wants one thing more than the territorial gains in Ukraine, it is to see NATO fracture and article 5 no longer mean anything</mark>"
7705,"<mark> Friend, his constituents and the service people who live in his constituency should be enormously proud of what the members of 12th Brigade, headquartered in Bulford and with many living in Tidworth, are doing in Estonia today</mark>"
7706,"<mark> President Putin wants not just territorial gain, but the fracture of the western alliance and for NATO and article 5 to become meaningless</mark>"
7707,"<mark>I want to voice condemnation of Mr Putin on behalf of the residents of Hastings and Rye, and their support of and prayers for the Ukrainians</mark>"
7708,"<mark> Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup Mr French pointed out, this is an issue that overwhelmingly affects women and girls, with 80% of underage marriages in 2018 being undertaken by girls</mark>"
7709,"<mark>I, too, offer my prayers and support for the people of Ukraine on behalf of my Ynys Mn constituents</mark>"
7710,<mark> This outrage against international law is happening just two and a half flying hours from here</mark>
7711,"<mark> Friend the Member for Wentworth and Dearne John Healey will the 1,000 UK troops that the Minister has placed on standby to help with the humanitarian crisis now urgently be deployed</mark>"
7712,"<mark>I am full of praise for the Government for now being able to sanction 1,000 individuals, but will the Minister confirm two things First, can he confirm that a large number of them can be sanctioned for only 56 days under our rules, because it depends on the Act that we passed yesterday Secondly, can he confirm that we will proceed with many more sanctions The tiny number of people around Putin may not be moved by all of this, but the people who have £750,000 tucked away here as their possible bolthole are terrified of what may happen, and we need to get to them as well</mark>"
7713,"<mark> Friend aware of the £30,000 accepted by the Conservative party from the wife of a Putin ally, Lubov Chernukhin Let us be clear, in answer to the hon</mark>"
7714,"<mark> I do not think we can say that about the Ministry of Defences procurement, which is known across Government to be ineffective and inefficientI need only mention the Ajax armoured vehicle to make the point that billions have been misallocated and spent inefficiently and ineffectively</mark>"
7715,"<mark> Before we start talking about spending more, let us not forget that we are one of the biggest spenders on  armaments in the world, dwarfing Russiawe spend more than Russia every yearand that global spend on armaments is approaching $2</mark>"
7716,"<mark>5 trillion, which is 20 times larger than what we have pledged to spend on the climate crisis, the biggest existential threat facing humanity</mark>"
7717,"<mark> Almost 3 million people have fled, the vast majority of them women and children, with little more than the clothes on their back</mark>"
7718,"<mark> An investigation by openDemocracy in 2019 revealed that, in a decade of austerity, the Conservatives took £130 million in donations and 80% of their 2019 general election funding came  from the elite Leaders Group, with exclusive access granted to group members for a fee of £50,000</mark>"
7719,"<mark> Overseas territories, British tax havens, are responsible for 29% of the £245 billion in global taxes that the world loses to corporate, according to the Tax Justice Network</mark>"
7720,<mark> We know that elites in our own media own 90% of UKwide media and print and it is controlled by just three companies</mark>
7721,"<mark> Russia stands isolated at the United Nations, condemned by more than 140 nations, while thousands show great courage in protesting against this war in Putins increasingly authoritarian police state</mark>"
7722,"<mark> We welcomed the delivery of more than 3,600 NLAW antitank weapons</mark>"
7723,<mark> Sergey Brilev regularly reports on the war in Ukraine for Rossiya 1 and always touts the Russian line</mark>
7724,"<mark> He has a £700,000 flat in Chiswick and a British passport, as well as a Russian one</mark>"
7725,"<mark> Why on earth is he not on the list Vladimir Solovyov, a 58yearold who is also on Rossiya 1, is on the EU list but not on the  UK one</mark>"
7726,"<mark> I do not understand why his close associate Rustem Magdeev is not, and neither is Khayrovs daughter, Elsina Khayrova, who is unemployed but manages to have a £22 million mansion in Surrey, a £10 million art fund and £25 million spent on other properties around the UK</mark>"
7727,"<mark> I simply point out that Nigel Farage received £548,573 from Russia Today in 2018 alonethis is from the Russian state</mark>"
7728,"<mark> I am sure that he would acknowledge, however, that whatever courage it took for him to make that rather unpopular contributionI dare say his contribution was possibly, in some respects, inaccurateit took a lot more moral courage for Maria Ovsyannikova to speak out as she did on Channel 1 Russian TV</mark>"
7729,"<mark> He has been at the heart of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which my hon</mark>"
7730,"<mark> I simply say what I have said all along, which is that if NATO overextends the guarantee of article 5 to the point at which it ceases to be credible that the major NATO countries would fight world war three to defend the country in question, it undermines the credibility of the guarantee as a whole</mark>"
7731,"<mark> After today, we will have designated more than 1,000 individuals and entities under our Russian sanctions regime</mark>"
7732,"<mark> We have led the way with our financial sanctions, targeting 10 Russian banks, and we have hit over £300 billion of Russian bank assets</mark>"
7733,"<mark> We were the first European country to send defensive weapons; we have already donated more than 3,600 next generation light antitank weapons and are now supplying Javelin missiles</mark>"
7734,<mark> I am under no illusion that the incredibly brave defence and sacrifices being made by the Ukrainian people against Russian aggression and barbarism is nothing less than a sacrifice on our behalf</mark>
7735,"<mark>Up until that point, I was 110% with the hon</mark>"
7736,"<mark> Friend the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said yesterday was that £350 was the payment to the host family or household</mark>"
7737,"<mark> We have pledged almost £400 million, which includes the supply of more than 700,000 medical items directly to Ukraine and more than 500 power generators to keep essential facilities such as hospitals running</mark>"
7738,"<mark> The Governments response has been late, halfhearted, partial and discriminatory</mark>"
7739,"<mark> So many of them have opened their hearts and their purses, and now we hear that hundreds  of thousands have even offered to open their homes</mark>"
7740,"<mark> Ukraine faces debt payments of $7 billion this year alone and, so far, there has been no offer of suspension or cancellation of debts</mark>"
7741,"<mark> It is a Government of kleptocrats, representing the interests of the billionaire robber barons, with their palaces and yachts paid for with the wealth stolen from the Russian peopleso solidarity with those antiwar protesters</mark>"
7742,"<mark>The world and all of us across this House have watched in unity the horrors of recent weeks, as Ukrainian civilians and thousands of soldiers have been killed in this predicted and premeditated invasion</mark>"
7743,"<mark>5 million people, mainly women and children, to flee their country and face the prospect of many months of uncertainty in refugee camps across Europe</mark>"
7744,"<mark> Despite the Prime Minister last week offering hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians sanctuary in the UK, the Government were shamefully forced to admit that only 1,000 people have been admitted and given refuge on our shores</mark>"
7745,"<mark> Inexplicably, it was not even made public as tens of thousands of Ukrainians streamed across France in search of safe passage</mark>"
7746,"<mark> It is completely unacceptable that already exhausted people, who have travelled hundreds of miles, women and children, are being asked to jump through multiple arduous and unrealistic hoops, while they wait nervously for weeks to find out whether they will be admitted</mark>"
7747,"<mark> They used the Home Offices existing systems as a starting point, but they are simply not suitable in a period of war with almost 3 million refugees in three weeks</mark>"
7748,"<mark>Nobody could fail to be moved by the images of Ukraine that we have been seeing on our screens for days nowthe destruction, the death and the millions of refugees</mark>"
7749,"<mark> None of us can know how long this conflict will last, but we do know that there is already a severe refugee crisis with the potential of literally millions of victims</mark>"
7750,"<mark> The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says that there are still more than 9 million Iraqi refugees worldwide, yet there are currently only 20,000 in this country</mark>"
7751,"<mark> According to him, its breakup was the greatest disaster of the 20th centurya revealing and curious choice when compared with the millions killed in two world wars, in the Russian civil war and in the forced collectivisations, the mass deportations and the hell of the Soviet gulag</mark>"
7752,"<mark>5 million refugees have fled Ukraine, with the United Nations estimating that the number will double by the end of this week, and what have this Government actually succeeded in doing They have created barrier after barrier and piled confusion on top of misery, using excuse after excuse and exploring any possible way in which they could avoid playing their full part in this European humanitarian crisis</mark>"
7753,<mark> The UK sold £15 billionworth of weapons to Saudi Arabia last yearthe very same weapons that are now being used to terrorise the Yemeni peopleand Britishmade bombs rain down on Palestine</mark>
7754,"<mark>We tend to forget Moldova, but it is always worth remembering that the poorest country in Europe has taken in a quarter of a million refugees</mark>"
7755,<mark> A quarter of a million Does not that make it doubly shameful that what we are told is one of the wealthiest countries in the world has so far done so little</mark>
7756,"<mark> One hundred years ago, when Russia wanted to impose its will on the Ukrainian people, it enforced famine on Ukraine</mark>"
7757,<mark> It is in multimillion pound properties scattered across the City of London</mark>
7758,"<mark>With the leave of the House, I would like to conclude this debate on behalf of my hon</mark>"
7759,"<mark> With the addition of 360 people sanctioned today, the United Kingdom has now taken action against over 1,000 Russian individuals and entities</mark>"
7760,<mark> Bank assets worth over £350 billion have been frozen</mark>
7761,"<mark> The artists, athletes and performers blocked from performing overseas and the hundreds of people queuing in recent days for their last McDonalds must be dismal signals to all Russians that Putin is damaging their country</mark>"
7762,<mark> It is the oppression of the freedom of hundreds of thousands of innocent people to feed the ego of one man</mark>
7763,"<mark> It is imperative that we all bear in mind that this is not about the millions of ordinary Russian citizens, both those still in Russia and those here in the UK</mark>"
7764,<mark> The Polish community in this country is now almost 1 million strong</mark>
7765,<mark> Poland has taken in more than 1</mark>
7766,"<mark>5 million Ukrainian refugees, and the figure is rising all the time</mark>"
7767,"<mark> That is why it is essential for Britain to take a lead in creating a Marshall plan to help countries such as Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova, which between them have taken more than 95% of all Ukrainian refugees</mark>"
7768,"<mark> Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania have the comfort of being NATO partners, so we know we stand by them under article 5if the Russians cross that fence, both sides know what the ramifications will be for both sidesbut Moldova does not have that protection</mark>"
7769,"<mark> The suffering of the Ukrainian people, of the Georgian people and of others, including Russians demonstrating on behalf of us all, must not go unrecognised</mark>"
7770,"<mark> The Disasters Emergency Committees appeal has now reached over £150 million, which we are supporting with our largest ever matchfunding pledge of £25 million</mark>"
7771,"<mark> At that time, natural gas exports from Russia to Germany amounted to 35% of Germanys annual consumption</mark>"
7772,"<mark> Nord Stream 2 let alone Nord Stream 1bypasses Ukraine, so it remains one of the greatest strategic mistakes of our time, conceived all of 20 years ago or more</mark>"
7773,"<mark> As I speak, Germany still depends on Russian oil and gas and Nord Stream 2 has only been paused, not yet completely abandoned</mark>"
7774,"<mark> Levelling cities, forcing women and children in their millions to flee, lying and lying while watching ones own country and its citizens become impoverishedthat is not insanity; it is evil</mark>"
7775,"<mark> This month marks eight years since  the beginning of the Saudiled war on Yemen, which has claimed more than a quarter of a million lives and pushed 20 million people to the brink of starvation</mark>"
7776,"<mark> As experts have made clear, that war would not be possible without the Governments support and the £20 billionworth of arms that they have sold to the Saudi regime since it began</mark>"
7777,"<mark> A huge percentage of the Russian population will still be with Putinwill believe what he is putting outbut hopefully the slow drip, drip, drip of resistance will eventually reach a  tipping point, and the grey suits in the Kremlin will tap him up and suggest, Time to go</mark>"
7778,"<mark> They gave Ukraine the means to fight  back, and the training to help it, and some percentage of the success is down to what the Ministry of Defence in this country did to help our Ukrainian friends</mark>"
7779,"<mark> Member for Haltemprice and Howden Mr Davis observed, that is £1 billion of assets that have left the United Kingdom</mark>"
7780,"<mark> She has paid over 1,000 for visas, including for Valeria, an unaccompanied minor who turned 11 years old yesterday</mark>"
7781,<mark> I am offended on behalf of my constituents that they are struggling with the system</mark>
7782,"<mark> Make no mistake, Ukrainians are fighting this war on behalf of all of us who are part of the free and democratic world</mark>"
7783,<mark> It is important that people recognise that the £350 some hon</mark>
7784,"<mark> Members have mentioned will go to the householder, but more than £10,000 of support will be made available to local councils for those being homed in the UK</mark>"
7785,"<mark> Friend the Defence Secretary two weeks ago, there was a commitment of 4,241 nextgeneration light antitank weaponsNLAWSwhich have been delivered</mark>"
7786,"<mark> In Syria, 5 million people were internally displaced and 5 million people were outside in the surrounding countriesthat is 10 million people out of a population of 20 million</mark>"
7787,"<mark> Sanctioning leads to asset freezes, so the Government will be left holding millions of poundsworth of houses, boats and other assets, but what happens next Will these assets be sequestrated and used for the benefit of Ukraines rebuilding, or will they be held to be returned to oligarchs after the war The latter option may not be so popular, but it might be legally correct if we do not legislate further on this matter</mark>"

7792,"<mark>Do we not need an update of the Treason Act A treason charge can be laid only in relation to the person of the monarch, and this Act from 1351 really does need updating</mark>"
7793,<mark> We should be working to support our allies in the EU to cancel Nord Stream 2</mark>
7794,"<mark> We did not sanction Russias oil and gas supplies, which make up 70% of its exports</mark>"
7795,"<mark> However, we should not forget that no gas is travelling down Nord Stream 2 now and that all the gas comes into Germany on Nord Stream 1</mark>"

7797,"<mark> Although we do not want to do anything that would cause systemic risk to UK financial markets, we are talking in the billions of dollars here rather than in the trillions, and there are other ways of shoring up our system to prevent that happening</mark>"
7798,"<mark> I am told that Putin has squirrelled away more than $250 billion around the world through his oligarchs; they are not actually wealthy individuals, but only nominally wealthy, because it is his money, which he has stolen from the Russian state</mark>"
7799,"<mark> Last week, ITVs Peston show explained that £1</mark>"
7800,"<mark>5 billion of property in the UK has been bought by Russians accused of corruption or with Kremlin links, and nearly 30% of that is in Westminster</mark>"

7802,"<mark> I am going to be a bit repetitive here, because it needs to be said again and again where is the economic crimes Bill Where is the reform to beneficial intereststrue ownership for offshore properties For heavens sake, is it really in our national interest to have tens of thousands of properties used and owned by offshore shell trusts, hiding organised crime or the worlds kleptocrats If the Government understand hybrid conflict, what are they doing to deal with this threat</mark>"
7803,<mark> The analysis of the Royal United Services Institute is that 60% of the measures in the plan have not been implemented</mark>
7804,<mark> It is a task we perform with our allies for the benefit of billions of people around the worldto take on the kleptosphere in new and aggressive ways</mark>
7805,<mark> Friend the Foreign Secretary announced that we will be increasing our support to Ukraine by £100 million</mark>
7806,"<mark> As has been mentioned, £1</mark>"
7807,<mark>5 billionworth of property in the UK is owned by Russians who are connected to crime and corruption</mark>
7808,"<mark> Some 50% of that is registered in overseas territories and Crown dependencies, the public registers of which are not supposed to go live until 2023</mark>"
7809,"<mark> The Prime Minister himself said in his statement that, in a worstcase scenario, 44 million people could get pulled into a very aggressive war, which would mean a refugee crisis</mark>"
7810,"<mark> Banks in Germany, Denmark and Sweden all laundered billions of pounds from Russia but they used UK shell companies to do so</mark>"
7811,<mark> Some £1</mark>
7812,"<mark>5 billion of UK property has been bought with suspicious Russian wealth, according to Transparency International, and that is just the tip of the iceberg</mark>"
7813,"<mark> I do of course welcome the sanctions announced today, but Germanys first tranche of sanctions was Nord Stream 2</mark>"
7814,"<mark> Up to this point, for the last two weeks, the narrative was about how we had done more than Germany, but this is round one in the boxing match Germany has brought Nord Stream 2, and we have brought five banks that do not really matter and three people whom the United States had already sanctioned</mark>"
7815,"<mark> They must be a precursor to decisive action taken with our allies, because it is clear that Russian aggression will not dissolve in the face of what will equate to a parking fine for a millionaireirritating, but in no way lifechanging</mark>"
7816,"<mark> Upon that acceptance, NATO troops could carry out NATO manoeuvres in Ukraine, support our allies against the aggression of Russia and protect the 44 million Ukrainians</mark>"
7817,"<mark> I agree that the Germans have moved swiftly, as we know, to suspend Nord Stream 2I would like to see them end the whole idea of itbut if they are going to do more, we should be cooperating with them and going in hard ourselves this one time</mark>"
7818,"<mark> Mr Putin has proven to be considerably better at salami slicing than we are, so now is not the time for half measures</mark>"
7819,"<mark> It is not nothing, but it is not much, particularly when set against the actions of the German Government in announcing the icingthe cancellation perhaps, but the icing certainlyof the Nord Stream 2 project, a $10 billion project, which has huge implications for their energy security, and indeed ours, given the interconnectedness of the EU and the European energy markets</mark>"
7820,<mark> New legislation is unlikely to affect oligarchs close to Putin who do not hold an official position in a company and who own less than 50% of the shares</mark>
7821,<mark> It is not a time for halfmeasures or naivety as to President Putins intentions</mark>
7822,"<mark> In this city of more than 7 million people, with at least a quarter of a million properties owned in London by foreign nationals, just three individuals have been named, when the EU has already indicated the naming of 27</mark>"
7823,"<mark> We need to understand what these tier 1 visas did, and where the vulnerabilities are in the British economy</mark>"
7824,"<mark> As it stands, paragraph 4 of the legislation would allow sanctions to be laid against individuals on the board of companies with certain links to the Russian Government but it would not enable sanctions to be laid against officials who enable the Russian Government to pursue their policy of aggression in Ukraine</mark>"
7825,"<mark> Paragraph 7 of the legislation defines what is meant by the Government of Russia, but it does not include members of Russias legislative branch, the Federal Assembly</mark>"
7826,"<mark> 2 Regulations 2021 SI, 2021, No</mark>"

7829,<mark> Friend is 100% right</mark>
7830,"<mark>I welcome the sanctions that the Foreign Secretary has set out and her words about getting Putins dirty money out of UK finance, but can we also get it out of UK politics Would she support the Conservative partys handing back its £2 million from Russian oligarchs</mark>"
7831,"<mark> Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber Ian Blackford has also raised the question of the £2</mark>"
7832,<mark>3 million of donations</mark>
7833,<mark> The rouble has fallen by more than 40% as a result</mark>
7834,"<mark> As much as $250 billion has been wiped off the Russian stock market and, today, its stock market is closed</mark>"
7835,"<mark> The EU, Germany, Sweden and others are following our lead in providing defensive weapons to Ukraine, and Germany has frozen Nord Stream 2</mark>"
7836,"<mark> Friend the Prime Minister announced a further £40 million of  humanitarian aid, which will provide Ukrainians with access to basic necessities and vital medical supplies</mark>"
7837,"<mark> The UK is also supporting Ukraines economy, including through £100 million of official development assistance and guarantees of up to $500 million in development bank loans</mark>"
7838,"<mark> With over 50% of Russian trade denominated in dollars or sterling, our coordinated action with the United States will damage Russias ability to trade with the world, and as soon as this legislation comes into force, we will apply it to SberbankRussias largest bank</mark>"
7839,"<mark> The same legislation will prevent the Russian state from raising debt here, and will isolate all Russian companiesmore than 3 million businessesfrom accessing UK capital markets</mark>"
7840,<mark> I am pleased to see Germany committing 2% of its GDP to NATO</mark>
7841,"<mark> The rouble has crashed by over 40%, the main borrowing rate is up 20%, and inflation is reportedly hitting about 65% per year</mark>"
7842,<mark> Oligarchs are being frozen out of their bank accounts and the central bank of Russia is being blocked from part of the $640 billion war chest that it holds in foreign reserves</mark>
7843,"<mark> We should remind everyone that the oligarchs are mostly in possession of Putins own personal fortune, which is in the order of $200 billion to $250 billion, squirrelled away through their accounts</mark>"
7844,<mark>We are already donating £40 million of additional humanitarian assistance to Ukraine</mark>
7845,"<mark> This war is not on behalf of the Russian people; this war has been instigated by President Putin, and it is very important that we focus on the personal agency that he has had in mounting this unprovoked attack on Ukraine</mark>"
7846,"<mark> Together with the G7, we represent half the global economy, and that is what will really shift Putins behaviour</mark>"
7847,<mark> The NS Challenger is due to berth at 6 am on Wednesday</mark>
7848,<mark> The UK gets only 3% of its energy from Russian oil and gas</mark>
7849,"<mark> The figure for some countries is as high as 90% or 100%; we have to reduce that over time, and that is what we are working on through the G7</mark>"
7850,"<mark>This sanctions package has been agreed across the G7, which represents more than 50% of the global economy</mark>"
7851,"<mark> Surely we should at least be cutting the Russian embassy here by a half or three quarters, if not deciding that the ambassador, who has lied through his teeth to this House, should go back home</mark>"
7852,"<mark> On the specifics of the Foreign Secretarys statement, she said that over 50% of Russian trade is denominated in dollars or sterling, but so that the House can understand the impact of our Governments actions, how much of Russian trade is denominated in sterling</mark>"

7854,"<mark> The point that I was making is that the action that we have taken on clearing is in conjunction with the United States, so between us we are able to cover 50% of that trade</mark>"

7935,"<mark> Since 2013, according to Reporters Without Borders, press freedom has been in decline</mark>"
7936,"<mark> Five thousand refugees this year is not commensurate with the scenes in Kabul of people literally running for their lives and clinging to aircraft, and a hazy figure of 20,000, over what period we are not certain, is insubstantial to say the least, given the circumstances</mark>"
7937,"<mark>Can I just make some progress The combat phase of our mission ended in 2014, when we brought the vast majority of our troops home and handed over responsibility for security to the Afghans themselves, and we continued to support their efforts</mark>"
7938,"<mark> As for our NATO allies and allies around the  world, when it came for us to look at the options that this country might have in view of the American decision to withdraw, we came up against this hard reality that since 2009, America has deployed 98% of all weapons released from NATO aircraft in Afghanistan and, at the peak of the operation, when there were 132,000 troops on the ground, 90,000 of them were American</mark>"
7939,<mark> That idea ended with the combat mission in 2014</mark>
7940,"<mark> I do not believe that today deploying tens of thousands of British troops to fight the Taliban is an option that, no matter how sincerely people may advocate itand I appreciate their sinceritywould commend itself either to the British people or to this House</mark>"
7941,"<mark> Of course, there are tens of thousands of others who are under sentence of death and fear for their lives</mark>"
7942,"<mark> In addition to those Afghans with whom we have worked directly, I can announce today that we are committing to relocating another 5,000 Afghans this year, with a new and bespoke resettlement scheme focusing on the most vulnerable, particularly women and children</mark>"

7950,"<mark> Does he recognise that, according to organisations such as Safe Passage, 70% of the unaccompanied minors crossing the channel come from Afghanistan, and to criminalise them is a criminal act in itself</mark>"
7951,"<mark> Since 2001, the UK Government have spent around £27</mark>"

7956,"<mark> I know that the whole House, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary will express publicly our solidarity with and admiration for Afghan women MPs, who, as parliamentary pioneershaving stepped forward into public life to make a reality of democracy for that half of the population of Afghanistan who are women and girlsare now, in the face of such an uncertain future, determined to protect and defend those rights</mark>"

7961,"<mark>I do not often mention my brother Jonathan, who was killed by an alQaeda affiliate in Bali in 2002</mark>"
7962,<mark> We denied the Taliban a seat at the table back in 2001</mark>
7963,"<mark> Secondly, we did not start training the Afghan forces until 2005, by which time the Taliban were already on the advance</mark>"
7964,"<mark> We do not spend £40 billion a year on a tier 1 military for it to be unable to go out the door without the Americans, and the taxpayer does not expect that</mark>"
7965,"<mark> He knows that the Office for Veterans Affairs is nothing like it was designed to be the paltry £5 million funding was slashed after less than a year, there was a lack of staff, and there was not even an office from which to work</mark>"
7966,<mark>The visions on television sets the other day very much were redolent of 1975</mark>
7967,"<mark> We think of the Royal Anglian Regiment, whose members were awarded the freedom to enter the borough of Charnwood in 2006, in recognition of their service to our country and our town</mark>"
7968,"<mark> That is demonstrated by the fact that today millions of girls in Afghanistan go to school and women hold more than a quarter of the seats in Afghanistans parliament, in stark contrast with the situation under the previous Talibanruled Afghanistan in which no girls attended school and women were excluded from governance</mark>"
7969,<mark> Those same forces have enabled development to take place that has improved the lives of millions and transformed Afghan society</mark>
7970,"<mark>Four hundred and fiftyseven UK service personnel, in excess of 3,000 coalition forces, nearly 70,000 Afghan Government troops and police, aid workers, journalists, humanitarians and tens of thousands of Afghan civilians have been killed over the past two decades</mark>"
7971,"<mark> Many, many thousands more have been injured or brutalised</mark>"
7972,"<mark> In the World Trade Centre, 2,600 died; 125 died in the Pentagon; and 256 died on the planes</mark>"
7973,"<mark> We did not heed the warnings in 2018, when 115 died in suicide attacks in Kabul</mark>"
7974,"<mark>Watching the scenes at Kabul airport this week left me and many others with feelings of overwhelming grief and anger grief for the millions of Afghan women and girls in particular who were promised a brighter future and the opportunity to learn, work and pursue their dreams; and anger that the many pledges made to the Afghan people over the past 20 years have been broken as they were abandoned to their fate</mark>"
7975,"<mark> For all the hand wringing of Government Ministers in the last few days, the reality is that their actions over the past few months have left thousands of ordinary Afghans in terrible danger</mark>"
7976,"<mark> When the Government are already failing to achieve their existing target of settling 5,000 refugees a year, we need to hear an awful lot more about how  Ministers are planning to deliver for Afghan refugees and guarantees that local government will be properly funded to work with them</mark>"
7977,"<mark> The debacle in Afghanistan, with the loss of almost a quarter of a million lives, is just one of four failed conflicts in the past 20 years</mark>"
7978,"<mark> Under the Taliban, 5,000 of our most committed, vicious and determined enemies are out there once again, and they will seek their moment</mark>"
7979,"<mark> The removal of 2,500 American troops, along with 8,000 coalition troops and 18,000 of those in support, brought about a catastrophic drop in morale among both the Afghan forces and the Afghan Government</mark>"
7980,"<mark>Like others, I have been to Afghanistannot as a solder, but as a 16yearold teenager in 1978</mark>"
7981,"<mark> We have seen 40% of girls in education9 million girls where there were nonewith literacy rates of 56% and 70,000 female teachers</mark>"
7982,"<mark> Four thousand midwives have been trained, up from 400 in 2001, and female MPs make up 28% of Parliamentwe only make up 34% here, so they were doing incredibly well</mark>"
7983,"<mark> He could have carried on with 4,500 American troops and sophisticated air support</mark>"
7984,"<mark> I am very proud to represent the 1 Royal Irish Regiment, based in Tern Hill in my constituency</mark>"
7985,"<mark> We can all help the Government can help through the NHS, the MOD contributes 25% of its funds, and every one of usevery constituentcan help Combat Stress now</mark>"
7986,<mark>I am sure I speak on behalf of everyone in passing on condolences to the Member who has just spoken</mark>
7987,"<mark> Are we really going to separate them Or there is the man who has been trying to get his wife out since 2018 but, because of covid, her visa was delayed</mark>"
7988,"<mark> With our allies in the EU and Commonwealth, we must ensure that aid reaches those in needand this is after the Government cut the UK contribution to the Afghanistan humanitarian response plan by 76%</mark>"
7989,"<mark> We have heard a lot today about the importance of education for millions of girls, about the value of the freedom that allowed women to work, about the political representation, the elections and the diversity of representation that would have been unthinkable under the Taliban, and much more</mark>"
7990,"<mark> Many thousands will now be attempting to flee the Taliban, who have swiftly seized power after the withdrawal of US troops</mark>"
7991,"<mark> It was large, but for between 5,000 and 20,000 troops, contractors, special forces and so on who were there, it was smaller than many NATOUS bases and missions around the world</mark>"
7992,"<mark> He has chosen not to and has opened the United States, Europe, India and many allies throughout the world to considerable terrorist risks from the 2,500 to 4,000 jihadi nut jobspardon my Frenchwho are currently being released from Bagram, Kandahar and Kabul</mark>"
7993,<mark> It remains the case that the UK Government have a practical and moral responsibility to thousands upon thousands of people in Afghanistan</mark>
7994,"<mark> None the less, the 5,000 cap this year is arbitrary and insufficient</mark>"
7995,"<mark> But, as others have said, much was achieved Afghanistan ceased to be a safe haven for terrorist groups; the lives of women and girls, particularly in the cities, were transformed; as we have heard, millions of girls have been to school to receive an education that cannot be unlearned; and women were able to work and to take part in government at regional and national levels</mark>"
7996,"<mark> We are watching the takeover of a nation that, over 20 years, has made great progress, particularly for millions of women and girlsprogress that came through sacrifices by many brave members of the Afghan forces and our own, as well as those who served in civil ranks</mark>"
7997,"<mark> We lost a good friend seven years ago, when Del Singh was killed in a horrific attack by the Taliban at a restaurant in Kabul; he was one of many thousands who have made the ultimate sacrifice to help to bring about peace, stability and nationhoodI repeat nationhood, which was also part of our responsibility as an international community</mark>"
7998,<mark> 1117</mark>
7999,<mark> We have provided over £3</mark>
8000,"<mark>3 billion of aid since 2001, with notable improvements in the participation of girls in education and political representation for women</mark>"
8001,"<mark> The Home Office is working hard with international partners on getting as many of these people as it can out safely, and I was glad to hear, as of Monday evening, that over 3,300 Afghan staff and their families have already been evacuated</mark>"
8002,<mark> Shout it from the rooftops Four hundred and fiftyseven men and women demand it; their families demand it; and hundreds and thousands of our countrymen and countrywomen who are damaged in mind and body demand it</mark>
8003,<mark> Four hundred and fiftyseven British dead demand it</mark>
8004,<mark> I was working in the MOD in 2001 just before military operations in Afghanistan got under way</mark>
8005,<mark> I served on Op Herrick 9 in the autumn and winter of 200809</mark>
8006,<mark> My time with 3 Commando Brigade was one of the great privileges of my life</mark>
8007,"<mark> We must do all we can to assist those Afghan people who supported the British effort and who are now at risk of retribution, namely the thousands of interpreters still waiting to leave</mark>"
8008,"<mark> Two thousand, two hundred were physically wounded, and countless are left with mental scars</mark>"
8009,"<mark> Does  he share my concern about the fact that the Taliban are the worlds biggest drug cartel, producing 85% of the worlds heroin, which is something that will have an impact on our communities, as production is set to soar under their control</mark>"
8010,"<mark> This was a NATO mission, which began as an article 5 request when the United States suffered a terrorist Pearl Harbor on 911</mark>"
8011,"<mark> The reality is that it is 20 years of foreign policy failure, with 457 British soldiers killed and a quarter of a million deaths overall, including more than 70,000 civilians</mark>"
8012,"<mark> Then we have the wounded, the impoverished and the millions of refugees</mark>"
8013,<mark> Its Pumas have served in Afghanistan since 2015</mark>
8014,<mark>I was able to visit Afghanistan in November 2011 as a member of the valuable armed forces parliamentary scheme</mark>
8015,<mark> In 2011 there was great confidence that Afghan forces would be able to take over once we had left</mark>
8016,"<mark> I want to start by stating a hard but clear truth that some in this House do not want to hear the 20year war on Afghanistan was a mistake of catastrophic proportions, causing untold human tragedy, with 240,000 people killedmen, women and childrenincluding tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians and 457 British personnel</mark>"
8017,"<mark> That hope came because of the hard work and sacrifices of our armed forces, our allies and the thousands and thousands of Afghansin their armed forces, as well as the interpreterswho worked with us</mark>"
8018,"<mark> Tens of thousands of UK personnel all have their own memories of the conflict, good and bad, and our message to them all should be that we are incredibly proud of what they did</mark>"
8019,"<mark> Members have given voice to something that tens of thousands of families in Britain are feelingour friends, neighbours and constituents who served, lost loved ones or suffered lifechanging injuries, and are wondering now what it was all for</mark>"
8020,<mark> Can we be honest It is not honest to claim to be doubling aid to Afghanistan when just a few months ago it was cut by half</mark>
8021,"<mark> Hundreds of thousands of people are crossing the border, but the Prime Minister did not once mention what relationship he has with Pakistan, what work he is doing with it, what support he will give it, or how he will speak to it about what to do</mark>"
8022,"<mark> In response, NATO invoked article 5 of its treaty for the first and only time in its history, and the United Kingdom, among others, joined America in going into Afghanistan on a mission to extirpate alQaeda in that country, and to do whatever we could to stabilise Afghanistan, in spite of all the difficulties and challenges we knew that we would face</mark>"
8023,"<mark> Lady, because I think that she has asked a question that has formed in many peoples minds about the 5,000</mark>"
8024,"<mark> Yes, indeed, the 5,000 extra in the resettlement scheme are additional to those already announced</mark>"
8025,<mark> We will also support the wider international community delivering humanitarian projects in the region by doubling the amount of humanitarian and development assistance that we had previously committed to Afghanistan this year with new fundingInterruptionwait for ittaking this up to £286 million with immediate effect</mark>
8026,"<mark> Even amid the heartwrenching scenes we see today, I believe they should be proud of their achievements, and we should be deeply proud of them, because they conferred benefits that are lasting and ineradicable on millions of people in one of the poorest countries on earth, and they provided vital protection for two decades to this country and the rest of the world</mark>"
8027,"<mark> Since the most recent conflict began, in 2001, the Home Office has rejected asylum for 32,000 Afghans, including 875 girls</mark>"
8028,"<mark> The total number of Afghans in the system stands at 3,117, so if we are to have any confidence that this is a turning point, this UK Government need to rethink radically how they respond to the refugee crisis unfolding before our eyes</mark>"
8029,<mark> Scotland took 15% of the refugees who came from Syria</mark>
8030,<mark> It has cost the lives of tens of thousands of Afghan people</mark>
8031,<mark> She wants to help the thousands of women activists and others who have supported us over the past 20 years</mark>
8032,<mark> Pakistan already has 3 million Afghan refugees</mark>
8033,"<mark> It is also our opportunity to show the world the reality of the words in chapter 2 of our new immigration planto ensure support for those, such as persecuted Christians, who need emergency resettlement</mark>"
8034,<mark> We heard from the Prime Minister that 98% of all the equipment on the ground in Afghanistan came from the United States of America</mark>
8035,"<mark>In 2007, the then Labour Government sent a small crossparty group of Members of Parliament to Afghanistan, and I was one of them</mark>"
8036,"<mark> Whereas 20 years ago, almost no girls went to school and women were banned from positions of governance, now 3</mark>"
8037,<mark>6 million girls have been in school this year alone and women hold over a quarter of the seats in the Afghan Parliament</mark>
8038,"<mark> The Prime Minister confirmed to me earlier that the pledge to help 5,000 people this year is in addition to the commitment made in 2019 to resettle 5,000 people a year from across the world, not instead of it</mark>"
8039,"<mark> The fundamental error that we made hereit has been alluded to in one or two very good speechesis that we allowed the initial, limited and very successful mission of expelling alQaeda in 2001 to morph into a much wider intervention of nation building, which meant fighting the Taliban</mark>"
8040,"<mark> That was unnecessary, given that the 2001 intervention had proved that we could achieve our goals of combating terrorism through limited interventions</mark>"
8041,"<mark> I also pay particular tribute to the 3,487 allied service personnel who lost their lives, including 457 British men and women, many of whom I served with</mark>"
8042,<mark> He believed in our mission to rebuild Afghanistan after half a century of bloodshed</mark>
8043,"<mark> To date, we have resettled over 3,300 Afghan staff and their families, including 2,000 since April</mark>"
8044,"<mark>Considering that the Government promised in 2016 to save 3,000 unaccompanied refugee children from Calais, is the right hon</mark>"
8045,"<mark> The clear question to be asked is, was it all worth it I first visited Afghanistan in 2003, and up until 2010 I visited on six occasions</mark>"
8046,<mark> It is also the debt we have to those who lost their lives and those who sacrificed so much on our behalf</mark>
8047,"<mark>As I said in the House just a few weeks ago, there was an extensive defence review about the Afghan mission after the combat mission ended in 2014, and I believe that most of the key questions have already been extensively gone into</mark>"
8048,"<mark>The Home Secretary announced this morning that the UK will take 20,000 refugees from Afghanistan but that only 5,000 will be able to come this year</mark>"
8049,"<mark> The Home Secretary announced in 2019 that the UK would continue a resettlement scheme of 5,000 refugees a year after the Syrian scheme closed</mark>"
8050,"<mark> Can the Prime Minister confirm that the announcement today of an Afghan resettlement scheme is in addition to that existing 5,000 resettlement commitment, as opposed to simply being a refocusing or displacement of that existing 5,000ayear resettlement programme</mark>"
8051,"<mark> The process was designed to help 7,000 people, yet Home Office figures this week showed that only 2,000 have been helped so far</mark>"
8052,"<mark> That is why the question arises as to what is behind the 5,000 number, and why others are having to wait so long</mark>"
8053,"<mark>I was elected to the House in 2001, which was the year of the NATO intervention in Afghanistan</mark>"
8054,"<mark> Let us not forget that one of the first actions of the Taliban was to release thousands of prisoners, many of whom were terrorists</mark>"
8055,"<mark> I say that because already we can see widespread atrocities in Afghanistan outside Kabul, we can see thousands of Afghans who understand what the Taliban are all about desperate to leave their country, and we must recognise that the Taliban are a diverse group; many of them outside Kabul are very different from the PRslick Taliban leaders we see on our television screens</mark>"
8056,"<mark> I am not hopeful and, more importantly, neither are those thousands of people trying to flee</mark>"
8057,"<mark> Just over a quarter of the democratically elected MPs in Afghanistans House of the People were women, but it appears that no women at all are now represented by the new allmale regime</mark>"
8058,"<mark> He has not left the house in weeks, not because of covid, but because of fearalreadyof being killed, and he is one of millions</mark>"
8059,"<mark> If we take the 5,000 and break it down by constituency, that is seven per constituency</mark>"
8060,<mark> Twenty thousand refugees over five years is simply not good enough</mark>
8061,"<mark> Member for Lincoln Karl McCartney, the Minister will know that hundreds of people, including men who I served alongside, remain stranded in Afghanistan</mark>"
8062,"<mark> Between April and 18 October, we disbursed nearly £35 million of lifesaving humanitarian support to Afghanistan</mark>"
8063,"<mark>Before the Taliban took control, more than 3</mark>"
8064,"<mark>5 million girls were in school, and many more were in university and vital roles across the Afghan economy</mark>"
8065,"<mark> Taliban spokesmen say that girls can go to school, yet in many areas they are permitted only up to grade 6 or 7, and in some areas they are not permitted at all</mark>"
8066,"<mark> This year, we are doubling our humanitarian and development assistance to Afghanistan to £286 million, including for women and girls</mark>"
8067,"<mark>The motto of Englands smallest county, Rutland, is multum in parvomuch in littleand never has that been more true than in the last two weeks, with the greatest Roman discovery in 200 years and the discovery of an ichthyosaur, the greatest fossil discovery in 100 years</mark>"
8068,<mark> 1 is to vote out those dozy Labour councillors</mark>
8069,"<mark> 1 George Street and celebrate great British farming today, can we have public procurement that uses British food, and can we have food envoys all across the world promoting our great British food and farming</mark>"
8070,"<mark> We are proud under Operation Pitting to have already evacuated 15,000 people from Afghanistan</mark>"
8071,<mark> We have allocated £286 million in assistance for people in Afghanistan and we are continuing to offer safe passage to this country from Afghanistan</mark>
8072,<mark>£56 million through the levelling up fund and £40 million through transforming citiesthat is just some of the investment that we have recently secured for StokeonTrent</mark>
8073,"<mark> Between 12% and 15% of the workforce are away isolating, and 140 bedsabout 20% of the totalare blocked because the hospital cannot get people back out into social care in the community</mark>"
8074,"<mark> Despite the pandemic, 85% of patients in England wait only two weeks for their urgent suspected cancer referrals</mark>"
8075,<mark> I point out that the Welsh Government will benefit from an additional £3</mark>
8076,"<mark>8 billion of funding this year, plus a further £270 million to support the response to covid</mark>"
8077,"<mark> We have had more than 150,000 deaths from covid over the past couple of years, and we have seen standards in public life trashed</mark>"
8078,"<mark>I recently visited my local jobcentre, and I am pleased to announce that the adult claimant count is down 28%, and the young adult claimant count is down 40%</mark>"
8079,"<mark> Will the Prime Minister join me in thanking Stourbridge jobcentre for all its hard work, and for its dedication in achieving those results and contributing to the jobs revival that is happening across the west midlands, with 61,000 new jobs since March 2021</mark>"
8080,<mark> I know that millions of people across this country have made extraordinary sacrifices over the last 18 months</mark>
8081,"<mark> 10 is a big department, with the garden as an extension of the office, which has been in constant use because of the role of fresh air in stopping the virus</mark>"
8082,"<mark> When I went into that garden just after 6 oclock on 20 May 2020, to thank groups of staff before going back into my office 25 minutes later to continue working, I believed implicitly that this was a work event, but with hindsight, I should have sent everyone back inside</mark>"
8083,"<mark> I should have found some other way to thank them, and I should have recognised that even if it could be said technically to fall within the guidance, there would be millions and millions of people who simply would not see it that waypeople who suffered terribly, people who were forbidden from meeting  loved ones at all, inside or outsideand to them, and to this House, I offer my heartfelt apologies</mark>"
8084,"<mark> 10 and across the Government, but I want to reassure the people of this country, including Hannah and her family, that we have been working to do everything we can to protect her and her family</mark>"

8087,"<mark> It is notable that the Opposition do not like to dwell on these points, but it is an astonishing fact   that we have 420,000 more people in work now than before the pandemic began, and youth unemployment is at a record low</mark>"
8088,<mark> Figures released just last night show that 79% of people in Scotland think the Prime Minister should step down</mark>
8089,<mark> I knew him first in the early 70s and worked with him on the Grunwick strike</mark>
8090,"<mark> Given that pedigree, its excellent transport links and the need to level up the south, does he agree that Eastleigh would make the perfect home for the new headquarters of Great British Railways</mark>"
8091,"<mark> As I told the House earlier, further details of the competition to identify the new Great British Railways headquarters will be announced in the coming weeks</mark>"
8092,"<mark>Hundreds of respondents took part in the StokeonTrent North, Kidsgrove and Talke Bus Back Better survey, in which 80% said they would use the bus more if services were improved</mark>"
8093,"<mark> The Conservativeled StokeonTrent City Council has submitted a fantastic Bus Back Better bid for £90 million to improve our infrastructure and our services, so will the Prime Minister make our day in StokeonTrent and announce that that money is coming soon</mark>"
8094,<mark> Hannah Bradys father Shaun was just 55 when he lost his life to covid</mark>
8095,"<mark>In my Stockport constituency, the average rent for a twobedroom property is an unaffordable £800</mark>"

8099,"<mark> Can the Prime Minister explain why the only person to have resigned so far following this scandal is Allegra Stratton, a woman, while he, the man who sanctioned and attended at least one party in 10 Downing Street, still sits in his place Advisers advise and Ministers decide</mark>"
8100,"<mark> After a recent survey showed that 37% of small businesses felt totally unprepared for the introduction of import controls, rules of origin and the upcoming sanitary and phytosanitary checks, will he listen to the Federation of Small Businesses and introduce financial and technical support for those small businesses, or is he just too busy drinking in his garden</mark>"
8101,<mark> 1150</mark>
8102,<mark> This is a Government who have been found to have acted unlawfully by the High Court over covid contracts and who are now preparing to write off £4</mark>
8103,<mark>3 billion that had been allocated to those covid schemes</mark>
8104,<mark> Why can the UK Government find billions of pounds for profiteers and fraudsters but not find the compassion to treat the people with dignity by lifting the benefits cap and reinstating the cut to universal credit</mark>
8105,"<mark> That is why, through the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, we are providing £189 million of funding this yeara 27% increase on the previous financial yearin spite of all the difficulties this country is facing</mark>"
8106,<mark> We have also provided a loan facility of up to £145 million to support all the wonderful work the British Council does</mark>
8107,"<mark>We will certainly be legislating to expand the dormant assets scheme to include new financial assets, which would unlock an estimated £880 million</mark>"
8108,"<mark> Gentleman attacks the contracts for PPE, but actually I think it was an astonishing thing to be able, at great speed, to give this country 17 billion items of PPE</mark>"
8109,"<mark> Thanks to the efforts of people across Whitehall, this country is now capable of producing 80% of our own PPE</mark>"
8110,"<mark> Last week, local councils granted outline planning permission to create 6,000 new skilled jobs and secure many thousands of others, to inject £2</mark>"
8111,<mark>5 billion into our local economy and to level up across our region</mark>
8112,"<mark> We made another £350 million available through the automotive transformation fund, on top of the commitment of half a billion  pounds we have already made in a 10point plan</mark>"
8113,"<mark> In January 2021, the Government estimated that at least £800 million would be released from the dormant asset scheme extension</mark>"
8114,"<mark> What I can tell the House is that, throughout the pandemic, people across Government have been working flat out to protect the British public with huge quantities of personal protective equipment, so we can now make 80% of it in this country, with the biggest and most generous furlough scheme virtually anywhere in the world, and with the fastestand by the way, if we had listened to the Opposition, we would have stayed in the European Medicines Agency and we would never have been able to deliver the vaccine rollout at the speed that we did</mark>"
8115,"<mark>We will continue to look after people throughout this pandemic and beyond, but we have also been cutting crime by 10% and putting 11,000 more police officers out on the streets</mark>"

8119,"<mark>In Clwyd South, the Welsh Government have been dragging their feet on urgent repairs to the Newbridge Road, while in contrast the Prime Minister and his Government have delivered record levellingup fund investment of £13</mark>"
8120,"<mark>3 million along the Dee Valley, from the Trevor basin to Llangollen and Chirk, and on to Corwen</mark>"
8121,"<mark> Bedfordshire, in common with many other police forces, has lost out on about 95 officers as a result of the imposition of damping in 2004</mark>"
8122,<mark> We are launching a plan tomorrow to get half a million people off welfare and into work</mark>
8123,"<mark> In the meantime, the people of this country want to hear what we are doing to tackle the issues that matter to all of us fixing the cost of living; helping people across the country by lifting the living wage; helping people with their fuel costs, as this Government are doing; and cutting the tax of people on universal credit by £1,000</mark>"
8124,"<mark> We have been prioritising the covid backlogs, investing massively in 9 million more scans, so that people get the treatment that they need and that they have been waiting for, and making sure that we have 44,000 more people in ourInterruption</mark>"
8125,<mark>I once had a memorable swim in the WyeI think at about 5 oclock in the morningand it tasted like nectar</mark>

8140,<mark>7 billion on personal protective equipment and the Chancellor is writing off £4</mark>
8141,<mark>3 billion in fraud</mark>
8142,<mark> Why did this Government block the National Crime Agency from investigating all the billions they lost to fraud</mark>
8143,"<mark>Of course we despise fraud and those who steal from the taxpayer, which is why we have already recovered £743 million in lost furlough money and £2</mark>"

8652,"<mark> 2, you can have a deferred payments agreement if you move out and are living in residential care</mark>"
8653,"<mark> Even if you are not one of those people who suffer from those afflictions, we are taking away the anxiety from millions of people up and down the land about their homes</mark>"
8654,"<mark> If you go down to £100,000, that is the beginning of where we will ask you to contribute, but your home is not included in that</mark>"
8655,"<mark> Only a few weeks ago, Labour Members failed to vote for the £36 billion that will enable us to fix this and to help people up and down the countrynot just to fix the social care problem, but to pay for people to live in their own homes and receive the care they need in their homes</mark>"
8656,"<mark> Under the Prime Ministers plans, a person with assets worth about £100,000, most of it tied up in their home, would have to pay £80,000</mark>"
8657,"<mark> If you have a house worth about £120,000 to £140,000, how do you find £80,000plus without selling your home It is common sense</mark>"
8658,"<mark>The Cherwell Larder in Kidlington does incredible work to serve nearly 2,000 of my most vulnerable constituents, but there simply is not enough food to go around at the moment</mark>"
8659,"<mark> The stock of charities such as FareShare is down 30%, in part due to the same supply chain issues that are affecting supermarkets</mark>"
8660,"<mark>Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition is isolating, so I call Ed Miliband to ask the questions on behalf of the Opposition</mark>"
8661,<mark> The problem is that the world has not delivered on the $100 billion of finance promised more than a decade ago in Copenhagen</mark>
8662,<mark> The plan is to deliver it maybe in 2023</mark>
8663,"<mark> Actually, one of the first things I did as Prime Minister was go out to my first United Nations General Assembly as Prime Minister and announce a huge £11</mark>"
8664,<mark>6 billion commitment from the UK to help the developed world to tackle climate change</mark>
8665,<mark> Gentleman that this country is working flat out to ensure that we do reach the £100 billion commitment from the whole of the world</mark>
8666,"<mark> That £1 billion investment will improve safety and congestion and help to level up our region, supporting jobs, essential services and tourism, but we have to get the project right</mark>"
8667,<mark>The focus is certainly on 2030</mark>
8668,"<mark> Labours plans, which I think he endorsed, were condemned by the GMB unionits paymastersfor meaning that it would be confiscating peoples cars by 2030 and that families would be allowed only one aeroplane flight every five years</mark>"
8669,<mark> Member for Doncaster North Edward Miliband is right in what he says about the need to keep 1</mark>
8670,<mark>5 alive</mark>
8671,<mark> We have moved from only 30% of the global economy committed to net zero by the middle of the century to now 80%</mark>
8672,"<mark> On the eve of COP, it warned that far from halving global emissions this decade, we are on course to reduce them by only about 7</mark>"
8673,<mark>5%</mark>
8674,"<mark>Indeed I do, but what I think the House should also recognise is how far we have moved in the space of a few years since the Paris COP summit of 2015, where, as I am sure the right hon</mark>"
8675,"<mark> Gentleman will remember, the world agreed to net zero by 2100, by the end of the century, and agreed to try to restrain global warming by 4</mark>"
8676,<mark> We are now trying to keep alive the prospect of restricting that growth to 1</mark>
8677,<mark>5</mark>
8678,"<mark> Every day, countries are coming through with solid commitments on stopping the output of coalfired power stations, reducing their use of internal combustion engines, planting millions of trees and investing hundreds of billions of  pounds in the developing world</mark>"
8679,"<mark>I will just correct the Prime Minister on one point it was the second half of the century that was set out in Paris, not 2100 for net zero</mark>"
8680,"<mark> Australia recently announced a 2050 net zero target, but its 2030 target would head the world towards approximately 4 of global warming</mark>"
8681,"<mark> Please keep the focus on 2030, not 2050 and beyond</mark>"
8682,"<mark> Gentleman is completely wrong, and I think he should withdraw what he has just said about the £11</mark>"
8683,"<mark>6 billion, because we remain absolutely committed to the £11</mark>"
8684,<mark>6 billion that we are investing to tackle climate change around the world</mark>
8685,"<mark> I talked to the Prime Minister of Australia only recently, and Australia has just, with great difficulty, made the commitment to get to net zero by 2050</mark>"
8686,"<mark> For instance, Joko Widodo, a good friend of this country, has agreed on coal to bring forward the abolition of coal use in Indonesia to 2040a fantastic effort by the Indonesians</mark>"
8687,<mark> The problem is that the Prime Ministers boosterism will not cut carbon emissions in half</mark>
8688,<mark> Photo opportunities will not cut carbon emissions in half</mark>
8689,<mark> Gentleman talks about cutting CO2 in half</mark>
8690,"<mark> Since 1990, we have cut CO2 by 44% and the economy has grown by 78%</mark>"
8691,"<mark> That is our approacha sensible, pragmatic Conservative approach that cuts CO2, that tackles climate change and that delivers highwage, highskilled jobs across this country</mark>"
8692,<mark> A massive 4</mark>
8693,<mark>3 billion toasties were consumed last yearthey are the nations favourite snackand glorious Somerset is the home of cheddar cheese</mark>
8694,"<mark> Friend know that eating cheddar from Somerset can reduce ones cheese consumption carbon footprint by 55%, and will he support our vital diary industry by committing himself to enjoying a carbonneutral cheese toastie today</mark>"
8695,"<mark>This week, it was revealed that fossilfuel companies, interest groups and climate denialists had donated £1</mark>"
8696,<mark>3 million to the Conservative party and its MPs since 2019</mark>
8697,"<mark> Gentleman makes a very important point about the high energy costs for energyintensive industries, and that is why we have abated them with about £2 billion since 2013</mark>"
8698,<mark>5 will have devastating consequences for our planet</mark>
8699,"<mark> Does the Prime Minister agree that, to keep the goal of 1</mark>"
8700,"<mark>5 alive, we need to roughly halve global emissions in this decisive decade</mark>"
8701,<mark> The World Food Programme estimates that more than half the populationabout 22</mark>
8702,"<mark>8 million peopleface acute food insecurity, and 3</mark>"
8703,<mark>2 million children under five could suffer acute malnutrition</mark>
8704,"<mark> Gentleman will recall, was double our aid commitment for this year to £286 million</mark>"
8705,"<mark> His family and his club, the West Bridgford Colts, raised money in his  honour to buy more defibrillators to put onsite, but were faced with a VAT bill of hundreds of pounds on each lifesaving device</mark>"
8706,"<mark> Today, the Disasters Emergency Committee is launching its Ukraine appeal, and every pound donated by the British people will be matched by the Government, starting with £20 million</mark>"
8707,"<mark> Friend said about our bond with and our debt to the Ukrainian people Never forget that when we stood side by side with Russia in the 1940s against fascism, the Ukrainian contribution to that army was 10 million people, and they were absolutely invaluable in freedom as well</mark>"
8708,<mark> Some £100 billion a year is awash in our country</mark>
8709,"<mark> What we have is a plan to be as generous as we possibly can to the people of Ukraine; the numbers that will come under our family reunion scheme alone could be in the hundreds of thousands, to say nothing of the special new path we are opening up, the humanitarian path, which is also uncapped</mark>"
8710,"<mark> At the same time, the population has expanded, with thousands of new homes being built in Warrington and putting pressure on services, particularly at the general hospital</mark>"
8711,"<mark>Two weeks ago in a letter to the Prime Minister, I outlined that over half a million people in the UK are immunocompromised, and to them, the idea of living with covid is frightening, while many charities such as the MS Society are not reassured by the Governments lifting of restrictions around free testing and isolation</mark>"
8712,"<mark> Shuvalov owns two flats not five minutes walk from this House, and they are worth more than £11 million</mark>"
8713,"<mark>Will the Prime Minister instruct the Conservative party to give to Ukrainian humanitarian causes the £2 million it has accepted from Lubov Chernukhin This includes £80,000 referred to in data released today by the Electoral Commission</mark>"
8714,"<mark> Leaked documents show that Lubov Chernukhin received £8 million from a Russian member of Parliament, an ally of Putin who was later sanctioned by the United States</mark>"
8715,"<mark> Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the horrors of this war, and they desperately need refuge and sanctuary</mark>"
8716,"<mark> The United Nations estimates that well over half a million Ukrainian refugees need urgent help, most of them women and children</mark>"
8717,"<mark> David Cameron succeeded, but after he left we abandoned his proven onein, twoout regime and added billions in red tape costs instead</mark>"
8718,"<mark> I can tell him that, on Thursday, $250 billionworth of assets were wiped off the Russian stock market and the rouble fell by about 40%</mark>"
8719,<mark> That is why we are increasing the farming investment fund to £48 million</mark>
8720,<mark> We know from Grozny what Vladimir Putins intention is hundreds of thousands of people will be murdered in those cities</mark>
8721,"<mark> We have a £200 discount on bills, a £150 nonrepayable reduction in council tax, and £144 million extra to help councils support vulnerable families with their energy bills</mark>"
8722,"<mark> Altogether, there is a £20 billion package of financial help that we are giving the British people, and we will continue to do more</mark>"
8723,"<mark> It is a condition that kills 2,000 every year needlesslymore than those who die on the roadsyet most people do not know anything about it until it devastates their family, as it did mine</mark>"
8724,"<mark> Over half a century ago, we took in more than 27,000 Ugandans expelled by Idi Amin</mark>"
8725,"<mark> But this week, the Home Office turned away hundreds of Ukrainian refugees escaping Putins bombs because they did not have the right paperwork</mark>"
8726,"<mark> The numbers are almost 1,000 as I speak to the right hon</mark>"
8727,<mark> They are uncapped and we expect those numbers to rise to in the region of hundreds of thousands</mark>
8728,"<mark>2 million refugees, Hungary has taken over 190,000 refugees, Germany has taken over 50,000 refugees, Italy has taken over 7,000 refugees and Irelanda country of just over 5 million peoplehas given sanctuary to three times as many refugees as the United Kingdom</mark>"
8729,"<mark> Friend the Secretary of State for Levelling Up will be setting out a route by which the British peoplenot just the family reunion route, which can run into the hundreds of thousands, but a route by which everybody in this countrycan offer a home to people fleeing Ukraine</mark>"
8730,"<mark>For more than two decades, Thames Water has been trying to build a reservoir in my constituency that would be more than 30 metres high and would cover the equivalent of more than 2,500 football pitches</mark>"
8731,"<mark> In France, energy supply company EDF has had energy price rises to domestic customers capped at 4%, but this Governments price cap allows EDF to increase prices to UK customers by 54%</mark>"
8732,"<mark>The typical energy bill is going up by £700 next month, and that is because of pressures before Russia invaded Ukraine</mark>"
8733,"<mark> What is the Chancellors solution A forced £200 loan for every household, to be paid back in mandatory instalments over five years</mark>"
8734,<mark> Working families are facing a £700 spike in April</mark>
8735,<mark> They will not even receive their £200 loan from the Chancellor until October</mark>
8736,"<mark> The wholesale price of oil and gas is now ballooning, so by October when the loan finally comes in, household bills are set to shoot up by another £1,000</mark>"
8737,<mark> BP made £9</mark>
8738,"<mark> That is why Labour set out a plan to upgrade the 19 million British homes that desperately need it within a decade, saving families £400 on their energy bills and cutting UK gas imports by 15%, whereas all the Government have is a failed policy</mark>"
8739,"<mark> Friend the Chancellor has set out plans to help families with energy costs and unprecedented measures to abate council tax by £150, in addition to all the other schemes that we are putting forward</mark>"
8740,"<mark>It is thanks to the policies that this Government have pursued that we are dependent on Russian gas for only 3% of our gas needs, unlike virtually every other European country</mark>"
8741,<mark> Great news There is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth than over a hundred others</mark>
8742,"<mark>I just remind the House that under the Labour Government, our nuclear output fell from about 25% to 10% of our energy needs, and as I recall, that was because of the decisions they took</mark>"
8743,"<mark> and learned Gentleman asked about the cost of energy bills, and we are helping households with the cost of energy bills to the tune of £9</mark>"
8744,<mark>1 billion</mark>
8745,"<mark>We will make sure that we do everything to support the people of the whole of the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, and we  have already extended a further £250 million to help the people of Northern Ireland with the costs of living, particularly heating</mark>"
8746,"<mark> We have already got 1,000 people in under the existing scheme</mark>"
8747,<mark> That family reunion route alone could bring hundreds of thousands of people here</mark>
8748,"<mark> Given that his many weaknesses could leave him open to blackmail, why does the Prime Minister think that MI6 may not entirely trust him</mark>"
8749,"<mark> Since he came to office, PO has received more than £38 millionworth of Government contracts, and the parent company, DP World, is lined up for £50 million of taxpayers money under the freeport scheme</mark>"
8750,<mark> Lower borrowing and increased taxes mean that he is sitting with £20 billion to spend today</mark>
8751,"<mark> So the test for the Prime Minister is this will the Government use the full £20 billion they are sitting on to scrap the national insurance tax hike and put money into peoples pockets, or will he simply make this Tory poverty pandemic even worse</mark>"
8752,"<mark> Friend agree that it is now time to raise the age of legal sale of tobacco products from 18 to 21 and impose a levy on the profits of the big tobacco companies, in order to raise £700 million that we can put into smoking cessation services, on the basis that the polluter pays</mark>"
8753,"<mark> Never forget that under the last Labour Government, there was £23 billion lost in fraud every year</mark>"
8754,"<mark> That is why, in Scotland, the SNP Government are doubling the Scottish child payment and raising the benefits they control by 6%that is double the rate the Chancellor has proposed for the benefits that he has control over</mark>"
8755,"<mark> So this is a very simple question for the Prime Minister if he truly understands that this is an emergency, will he match the Scottish Governments commitment and lift all benefits by 6%</mark>"
8756,"<mark>I warmly welcome the improvements to our national Ukraine refugee response, but in the weeks since these improved measures, numbers fleeing Putins invasion have sadly doubled to 3</mark>"
8757,"<mark>5 million, and are expected to go even higher</mark>"
8758,"<mark> Member for Macclesfield David Rutley was forced to come to the House to announce more than 1,100 DWP job losses and 42 centre closures, risking a further 7,000 jobs, including 1,300 in the northeast</mark>"
8759,"<mark>Eight hundred British workers were sacked over Zoom by PO, owned by the Government of Dubai, to be replaced with foreign exploited agency workers on less than two quid an hour</mark>"
8760,<mark>8 billionalmost exactly the same as the amount that national insurance on working people will increase in the coming year</mark>
8761,"<mark>Eight hundred loyal British workers fired over Zoom, instantly replaced by foreign agency workers shipped in on less than the minimum wageif the Prime Minister cannot stop that, what is the point of his Government</mark>"
8762,"<mark> The Prime Minister says how disappointed he is in them, while handing them £50 million</mark>"
8763,<mark> Why does the Prime Minister think that they will take a crumb of comfort from his halfarsed bluster and waffle today</mark>
8764,"<mark> If the Prime Minister wants to remove the latest suspicion of his conflicts of interest, will he tell his Dubai millionaire friends that if they want contracts to run freeports here, they must reinstate PO workers and guarantee the jobs of DP World workers too</mark>"
8765,"<mark> If the company is found guilty, it will face fines running into millions of pounds</mark>"
8766,<mark> We have unemployment back down to 3</mark>
8767,"<mark>9%, we have 600,000 more people on the payroll and the best assurance we can give workers around the country is that the economy is now bigger than it was before the pandemic began</mark>"
