175, Channel 4 has made really great strides in the digital space

193,Channel 4 spent £516 million on original content in 2006
194, That number fell to £329 million because advertising incomes fell at a similar pace
195," Friend agree that unless we do something, Channel 4 is at risk of stagnating, and that we can keep a similar news remit, commitment to diversity and investment in nations and regions in a different model"
196," In recognition of what he says, the reason that previous Secretaries of State looked at this matter was that they could see a number of trends, particularly on spend on linear advertising, that were only going in the wrong direction for a broadcaster like Channel 4, which is uniquely dependent on that spend"
197, Something like 70% of its revenues come from linear advertising spend

246," We think that we can get the right blend by retaining Channel 4s public service broadcast remit, which maintains its distinct and unique appeal, while enabling it to get the private sector capital investment that it requires to deal with some of the wider challenges presented by the likes of Netflix"
247," If Channel 4 is to remain uniquely appealing, we need that investment in content, and we believe that the reforms will give it greater sustainability going forward"
248," In this country, we are able to have a great blend of specific public service remits that private broadcasters can deliver, and that is what we would seek to do with Channel 4 going forward, protecting the things that we enjoy and love about it"
249, We believe that any future buyer of Channel 4 would seek to purchase it precisely to tap into the specific markets that it appeals to

255," Friend was right, of course, to say that previous Secretaries of State have considered the privatisation of Channel 4, but she will also recognise that not all of us were persuaded at the time that it was the right thing to do"
256," If the Government are determined to privatise Channel 4, she will also recognise, I am sure, that one of the things that makes Channel 4 distinctive is its willingness to take risks and commission work it cannot be sure will be successful"

275, Those are three things that would make a difference to millions of people
276," This Bill is littered with various things we have voted against throughout the process, in relation to voting, to political finance and to electoral systems, but today we are really down to just two issues voter ID, as set out in part 1 of the Bill; and the independence of the Electoral Commission, as set out in part 3"

281," I stood for election in my constituency in 92 when poll tax had been introduced and 5,000 people dropped off the register thereby the sound of it, most of them were Labour voters because I lost by 54 votes"
282, I did not suggest that Channel 4 would pursue a Netflix subscription model; I simply made the point that Netflix and othersthis is not a Netflix issue aloneare changing the dynamics of the marketplace very rapidly
283, She took the responsible decision to look not just at Channel 4 but at how we ensure that public service broadcasters have the flexibility they need to be able to provide the content that we all love
284," Friend plays an important role through her work with the allparty parliamentary group for Channel 4, and I am glad for the engagement that we have already had on the issue"
285, Friend raises the alternatives that Channel 4s management put forward
286, Our reforms are really to sustain Channel 4s place in in our creative ecology
287, I simply refer him to my previous answers we would maintain Channel 4 as a freetoair service
288, Channel 4 is intrinsic to making all of that work because it does something that no other broadcaster in the world ever did it guarantees diversity through the private sector for everybody

292,"6 billion to the Exchequer through air passenger duty, and it is expected to be at 70% demand this summer, so we cannot put this at risk, for the sake of our economy"
293," I would also make the point again that 90% of applications were completed within six weeks, and the service standard is 10 weeks"
294," It was 13% higher than the previous record, so we are talking about it beating that record not by one but by some distance"
295," As I said, there are 500 extra staff and we are in the process of recruiting more; between January and March, 90% of applications were dealt with within six weeks; and support is there"
296," To be clear, those staff have now fully returned to passport production, and on 1 April more than 4,000 staff were working on it"
297," Last year, we sent 4"
298,7 million texts to those who had not renewed their passport to try to encourage more people to get their passport applications in
299," As I have touched on several times, we saw record output last month, with over 1 million passports dealt with in just one month, whereas normally we deal with 7 million across a whole year"

301,"Again, let us go back to what we have already said 4"
302,"7 million texts were sent out last year; 1 million passports were issued last montha record amount; more staff are being recruited; and existing staff, if they wish, are being given the opportunity to work incentivised overtime"
303," There has been a large amount of planning and work done to meet the challenge, but inevitably, with 2"
304,"5 million extra passport applications due this year, on top of the 7 million that we expect to receive from those whose passports fall due this year, there were going to be pressures in the system"

311,"Prior to the pandemic, HM Passport Office routinely processed approximately 7 million passports each year"
312, Over the last two years the necessary restrictions on international travel meant only 4 million people applied for a British passport in 2020 and 5 million in 2021
313, This left about 5 million unrenewed passports
314, We expect this year to deal with 9
315,5 million British passport applications and have been planning for this
316," These preparations ensured passport applications could be processed in record numbers, last month seeing the highest total for any month on record, with HM Passport Office completing the processing of over 1 million applications, 13% higher than the previous record output"
317," The vast majority of applications continue to be processed within 10 weeks; in fact, over 90% of applications were issued within 6 weeks between January and March 2022, despite the muchincreased demand"
318," Their hard work will enable millions of British citizens to enjoy a holiday abroad this summer, and I thank them for that"
319," I reassure people that, as I touched on, 90% of applications were done in six weeks"
320,"As we have touched on, we are seeing an unprecedented level of demand we would normally process 7 million applications in an entire year and did 1 million last month alone"
321," As I said, though, in recent months 90% of people have still been getting their passport within six weeks and we retain the ability to expedite if people have particularly compelling reasons for travel"
322," I do not expect that would massively mitigate the number of applications we are receiving, given that during the pandemic 5 million passports were not renewed, and we expect a lot of people will now want to renew, looking ahead to summer holiday travel, but I certainly welcome the right hon"
323," As I said, there are 5 million unrenewed passports and we expect 2"
324,"5 million of them to be renewed, and that is on top of the normal 7 millionstrong demand each year"
326," Certainly, 90% between January and March were issued within six weeks, so not the 10week standard, and over 1 million were issued last month"
327, We sent out 4
328,7 million texts to people who had not renewed their passports to point out that there might be a surge if they wished to travel in the following year
329," As I say, we are still managing to deal with most passport applications relatively quickly, with over 90% issued with six weeks"
330, No other month has seen over 1 million passports issued
331," In terms of being low on delivery, we delivered more than 1 million passport decisions last montha record number"
332," With a holiday booked in May, they risk losing thousands and thousands of pounds if they are unable to travel"
333," In 2020 and 2021, the Home Office was asked what it was doing to plan, but people are already losing holidays, trips to see loved ones and thousands of pounds that they have spent in good faith because of the lack of planning at the Passport Office and at the Home Office, which is in danger of becoming a StayatHome Office instead for people this summer"
334,"There has been a spike in demand for passports, but that should have been anticipated since we know that 5 million people put off renewing their passport during lockdown"

344," Amendment a will require the Secretary of State, when preparing a statement, to have regard to the duty placed on the commission by section 1451 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 to monitor and ensure compliance with the rules set out in that Act"
345, These amendments provide for enhanced parliamentary scrutiny of a statement that has been subject to statutory consultation under new section 4C of the 2000 Act by providing both Houses with a supplementary opportunity to consider the draft statement and make representations before it is laid for approval
346," It was therefore necessary for the Government to table Lords amendments 6 to 8, 13, 14, 24 to 28, 30 to 33, 37, 38, 40 to 43, 46 to 48, 51 to 63, 88 to 102, 117, 125 and 126 to ensure the measures apply to reserved matters only"
347," Rightly, much has been made of the calibre of some of Channel 4s programming, but tonights schedule includes The Great Home Transformation, Grand Designs The Streets, Bling Ring Hollywood Heist and Shocking Emergency Calls UK"
348, We think that any future buyer would look at the unique and distinct content that Channel 4 provides as one of its great assets
349," We are able to protect some of that via the remit, which we would seek to do, but it is also important that Channel 4 is only one part of why the creative sector has been very successful in Northern Ireland"
350,I very much welcome the opportunity to talk in this House about The Crystal Maze and the fantastic content that Channel 4 has produced over the years
351, Our reforms are fundamentally about making sure that Channel 4 can continue to make the investments that my hon

353, Channel 4 is in the best state that it has been in creatively or financially for decades
354," If they do not, they could engage with Channel 4s management team about its proposalsI am not sure that we have all seen them in publicand explain why they prefer to go to the United States than to have a state broadcaster that is independent of Government"
355," Alongside the £617 million in city and growth deal funding, the levelling up, community renewal and community ownership funds have invested £62 million to date in the people and places most in need in Northern Ireland as a demonstration of our commitment to the people of Northern Ireland"
356," We certainly accept the point that there need to be significant improvements in the performance of the advice line and the MPs line, and we are already engaging with Home Office teams about how we can get more resources in so that people can have their queries answered, particularly when Members of Parliament raise issues on behalf of those with compelling and compassionate reasons for travel and therefore need their application to be expedited"

360,"The selloff of Channel 4 is an important matter for Parliament, yet instead of a statement we had announcement by tweet during recess, and now we hear that a White Paper is to be published tomorrow, when we will not be here and there will not be an opportunity for statements"
361, Nothing screams rudderless Government like fixating on the governance of Channel 4 while peoples energy bills are going through the roof
362," Is it to help level up the country Given that Channel 4 commissions half its budget outside London, creating a pipeline of talent across the nations and regions, and stimulating the creative economy in places such as Leeds, Glasgow and Bristol, of course it is not"
363," Or is it to save the Treasury money I know that the Secretary of State was a bit confused about this in front of the Select Committee, but Channel 4 does not cost the taxpayer a single penny"
364," She says the selloff will generate a pot of up to £1 billion for her to dish out in grants, but Channel 4 already invests that amount here, commercially, each and every year"
365," She says she will protect the essence of Channel 4 in a new remit, but I thought that was the straitjacket she wanted to free it from"
366," Channel 4 is a great British asset, owned by the public, that does not cost them a penny"
367," As the Member of Parliament for Bradford West, Channel 4 in Leeds makes a real difference to diversity, especially in news channels and in journalism as a whole"
368," Can the Minister assure me that if we go down that road and they privatise it, the buyer will be required to maintain the presence and trajectory of workforce growth in Channel 4s regional offices in Leeds, Glasgow, Bristol and Manchester"
369," May I therefore urge on the Minister the very Conservative action of listening to the voice of small businessthe many small businesses and creative companiesthat Members from all sides of the House are praising because they provide innovation, creativity and jobs around the country, precisely serving the levellingup agenda Can she tell us, having looked at the consultation responses the Government have not published, what is the overwhelming voice from those small businesses They are all saying that Channel 4 is not broke and does not need fixing in this way"
370," For the supply chain, it will mean laying off up to 2,000 workers"
371,"Channel 4 invests about £20 million a year in Scottish independent production companies, contributing £36 million in gross  value added and supporting about 400 jobs"
372," Glasgowbased indies do get contracts with Netflix and the others, but they are clear that the Channel 4 model is at the heart of their success"
373,"How do the proposals genuinely fit in with our levellingup agenda What protections and safeguards would be put in place to ensure that Channel 4s HQ not only stays in Leeds, but continues to flourish there What safeguards can be put on Channel 4s excellent commitment to quality regional TV production so that it can continue to flourish, particularly because Channel 4 currently invests more in independent production companies outside London than any other broadcaster and supports thousands of jobs outside London"

391," By 2017, its vote had gone down by about 26%"
392," Does he agree that the UK Government have thus far committed £41 million to that project However, that was not what I wanted to intervene on; I wanted to intervene on his mention of the £500 million just transition fund for the northeast of Scotland"
393," Members for Kilmarnock and Loudoun Alan Brown and for Aberdeen South Stephen Flynn have not been able to do thus far, and describe in detail what that £500 million will be spent on in the northeast of Scotland"

398, Inflation stands at 7% and rising; household bills have gone up by hundreds of pounds; the cost of the weekly shop has rocketed; and people are seeing their wages run out much earlier in the month and the value of their savings fall
399," That would take £400 off energy bills every year and cut gas imports by 15%, but this Prime Minister is far too concerned with vanity projects ever to prioritise investment in insulating homes"
400," If the Tories had simply matched Labours record on growth in Government, people would have had higher incomes, boosting public finances, and we could have spent over £40 billion more on public services without having to raise a single tax"

402,"8%, meaning that huge swathes of serious offences like rape, knife crime and theft have effectively been decriminalised"

412," In time, there will, I am sure, be much for us to be proud of about the councils actions under Labour control, particularly the response to covid, but we have to confront now the question of whether, despite cuts in Government funding to Harrow Council of more than 90%, better council services could have been provided"
413," It comes in a context where we have seen the Tory vote across Scotland  collapse, with the Labour revival amounting nationally to no more than a lacklustre 1"
414,6% increase in first preference votes on the council elections in 2017 and its secondworst local government performance since devolution in 1999
415,"7% living below the poverty line, sadly things look as though they are set to get even worse"
416," As well as the attacks on Scotlands democratically elected Parliament, which are set to continue, our resource budget allocation has been cut by Westminster by 5"
417,2% and the capital budget allocation has been cut by 9
418,7% in real terms
419," In all but one year, growth under this Government was less than 2%"
420," Under Labour, 2% growth was achieved 10 years straight"

422, Last year there were 1
423,"78 million violent crimes, which is 1"
424,78 million opportunities to see the full cost of that failure
425," Gentleman does not want his speech dominated by the Northern Ireland issue, but will he accept that the Northern Ireland protocol is not only adding significantly to the cost of living crisis in Northern Ireland and slowing down the Northern Ireland economys recovery from covid, but poisoning the very essence of the Belfast agreement, and therefore stopping the working of the institutions It removes democracy, because not only Unionist Members, but all Members of the Assembly will have no say on 60% of the laws"
426," They could have chosen to ask energy companies to share a little of their grotesque wealth, or they could have asked landlords and property billionaires to pay a little more"
427," In my constituency alone, the Scottish Government are forced to spend £11"
428,8 million each year to mitigate the worst of what Westminster throws at us
429," As an aside, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Anna Cookson and the team on BBC Radio Kents  The Wake Up Call on, a week ago, winning an ARIAAudio and Radio Industry Awardin the teeth of competition from, I believe, the Today programme, Radio 5 Live and others"
430," I am not philosophically opposed to the privatisation of Channel 4, but I do believe we are in danger of throwing a baby out with the bathwater"
431," I hope very much that if we are going to continue to go down this road, we take great care to seek to secure the future of the independent production industry that Channel 4 has fostered"
432," Some two and a half years later, that commitment has not been honoured"
433," Companies such as Centrica, BP and Shell are making record profits, much of which goes to their already wellheeled shareholders, and yet my constituentsand those of Members on both sides of this Househave seen a 50% increase in the energy price cap and are likely to see an equivalent increase later this year"
434," She is frightened that that will go, and makes the point that his 3"
435,"1% benefit increase for his disability is, de facto, a serious decrease in his income, as inflation is likely to hit 10% later this year"
436, They have seen only a 3
437,"1% increase in their pensions, when they know inflation will hit levels way above that"
438," Even increasing the national minimum wage by 50p to £10, for which many on the Opposition Benches argue, would yield in the order of £900 a year"
439, The average income in my constituency is £250 a week less than is earned in wages in the Prime Ministers constituency
440," That is a staggering difference £12,500 a year per person working in a fulltime occupation"
441," We have a society that is now profoundly unequal, in which the billionaires are floating on a sea of riches while millions of people are living in poverty, including children and families in work"
442," When inequality and the lack of social mobility are put together, what do we have We have a class structure, the old British disease ossified, unchanging and built on a system that enriches a few and leaves so many millions behind"
443, Paying people in my area the same as people in the Prime Ministers would require a fifth of £1 billion a year; getting halfway there would cost us a staggering £100 million a year
444, It would cost £200 million a year to pay people in my constituency what people earn down in the Prime Ministers
445, That is why we have already committed £9
446,1 billion to assist with energy costs alone
447," We are giving back £150 to people in their council tax, cutting fuel duty, increasing the warm  home discount, creating a tax cut for 30 million workers by raising the national insurance threshold and delivering the biggest ever increase in the national living wage, worth an extra £1,000 a year to those working full time"
448," But however great our compassion and ingenuity, we cannot simply spend our way out of this problem; we need to grow out of the problem by creating hundreds of thousands of new highwage, highskilled jobs across the country"
449," This Government help people with the cost of heating, with the £9"
450,"1 billion that we are putting in, with the holiday activities and food programme and with the extra billions that we are putting in to support local councils"
451," We have heard a lot of words being very rapidly delivered, but what we have not heard yet is an apology to the pensioners who are choosing between heating and eating, an apology to the children who have gone hungry throughout the school holidays and an apology to the hundreds of thousands of family members of covid victims who were lost during the pandemic"
452,"I am very grateful for that intervention, and I agree 100% with what the hon"
453," If we go back to the 1970s, Nigg was a thriving industrial base, with thousands of jobs in that community supporting the oil industry"
454, I pay tribute to the speech that was given on her behalf
455," We are the rat run of choice for every HGV, whenever there is congestion on the M1 or the M40"
456," I do not know why that is so difficult, but I do know that by the end of the year, when inflation hits 10%, we will see even more people queuing at food banks, which is not a sight that any of us wish to see"
457," Of course, that situation will also be exacerbated by the 30% drop in Ukraines exports, particularly of cooking oil and wheat, which will increase hardship at our tables"
458," In the past few days, we have been bombarded with news of how household energy bills could hit £3,000 a year by October, how fire services across the country are reporting that they are dealing with blazes caused by people burning scraps of wood to keep warm, and, as was widely reported, how more than 2 million people are not eating every day because they just cannot afford it"
459," That move was referred to by the CEO of Tesco on Radio 4 today, and it would save every household hundreds of pounds a year on their fuel bills and provide muchneeded additional support to the lowestincome households"
460, The extra support in Wales includes a £150 cost of living payment to all households in properties in council tax bands A to D and to all those in receipt of any council tax benefit
461," There will be an extension to the Welsh winter fuel support scheme, which will provide people on low incomes and others with a nonrepayable £200 cash paymentnonrepayable being the key wordto help with their energy bills later this year, which they will receive on top of the £200 loan from the Government"
462," Today, we have 11,000 fewer police officers, 7,000 fewer police community support officers and 8,000 fewer police staff in work than we did when Labour left office in 2010"
463," With Wales facing a loss of more than £1 billion in unreplaced funding over the next three years, it begs the question as to whether the Prime Minister seriously thinks that the people of Wales have forgotten his Governments not a penny less promise to at least match, postBrexit, the size of the EU structural funds that Wales would have received"
464," Waless rail networks are underfunded by billions of pounds, and that needs addressing today"
465," We know that 14 million people are living in poverty, over 8 million of whom are in work"
466, We also know that 4
467,"5 million children living in poverty and, again, more than half of them are in working families"

469,"3 million more people living in absolute poverty, including 500,000 children"
470, She has developed estimates showing that £13
471,2 billion a year is being lost because of this differential in health
472," There is just 3%, when we know that inflation is currently at 7% and predicted to go to 10% by the end of the year"
473," That has to happen in the next three months, and the impact, according to the Governments own documents, is that nearly 1 million more people will be worse off"
474," A million more These are Government choices, unfortunately"
476," I should make it clear that different principles apply to Front Benchers from the three largest parties, who are nominated to speak on behalf of their parties"
477," For example, it is estimated that the additional cost of chilled food products is 18% as a result of the protocol, compared with the same products in Great Britain"
478, That is why I will be a loud voice for the brilliant Southend charity Prost8 and its groundbreaking work in this area
479," Some of it is things that we have announced hundreds of millions of pounds for, getting on for two years ago now, that are bogged down in process, and often bogged down in Whitehall"
480, Two thirds of my generation bought their own home; today it is a quarter
481," We are at least a million houses short, in a period in which the  population has increased by 7 million"
482," We are about 100,000 houses a year short in what we are constructing, in addition to that million"
483," In the last 20 years or so, the top 1% of the population have roughly trebled their income whereas the median has roughly flatlined, so there is a stronger argument for social mobility today than there was before"
484," For me, that only highlights the question what on earth have they been doing for the last 12 years Why are we looking at negative growth Why are we looking at a projection of 10% inflation Why are we notand why were we not beforemore resilient and able to cope with the pandemic that hit us Why are my constituents wages stagnating Why are they not any better off The paucity of speakers remaining says an awful lot, too"
485," However, we now know that apprenticeship starts have declined since 2010 by nearly 200,000, or 41%"
486," Too few apprenticeships are available because the levy is not working, with too many small businesses not participating and fewer level 2 and 3 apprenticeships available"

489," Where is the security if people cannot afford to buy their own home and cannot qualify for social rented housing In my constituency, that is in massively short supply in any case, with hundredsthousandsof families living in massively overcrowded conditions"
490," Every policy so far has fuelled the equity of those who already own their home, rather than giving a real legup to wannabe firsttime buyers in constituencies such as mine, whereI have said this repeatedly in this House, but I repeat it againa modern twobedroom flat will be on the market for about £750,000"
491, That is a huge increase9
492,1% over the past five years
493," According to teachers in my constituency, children in years 7 and 8 are having to be taught how to do decent handwriting because they missed those crucial years at primary school"
494," In some areas, pupils in years 7 and 8 are losing out because the qualified teachers are focused on the exam years"
495, That funding has fallen in real terms per pupil by 1
496,"2% for the most deprived fifth of schools, but has increased by nearly 3% for the least deprived fifth of schools"
497," It is not possible to have sustainable food and farming if we are going to build all over our grade 1 and grade 2 agricultural land, which is what is happening in Thanet at this very moment"
498," Some 70% of Englands land mass is farmed, so if we care about tackling climate change and the biodiversity crisis, the reality is that the greenest thing that any Government can do is keep Britains farmers farming"
499, All of the hundreds of farms that I represent are in that position
500," This year, 13 of the farms that I representa tiny proportion, little more than 1%will be getting anything from the new sustainable farming incentive"

506," In Devon, this has meant a 70% reduction in the longterm private rented sector"
507," The proposal takes no account of the fact that, for instance, 90% of second homes bought in my constituency are bought for investment and then let out for 70 days a year"
508," So I am angry, not just on behalf of my community but on behalf of communities across rural areas of our great country, that there is so little, if anything at all, for us in this Queens Speech"
509," The Chancellor is getting £9 billion more in VAT receipts than the Budget prediction of £38 billion, yet the Government say that they cannot afford a VAT cut"
510," That does not just mean a VAT cut; we want to increase and extend the warm home discount to help more than 7 million people with their heating bills, and we want to increase the winter fuel payment to help pensioners betrayed by the Conservatives when they broke their election promise on the pensions triple lock"
511," Only last week, we learnt that BP and Shell are now raking in £1 billion in profit between them every single week from the same soaring gas and petrol prices that are making families suffer so much"
512," They are selling them down the river with trade deals that allow lowwelfare foreign imports to undercut responsible British farmers, and cutting the payments on which they rely, which is costing some of them up to half their entire income"
513," In the southwest alone, farmers will lose almost £1 billion by the end of 2027 as a result of these Conservative policies"
514," And then there is the ticking timebomb of NHS dentistryor lack of itforcing people to shell out hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds for private work because they cannot get to see an NHS dentist"
515," More than 1 million people are missing out on the care they need right now, and still the Government are doing nothing to help"
516," According to one set of figuresand they still keep changingit came in at £90 billion below the Office for Budget Responsibility and Treasury forecast, because with more growth comes more activity, more incomes and more spending, so the Treasury can collect more VAT and income tax"
517," The two main aims of economic policy should be a 2% inflation target, embedded as a Government target as well as a control mechanism on the Bank of England, and a complementary 2% growth targetnot that exacting in the context of 20thcentury experience in the United Kingdom, but fairly challenging in the context of the current centurys experience because of the disfiguring effect of the big banking crash and great recession in the middle of its first two decades"
518," Anyone who wants to see what happens with the playbook should look at what is happening in Turkey at the moment, and at what has happened, on a grotesque scale, in Venezuela, where the generous state kept printing and kept borrowing and ended up destroying more than half its national income and much of the potential of the oil industry, which used to pay for everything because it was nationalised and incompetently run"
519, It makes green sense because the CO2 output created by burning our own gas is considerably less than that of the elaborate process of carrying it halfway round the world and having it compressed and decompressed so that it can travel as LNG
520, It is about half the CO2 generated
521," First and foremost, on the need to address the cost of living crisis, the Government have brought in some measures to help to support families and businesses, but more targeted assistance is required to enable people to get through the coming year, which many are facing with fear and trepidation with the expectation of inflation at 10% and Ofgems increase in the energy cap looming in the autumn"

527, He could have matched the increase in Scottishissued social security payments by 6%
528,7 billion from the revenues brought in from North sea oil
529," All that revenue from Scotlands resources, and still this  UK Government refuse to match the Scottish Governments £500 million just transition fund to help to ease reliance on fossil fuels"
530," Gentleman that yes, we will spell out exactly the plan for that £500 million transition fund"

535," The Scottish Government have helped to support the refurbishment of The Burrell Collection in Glasgow, and the city is becoming ever more popular as a location for the film industry, while the UK Government embark on the privatisation of Channel 4, which does not cost the taxpayer a penny, for purely ideological reasons"
536," They want urgent action to secure peace in the middle east, an end to arms sales to brutal regimes and the restoration of the 0"
537,7% aid spending target
538," Gentleman agree that it is remarkable that, for a Government who say that they care about the cost of living crisis, there was absolutely nothing new in this Queens Speech around, for example, a mass home insulation programme Such a programme would be the cheapest, most effective and fastest way of getting our emissions down, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, and tackling climate emissions, and yet we have nothing new on that at all in this Queens Speech"
539," As Members will know, Brecon and Radnorshire is two thirds of the historic county of Powys, so with a proposer and now a seconder coming from the undisputed better half of the county, I wonder how my hon"

837," At the same time, gas and oil giants are making £900 profit every second"
838," Yesterdays Queens Speech should have been the moment to make our energy system work for people, not for profit, by including a windfall tax to raise billions to lower the bills of millions"
839," Not only that, it should have introduced the price caps we have seen in France, which have allowed bills to rise by only 4% and not by the 54% we have seen here, and we should have seen action to bring the energy system back into public ownership so that it works for people and not for profit"
840," But the Prime Minister and his Government are willing to accept millions of people being forced into fuel poverty because that, to them, is more acceptable than the alternative of reducing the profits of the oil and gas giants"

904," Lords amendments 6D, 6E and 6F provide  that a person can be a tier 1 refugee if they have travelled briefly through countries on their way to the UK, as somebody from Kabul or Kyiv would have to, or if they have delayed presenting themselves to the authorities for a good reason"

915, She has discussed the merits of the objections to phase 2b of HS2 with my constituents who are injuriously affected
916," Those facilities, together with another proposed arrangement at the Crewe rolling stock depot, will, I believe, waste an estimated £475 million of taxpayers money"
917," With a further £171 million of savings to be made by the use of a Transport and Works Act order on phase 2, the Minister will know that I and parliamentary colleagues are calling for less than half the total of the £650 million saved to be directed towards the reopening of eight miles of the former North Staffordshire railway"
918, I therefore call on the Minister to amend the phase 2 Bill and remove the proposals for Ashley when it returns to the House
919," I greatly look forward to further discussions taking place between my constituents, the Ministers officials and appointed rail experts on how we can make required improvements to the phase 2a proposals as soon as possible"
920," Labour welcomes the muchneeded extension of High Speed 2, and has long supported HS2 being built in full, as that will help to address the severe capacity constraints on our rail network, and improve connections between cities in the midlands and the north"
921, We cannot accept a situation where just one UKbased firm was shortlisted for £2
922,5 billionworth of contracts for track and tunnel systems for HS2

924," Before Easter, in February and March 2022, more than 85% of queue measurements were under 45 minutes for nonEU passengers"
925," Secondly, the cost of HS2 had continued to rise at an eyewatering rate, and that was before we saw the current huge rates of inflation, which will put it up further"

934, That is why we consistently see 30% or 40% of our energy on many days in 2022 provided by renewables rather than by fossil fuels
935," We have made significant progress in the past 30 years, under Governments of all colours emissions down 40%, the economy up by nearly 80%, renewables now making up nearly 40% of our electricity generation in 2021, up from 7%, and by far the most advanced decarbonisation of any western country"
936, Last years United Nations Environment Programme production gap report concluded that in order to limit warming to 1
937,"5C, the world will need to decrease fossil fuel production by at least 6% per year between 2020 and 2030"
938,"5C, our analysis shows that all producer countries must peak their production immediately and begin an uninterrupted decline"
939," Tyndall analysis finds that the UK must reduce our oil and gas production by 50% in six years, which equates to an 8"

946,5 billion to UK energy bills over the past decade
947," I do not support any strategy that defines winning at this critical juncture in human history in terms that literally sacrifice the future of humanity, or indeed policies like a climate checkpoint that would somehow greenlight the pumping of new North sea oil and gas when there is no global scenario in which that is compatible with keeping 1"

955," What is more, 70% of what is left in the North sea basin is oil, not gasand it is not even the type of oil that we use in UK refineries anyway"
956," No Government in their right mind would consider such a move, and nor would they continue to support the fossil fuel industry through tax breaks and financial support for exploration and for research and development, yet that is happening, to the tune of £12 billion a year"
957," I know the Treasury does  not consider a penny of that to be a subsidy, but New Economics Foundation analysis found that around £10 billionworth is indeed covered by the subsidy definition used by, for example, the International Monetary Fund"
958, Shell alone received a £92 million tax rebate from the UK in 2021the largest total from any country in which it operates

961," The CCC is clear that coking coal used in steelmaking could be displaced completely by 2035, only halfway through the mines proposed lifetime"

987,2 million last year
988, From that £11
989,"2 million, which needs to pay for all services if there is to be a balanced budget without a deficit, it would need to deduct £3 million for the annual loan repayment"
990," In the financial year 202122, the council forecast a budget of £12"
991,55 million; £5
992,"5 million is from council tax, £3"

996, That is above the official cap in England of 2
997,"99%the maximum allowed without a referendum of local council tax payers, and a cap that some 286 councils across England and Wales are exceeding"
998,"5, there is evidence that, faced with the cost of living, people are asking the Government to help with the squeeze on bills by slowing down the increases in green levies"
999," In fact, in recent years, central Governmentthe Ministers Departmenthave given it significantly more money, as is laid out in the local government settlement, which includes £16"
1000,3 billion in settlement funding for local councils in England this financial year
1001," With other grants and an estimate of council tax included, the core spending of councils across England will rise to £54"
1002,"1 billion, which is an increase of 4"
1003,6% on the previous year

1009," This will be invested in about 2,000 new projects and schemes to better protect 336,000 properties"

1015,"Following their field trip to the River Wear last month, year 5 and 6 pupils at St Thomas More School in Belmont were saddened by the levels of pollution in the river, especially the amount of plastic, so they have asked me to come here today to keep everyone on the right track"
1016," Indeed, our new proposed target to reduce the amount of pollution in rivers such as the Wear in old abandoned mining areas by 50% by 2030 will make a genuine difference, as will our raft of other measures to tackle storm sewage overflows"
1017," From our portfolio of development land, we aim to deliver 29,000 new homes, more than 30% of which will be classed as affordable"
1018," For example, about 90% of those who have now been granted visas under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have done this via the biometric bypass they have not had to attend a VAC"

1032, She is working hard on behalf of a range of families to further this debate
1033," As we have heard, every year 1,800 children get a cancer diagnosis, and the biggest childhood cancer, leukaemia, accounts for about 30%"
1034," Just over 30% of children survived leukaemia in the 1970s, but things improved fast; in the 1990s, my cousin, Suzanne Adamson, had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia when she was 10 but she has gone on to have a wonderful life, with a second child on the way"
1035, So there are some good outcomes and the leukaemia survival rates in the 1990s were at 80%
1036," Cancer survival rates overall are now at 84%, but there is still room for improvement, as is shown by the death of Sophie"
1037," At present, there is still a 0% chance of fighting that cancer and being able to survive"
1038," He alone has raised thousands upon thousands of pounds for childrens charities, so that other parents do not have to suffer quite as much as the Pitcher family did"
1039," But that is the physical side of the illness; what of the psychological issues that children who have had cancer treatment will almost certainly face About threeandahalf years ago, I had a debate in this Chamber on this very subject, highlighting what I thought were the problems"
1040, Our Rayhan underwent 6 weeks of radiotherapy at the highest dose permitted for a child his age

1046, A recent trial for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia showed that young peoples survival rates improved by 18% through involvement in this clinical trial

1143," When will we see a workforce plan that takes account of the new responsibilities for vaccination that the NHS will have When will the budget for Health Education England be agreed, because two and a half months before the next financial year we still do not know what it is Will the workforce plan have independent forecasts so that we can make sure we are training enough doctors and nurses for the future"

1148," Rather than sacking compulsorily what may be over 100,000 health and social care workers, surely before the deadline is upon us we should reconsider this policy"
1149,"It is great news that the Minister reports that 93% of NHS staff have received the vaccinethat is fantasticand I commend every effort made to encourage NHS staff and all those involved in the delivery of care to receive the vaccine, but what will the Government do if, in a few weeks, a critically high number of people in the NHS have still not had the vaccine Will they all face being sacked or moved in April How would that protect the NHS"

1171," Friend said, to date over 93% of NHS staff have had their first jab"
1172," Those who are unvaccinated are eight times more likely to be hospitalised, and more than 60% of people in intensive care units are unvaccinated"
1173," NHS England is looking into it, to work out the best way to roll out the vaccine to that particularly vulnerable group of five to 11yearolds"
1174,"I refer back to the fact that the MHRA confirmed that the Pfizer vaccine is safe and effective in 12 to 17yearolds, and that followed the rigorous review of the safety, quality and effectiveness of the vaccines in this age group"

1176," Friend for her efforts to save us from vaccineonly passports, leaving the option for testing on the table, given what we know about the impact of vaccination on transmission and that fact that with compulsory vaccination the Governments central assumption is the loss of more than 100,000 healthcare workers"
1177,"When the facts change, we are entitled to change our minds, and since we passed the regulated activity regulations in December we have had further evidence to suggest that the transmissibility of covid declines after 10 or 12 weeks, as has been mentioned"
1178," Rather than forcing NHS staff to have their first vaccine by 3 February, which will present a massive risk to the NHSthe Governments own assessment is that between 64,000 and 115,000 NHS and healthcare staff will be sackedwill the Government go back and review the issue, and ask the JCVI what the best strategy is for managing the pandemic from this point forward"

1189,2 million will suffer acute malnutrition
1190," Fears of misuse of donor funds and of validating the Taliban remain valid, but given the urgency of tackling the crisis, does the Minister agree that the UK Government must do more If this is truly not a time for party politics, will she, as my colleagues requested, say yes to the international conference of 68 nations that Gordon Brown has suggested"
1191,"Behind the boasts of jabs in arms that for a while were distracting from the death figures, until we hit 150,000, are the Government not as worried as I am that the Office for National Statistics is finding vaccine hesitancy among the black British population more than five times higher than among the white population Among the over50s, just 44% of Caribbeans and 42% of Pakistanis have been boosted, as opposed to 77% of white British"

1193, The United Nations revealed yesterday that it needs £5 billion in aid for Afghanistan to avert a humanitarian catastrophe

1207," Just to be clear, £135 million of our aid has gone, to the end of December"

1229, The $4

1241," A tenant will still be in occupation if they are operating their business remotely and intend to return, so I do not believe amendment 9 is necessary"
1242," As I have previously explained, clause 17 establishes the timeframe for making awards, requiring arbitrators to make an award as soon as is practicable, or within 14 days in the case of an oral hearing"
1243, That means that it is hard for an arbitrator to know exactly when final proposals have been submitted and when the clock on the 14day time limit would start running
1244," Imposing a 14day time limit for issuing awards following an oral hearing, as the Bill doesalthough the time limit can be extendedis less problematic because the arbitrator will have seen the final proposals and had time to consider them before the hearing"
1245," Amendments 1 and 2 are technical amendments to make it clear that the definition of service charge in clause 2 covers both fixed and variable costs, as well as costs incurred by the landlord insuring against loss of rent"
1246," Amendments 4 and 7 make it clear that the general rule is that the party that has paid fees is to be reimbursed half the amount by the other party, but where appropriate, the arbitrator may determine a different proportion, including zero"
1247," Amendment 5 makes a small correction to clause 196 to make it clear that except for reimbursement of arbitration or oral hearing fees, a party must meet its own legal or other costs"
1248, Amendment 6 makes it clear that costs incurred in connection with arbitration are not recoverable under an existing clause in the lease
1249," The Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Department for the Economy have requested the removal of the existing delegated power for them to make regulations for purposes corresponding to the purposes of the Bill, set out in clause 28"
1250," The removal of clause 28 necessitates an amendment to the Extent provision in clause 302, which currently refers to this provision"
1251,"It is a pleasure to speak to new clause 1 and amendments 9 to 17, which stand in my name and in the name of my hon"
1252," On that basis, we have tabled new clause 1 and our other amendments in a positive spirit, to continue the dialogue that we had at the earlier stages of the Bill, because we support it and want it to work as effectively as possible"
1253," Predictability and consistency will be vital if those businesses are to have faith in the system, so   our new clause 1 would require the Secretary of State to conduct a review of awards to assess whether clauses 15 and 16 have been interpreted consistently"
1254," Clause 9 establishes a sixmonth period for a tenant or landlord to make a reference to arbitration, for which the clock starts on the day on which the Act is passed"
1255, Amendment 10 reflects the suggestion by Bill Chandler of Hill Dickinson LLP  that the date for referrals to open be fixed as 25 March 2022 irrespective of whether the legislation is passed
1256, Could the Minister update the House on those discussions Clause 19 gives the Secretary of State the discretion to specify ceilings for arbitration fees in secondary legislation
1257," Given the concerns of stakeholders and the financial pressures they are facing, the Secretary of State should be required to set a limit on arbitration fees, and that is the intention of amendment 16"
1258," That is why we have tabled amendment 17, which would remove this arbitrary cutoff date"
1259," The Governments impact assessment assumes 8,200 cases going to arbitration in its central scenario"
1260, The intention of amendment 13 is to make that an explicit and ongoing duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that the arbitral bodies appointed have sufficient numbers of arbitrators to hear and report on all cases as quickly as possible
1261, The British Retail Consortium estimated in December that 80% to 90% of its members had reached agreement
1262," That is why our amendment 14 revises clause 11 and requires a formal proposal to be accompanied by all evidence relevant to the proposal, whether helpful to that party or not"
1263," Although a 5050 split is fair in most cases, it is right that the arbitrator has the power to change how the arbitration fees are split, particularly if one party has acted unreasonably"
1264," That is why we have tabled amendment 12, which would provide the arbitrator with the power to make an adverse cost award, where one party has caused the other to incur costs by acting unreasonably"
1265," While clause 17 requires the arbitrator to make their award within 14 days  in a case in which an oral hearing is held, where no oral hearing is held the arbitrator is required to make their award as soon as reasonably practicable"
1266, Labours amendment 15 intends to ensure that awards are made within a specific timeframe irrespective of whether there is an oral hearing
1267,"Amendments made 19, page 16, leave out lines 14 and 15"
1268," The rest of clause 302 which provides that Part 4 of the Bill extends to the whole of the UK is reproduced in Amendment 20, so the whole of clause 302 can be omitted"
1269," Indeed, the Bills impact assessment notes that, according to the Treasury analysis, the total amount of deferred rent liabilities may be at around £9 billion by March 2022"
1270," UKHospitality found that the average hospitality venue lost over £10,000 in the weeks leading up to Christmas, with Christmas day takings down 60% compared with those in 2019"
1271," A December surveythe period between some of the stages of the Billby the Night Time Industries Association found that the outstanding business debt from their members was, on average, around over £200,000 per unit"
1272," That is why we have had a package of £750 million of support for charities, which indicates their importance and how they have been involved throughout the pandemic"
1273," One of them will be in procurement, which is worth £300 billion a year to our economy"
1274," Bearing in mind the Prime Ministers distant relationship with the truth, will the Minister outline exactly how the public, and Covid19 Bereaved Families for Justice, can have any faith in this inquiry at all"
1275," However, I am very pleased to say that in November 2019, the public prosecutors office in Bahrain announced the release of 75 prisoners, most of whom claimed that they were in prison for political reasons, so it is not true that socalled political prisoners have not been released"
1276, I also saw a large noticeboard in the police headquarters that seemed to have well over 100 photographs of young policemen and quite a few policewomen who had been murdered by terrorists
1277," During Bahrains popular prodemocracy uprising 11 years ago, the regime demolished 38 Shia Muslim mosques"
1278," Following that attack, 64 political prisoners were forcibly disappeared for 19 days and held incommunicado for between 30 and 36 days, during which time they were unable to contact their families or their lawyers, in a flagrant violation of both national and international law"
1279, It is to the credit of Lewis Hamilton and others that they used their substantial media presence to highlight human rights abuses in Bahrain when they were there for the Formula 1 race
1280," The best response of Formula 1 would be to say that it will refuse to go countries where there are significant human rights abuses, rather than expecting drivers individually to make such statements"
1281," Over the last five years, we have seen the cyber sector grow significantly, with more than 1,400 businesses generating revenues of £8"
1282,"9 billion last year alone, and supporting 46,700 skilled jobs"
1283," That is also why we are targeting key sectors as part of that strategy, such as through the CyberFirst programme, which will ensure that 6,500 pupils from 600 schools can benefit, in particular by attracting girls into that competition so that they are a part of the cyberstrategy"
1284," They should be subject to the normal rules that the rest of us expect, with an accountable police force, a transparent legal system and prison conditions that do not allow torture or force 12 people into a very small cell, which itself is a torture"
1286, It is of equal importance that the debate gives us the opportunity to question the Government and ask once again why they continue to turn a blind eye to human rights abuses in Bahrain while sending millions of pounds of taxpayers cash to the Gulf state via the highly secretive Gulf strategy fund
1287, A freedom of information request by the Scottish National party revealed that the Gulf strategy fund was increased by 145% last year
1288," Arguably, the most urgent of these cases is that of Dr alSingace, the 59yearold academic and human rights activist who was initially detained in 2010, having returned from speaking at a conference in the House of Lords"
1289," In October last year, 46 parliamentarians signed an open letter to the Foreign Secretary asking her to intervene on behalf of Dr alSingace and his family, but I am sorry to say that nothing has been done and the Government have remained largely silent"
1290," Another case worthy of highlighting is that of 74yearold Hassan Mushaima, the former leader of Bahrains opposition, who is also serving a life sentence, having been jailed in the aftermath of the prodemocracy uprising in 2011"
1291," In December, Ali held his own hunger strike outside the Bahraini embassy here in London for 23 days, demanding the release of all political prisoners, including his father"
1292," Of the 26 people awaiting execution in Bahrain, no fewer than 12 have been convicted of political charges"
1293, A recent report by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy and Reprieve found that executions in Bahrain have increased by a factor of 10 since the UK began its financial assistance through the integrated activity fund in 2017
1294," We draw on 100 years of probation experience, for example, and we are using it to encourage and support Bahrainiled judicial reform"
1295," To date, more than 3,600 individuals have had potential prison time replaced by alternative sentences, and further cases remain under consideration by the judiciary"
1296, I remind the House that more than 90 security personal have been prosecuted or face disciplinary action because of investigations carried out by human rights oversight bodies that the UK Government support
1297," We have heard much about Mr alSingace this afternoon, a 59yearold academic languishing in prison following his peaceful opposition to Bahrains dictatorship during the 2011 Arab spring"
1298, I fully support earlyday motion 578 calling for the UK Government to impose Magnitsky sanctions on those responsible for the unlawful imprisonment of Dr alSingace
1299," It is even more curious that, while the UK Government were cutting humanitarian aid by billions last year, including for clean water and nutrition, their support for the Gulf strategy fund, the former integrated activity fund, increased by 154%"
1300," However, while the pressure for such an inquiry grows, the fund continues to operate, despite billions of pounds of cuts to international aid spending by this Government"
1301, I hope to meet Bahraini authorities and FCDO officials in the coming months and encourage colleagues to sign earlyday motion 835 on human rights in Bahrain to express our collective concern about the situation and support a true path to reform
1302," At Christmas, I delivered hampers of fresh local produce to over 100 veterans across the Workington constituency to thank them for their service"

1304," There are currently about 1,500 political prisoners in the small kingdom, according to the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy"
1305," I would say that Muslim women in particular experience a triple whammy of race, faith and gender, and Tell MAMA has told us of the 40% increase in abuse against Muslim women during the lockdown"
1306," Polling by Compassion in Politics shows that more than 80% of social media users would provide evidence to get verified accounts, and making verified accounts the default optionnot the only optionwould help to stop some of the abuse"
1307," He was just 13 when he died, and he had his whole life ahead of him"
1308, None of those 11 platforms took down that content
1309," They are always looking for the next chink in our digital armour, so I am glad that paragraph 186 of the report makes it clear that we need to act on the human consequences of online fraudnot just the financial  effects, but the psychological effects"
1310, I welcome the recommendations that clause 414 be amended to add an offence of fraud and similarly that related clauses be introduced or amended so that companies are required to address it proactively
1311," As such, I support the Committees recommendations in paragraphs 268 to 271 of the report, which would bring such advertising into scope"
1312," The reason for all this is cynically simple the more that people view this content and stay on the platform, the more advertisements that the big tech companies are able to sell, and 99% of Facebooks income is from advertising"
1313,"Relevant documents Epetition 575833, Make verified ID a requirement for opening a social media account, and epetition 332315, Ban anonymous accounts on social media; oral evidence taken before the Petitions Committee on 21 May and 2 July 2020, and 2, 16 and 23 November, and 1 December 2021, on Tackling Online Abuse, HC 364 Session 201921 and HC 479"

1315," According to the dating app Bumble, 48% of millennial women said they had been sent an unsolicited sexual image in the last year alone"
1317," For many of us in this House it was troubling that the Government in 2019 abandoned part 3 of the Digital Economy Act 2017, leaving children with no protection online"
1318," In the interim, the Government must implement part 3 of the 2017 Act, and then the design code and this Bill can be used to offer greater protection"
1319, Even fines of £50 million are not significant against Facebooks gross revenue of more than £29 billion
1320," Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe Damian Collins, its Chairman, has done excellent work on this, particularly in pages 58 to 60 and 75 to 79 of the report"
1321," Up to 40% of all crime is now fraud and, as the report says, 85% of fraud involves the internet in some way or other, so it is crucial that we cover this in the Bill"
1322," It needs to be covered under clause 414 and priority illegal content, so that platforms have to be proactive in taking this stuff down"
1323, We also need to be looking at clause 39 and removing paidfor ads to make sure that platforms are also proactive in removing paidfor online fraudulent content
1324," I say murderer and terrorist, because it was accepted in court that Joe McCann had shot 15 soldiers"
1325," 10 all consecutively and repeatedly blamed each other, to me personally and in the newspapers, and not a single word of progress was made"

1335,152
1336," As I said, my constituent Joe, a popular young person, was 23, so the fact that he was over 18 did not mean that he was safe from this kind of harmful online content"
1337," I am pleased to see that that matches up with the report, but I appreciate that there is a difference of opinion on whether clause 11 should remain"
1338,"I congratulate the Joint Committee on an excellent report, consisting of 191 pages of wellresearched, balanced, temperate and intelligent analysis and recommendations"
1339," An estimated 86% of fraud is committed onlineAction Fraud has told us that victims of pensionsrelated scams who had worked their whole lives to build a retirement fund had lost £82,000 on averageOnline platforms, such as search engines and social media platforms, are playing an increasingly significant role in putting consumers at risk of harm by exposing them to adverts for financial productsFraudsters have unprecedentedly cheap access to an online population of consumers who find it difficult to differentiate genuine offers from the fraudulentThere are ads online for firms that dont exist, for firms that claim to be regulated but arent, for firms that claim to be based in the UK but arent and for clones of legitimate authorised firms"
1340, The public certainly want that; Aviva has published research concluding that 87% of the public want the Government to legislate to stop search engines and social media platforms promoting financial scams through advertising
1341," It will be years before that work delivers, and in the meantime thousands will have lost their life savings and UK financial services will have suffered further damage"

1343,7 billion lost in fraudulent scams in the past year resulted from cyberenabled frauds

1350, One of the children in a primary 7 class in a QA asked me what was the difference between Northern Ireland today and the Northern Ireland in which I spent the early years of my life
1351," Friend, whom I have heard speak on this many times over the years, is right that those who went to Northern Ireland to serve Queen and country, to uphold the rule of law, and to resist a brutal, barbaric campaign of Irish republican terror did so courageously, and it is wrong that they should now be hauled through processes for events some of which are 40, 45 years old or even older"
1352,"It was so good to hear the Paymaster General praising civil servants, so could he please explain why the Foreign Secretary overruled civil servants advice and went to a £3,000 lunch in a private members club owned by a Tory donor, and he calls that abiding by the code Will the Paymaster General immediately include that in the investigation being undertaken into the other boozy parties in No"

1363, He was convicted of 16 counts of downloading indecent photographs of children
1364, 56
1365," Friend the Member for StokeonTrent Central Jo Gideon said, these amendments would permanently bar, for example, an individual from standing for local office if, perhaps, at 18 they had had a glass of wine too many and were convicted of being slightly over the limit"
1366," New clause 3 may have been supported by the Chancellor in his foreword when he was serving in this role, but he is not the Bill MinisterI amand I believe that Bills such as this should be specific, targeted and focused"
1367, Amendments 1 and 4 would selectively remove parish councils from the list of local authorities subject to the new disqualification criteria
1368," Parish councils are already subject to the existing disqualification criteria, and rightly so, as there are 10,000 parish councils and approximately 100,000 parish councillors in England"
1369," I should clarify that the 2017 consultation responses regarding the matter of sexual risk orders were mixed some 39% of respondents were in favour of prohibition, and 45% were against"
1371," Perhaps inevitably when there are 120,000 councillors serving all tiers of local government in England, however, there are rare occasions when the behaviour of individuals falls below the standards that the public rightly expect"
1372, Why should people who are in that position be allowed to continue as councillors while other councillors who have been convicted of a different set of antisocial offences are excluded That is the essence of new clause 1
1373," The new clause is particularly topical, because it fits in with the 10year drugs plan to cut crime and save lives, which Her Majestys Government published in December 2021"
1374," So can we tolerate a situation in which local councillors may themselves have been convicted of offences against the Misuse of Drugs Act, in complete defiance of the Governments strategy, which I think has universal support across the country That is the essence of new clause 2"
1375," In the response to the consultation, they say that 65% of respondents agreed with that proposalthe proposal to disqualify, for such behaviour, from being able to be a councillor, 22% were against and 12% of people did not know"
1376," I submit, with all modesty, that new clause 3 has support at the very highest levels of Government from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as we have not heard anything from him to suggest that he has changed his mind since 2018"
1377," Now we are at that stage, why can we not accept new clause 3 The other amendments I have fit in with what I have just been saying"
1378, of an offence under Schedule 3 or Schedule 5 of the 2003 Act but who is nevertheless thought to pose a risk of harm to the public in the UK andor children or vulnerable adults abroad
1379," When we hear from the Minister that the Bill will apply to 100,000 councillors, one can see that this is an issue of significance"

1392,"We have already seen the loss of hundreds of jobs of BBC journalists involved in the muchvalued regional news and current affairs programming, including the excellent Inside Out programme"
1393," Tens of thousands of people supported getting rid of the BBC licence fee and very few were against it, so may I thank the Secretary of State for coming to the House today and making a statement If my Bill is of any use to her, I would be very happy to change in Committee any of the stuff I have there at the moment"
1394,"As I said, when the new model starts in 202728, many of us may not even be herewe are talking six years away"
1395, I am not going to conflate Channel 4 with the BBC; I am here to talk about the settlement of the licence fee
1396," The BBC, with the billions of pounds of funding£23 billionit is receiving, will still be able to meet its core mission and purposes"
1397, It is worth making the point that the BBC will continue to receive billions of pounds of public support and funding between now and 2027
1398," Gentleman talks about £159, but the BBC wanted it to project to £180"
1399,"The licence fee settlement ensures that the BBC can continue to meet its mission and its purposes, and it will continue to receive billions of pounds of funding£23 billion over the licence fee settlement period"
1400, Gentleman was going to thank me for the additional £7
1401,5 million that we are giving to S4C
1402," I thought he was going to thank us for the fact that S4Cs funding, having been frozen for the past five years, is now being increased and we are freezing the BBCs funding"
1403," To enable us to do that, we have recruited 40 new caseworkers, with 35 more in the pipeline for the coming months"

1410,"The House divided Ayes 234, Noes 328"
1411, Gentleman talks about extending the franchise to 16 and 17yearolds
1412," Does he agree, therefore, that extending the franchise to 16 and 17yearolds, who will go on to develop a far stronger commitment to voting, will actually strengthen our democracy against foreign interference in British politics"
1413," 15, Q13"
1414," We know that 16 and 17yearolds, when given the chance, take it very seriously"
1415," In Scotland and Wales, they have higher rates of turnout than 18 to 24yearolds, with 75% voting and 97% saying that they would vote in future elections"
1416," There has been success in Northern Ireland and voting turnout has increased, but the statistics also show that 98% of voters already have sufficient ID in place for voting, and we are almost there"
1417," All we need is for the other 2% to be done, and Northern Ireland will achieve that goal of having everybody with an ID"
1418," There will be no time limit, but he must resume his seat no later than 8"
1419,55
1420," Friend for going through the implications of new clause 11, which I very much welcome"

1422, Friends tabled the last time these matters were discussed in this place considered shortening campaigns to 25 days
1423," We have to finish this stage of the Bill at 9 oclock, so I shall immediately impose a time limit of five minutes"
1424,"If the 75% of 16 and 17yearolds who voted in the Scottish independence referendum did not make their own choice, who voted for them If the research that says that they looked for and discovered the facts and made their own choice is not true, who does the hon"
1425, A far higher proportion voted in that group than in the 18to24 age group
1426," I know that he and the Scottish National party do not want to raise the age of marriage to 18; the Scottish Executive have not made it clear so far, but I think they should"
1427," Article 1 in part 1 of the UN convention on the rights of the child says that a child is a child until 18 years of age, so I do not understand why the SNP is still backing child marriage"
1428,"With regard to voter participation among 16 and 17yearolds in Scotland, another reason we have such a healthy turnout is that all the elections in which they participate are conducted on a proportional basis"
1429," That is why, Madam Deputy Speaker, I very much hope that you might allow me the chance to test the opinion of the House on new clause 13"
1430," Even where nonphotographic ID was used in the trials and given to everyone, about 1% of people were turned away just because they had forgotten to take it from their house to the polling station"

1435," Does the Secretary of State agree that 43p a day is value for money for BBC iPlayer, BBC Sounds and the BBC World Service"
1436,"I wish the Secretary of State would stop with the crocodile tears about the costofliving crisis, because £159 is a lot of money, particularly for my constituents, but it happens to be exactly the same amount, on average, as they will pay in extra national insurance from April this year"
1437," She says that the BBC gets lots of money, but Sky got five times as much money this year, and its revenues this year increased by 18"
1438,I think there were about 30 questions in that statement so I will address the top points
1439," Whether getting by on minimum wage or on a multimillionpound presenters salary, we fork out the same amount of money"
1440," Do not be under any illusions the BBC will continue to receive billions of pounds, even under this settlement"
1441, It will get £23 billion of public money over the course of the charter to 2027
1442,"The BBC, as I have said, will continue to receive billions of poundsworth of funding, and it will continue to meet its mission and core purpose, but I cannot dictate how it spends its money and I do not have editorial control"

1444,5 million per annum from the licence fee to support its digital investment
1445," In total, S4C will be provided with approximately £88 million in licencefee funding per annum"
1446," We are committed to S4C, and we are providing it with additional funding"
1447,Many of us find it nauseating that the Secretary of State has come here to talk about hardpressed families when she supported the £20 cut to universal credit
1448," So could we test how much she considered some of these factors, perhaps in the style of the broadcast media How much more money is generated by the investment in the BBC Is it £1, £2 or £3 She talks about the north"
1449," How much of the BBCs economic impact is beyond London Is it 10%, 20% or 50% Perhaps she could demonstrate her knowledge at least of the BBCs impact"

1452," Perhaps the most infamous example is the Democratic Unionist partys £435,000 donation to Vote Leave, which was channelled via a UA, the Constitutional Research Council"
1453," It was consequently fined just £6,000a penalty totalling little more than 1% of its donations, which could well simply be seen as the cost of doing business"
1454, Those clubs have given well over £1 million to the Conservatives
1455," New clause 18 would quite simply require unincorporated associations that meet the threshold for registration with the Electoral Commission to conduct checks to establish whether a person donating for political purposes is a permissible donor and, if not, to reject that donation as the Committee on Standards in Public Life has recommended"
1456,"I rise to speak to new clause 16, in my name and that of Members from four of the parties represented here in Westminster"
1457,"EU and the mysterious source of his gigantic loans from Rock Servicesor was it Rock Holdings Thanks to evidence given to Carole Cadwalladr and the heroic reporting of The Guardian, we know that there are all kinds of interesting and no doubt innocent connections, such as the fact that Mr Bankss wife, Katya Banks, was given entry into the country on a passport serially numbered to a passport given to someone who MI5 reported as a Russian spy"
1458," Let us take another honourable donor, Mr Mohamed Amersi, a man who together with his partner has given   nearly £800,000 to good causes and who, it would seem, might qualify for a walkon part in John le Carrs The Night Manager, but not as Jonathan Pine"
1459," The point is that I can raise questions here that warrant further investigationquestions about, for example, Lubov Chernukhin, the model of generosity who has given the Conservatives £2"
1460,"1 million, £1"
1461,9 million of it after her husband Vladimirthe same Vladimir who was appointed by Mr Putins deputy chairman of Vnesheconombankreceived money from Suleiman Kerimov

1465," Amendments 1 and 5 would remove from the Bill the voter identification provisions, which are said to protect our democracy by requiring people to have photographic identification in order to vote, so as to prevent personation"
1466," In 2019, 59 million votes were cast and there was a single conviction for voter personation"
1467,"I have significant issues with new clause 13, as drafted, which simply asks to introduce a proportional system"
1468, I am also a strong believerthis speaks to new clause 5 in the name of the hon
1469," It allows a person to call up any and every local authority to say that they were resident in the area 30 or 40 years ago, provide flimsy proofit will not be photo identification, that is for sureand then be able to donate massive sums of money"
1470," New clause 2 would simply prevent anyone registered as such an overseas elector from donating to political parties in the UK, while new clause 9 would require individual and company donors to be based in the UK while making those in charge of companies liable for any offences caused"
1471, We also have new clause 16 tabled by my right hon
1472, The Bill takes away the barriers that kept it at £1 million
1473," The strength of feeling on the issue is shown by the variety of other new clauses2, 8, 16 and 18that cover that subject"
1474, Amendment 3 would remove those provisions
1475," Similarly, we will support amendments 11 and 12, which delete parts of this provision"
1476," However, the sheer volume of changes and changed directions in the Bill is a sign of how halfbaked it started"
1477,"Despite the fact that the removal of the free licence for the over75s was a result of her own partys actions, the Secretary of States tweet yesterday indicated that her  attack on the BBC was due to the over75s being threatened with prison sentences and bailiffs knocking on their doors"

1484, We lose 2 million voters and that is the snapshot they use to propose a boundary change to reduce the number of MPs to 600

1487," Despite the highest election turnout in 120 years, the big lie has been amplified that Trump actually won in 2020"

1489, I urge all Members who value our democracy to support amendment 1
1490," With that in mind, I put particular focus on new clause 11 and new schedule 1, which have been put forward by the Government"
1491, That information would then be published on the returning officers statement of persons nominated by virtue of Rule 143A

1493," The proposal would still demonstrate locality but would protect candidates from the Hobsons choice of being outside the constituency, albeit by 100 yards, or having to display their full postal address"
1494," This is also similar to new clause 10, tabled by the hon"
1495," Imposing a paltry £20,000 fine has been shown to be no deterrent whatsoever"

1508,Is there any truth in the reports that the Government want to have asylum seekers processed offshore in countries such as Gambia Has any such country actually agreed to this Does the Secretary of State accept that having people processed hundreds or thousands of miles away might meet the letter of our obligations to asylum seekers but certainly does not meet the spirit

1526,"When the BBC came before the Public Accounts Committee, it was striking how unambitious its target was for growing commercial revenues, which represent just 6% of its current income"
1527," Given the millions across the United Kingdom and abroad who do love the BBC, there must be countless options for future funding models for content that can be commercialised, but does my right hon"
1528,"Will the Secretary of State say what impact assessment she has done of the impact that the change will have on households if fees were increased What will be the impact on services provided by the BBC as a consequence of these freezes to its income, on top of the 31% that it has had cut from its income over the past 10 years How will that affect the services provided by the BBC, and how will they survive her plans for the BBC"

1531,"It is billions of pounds, and I do not believe that any family receiving repeated letters, or a bailiff knocking on their door, or a request to appear at a magistrates court would think it is value for money, because it is money they cannot afford"
1532," The issue is that working families and people who are hard pressed in the current situation of rising inflationary pressures think it is difficult to pay £159 a year out of their income, which is why we are freezing the licence fee for the next two years and not allowing it to rise"

1543," That makes it 184,000 to one; this is racking up faster than Downing Street parties"
1544," The Cabinet Office itself says that that approach will exclude 2% of the electorate without the right form of ID, but according to the Electoral Commission the actual figure of those without the right ID will be between 1 million and 3"
1545," Some 77% of people in the UK hold a full driving licence, whereas the figure for black people is 53% and the one for Asian people is 61%"

1555, I just sat on a private Members Bill Committee on increasing the age at which people can get married from 16 to 18 in England
1556," Who is making that decision The argument was made, and basically accepted by the Opposition, that 16 and 17yearolds are not making it themselves"

1647," Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen Royston Smith in this parliamentary year and the one before, we would not have got this far and, on behalf of 1 million leaseholders in all parts of England and Wales, may I say that we are grateful for their efforts Will they please keep going"
1648,"I would like to thank the Minister on behalf of a number of leaseholders around the country, because our amendments asked for only 25 years and the Government have gone further with 30 years"
1649, Gentleman will have seen that in the net zero strategy we have set out a plan for an extra £90 billion of investment from the private sector
1650,"The Defective Premises Act has been in effect since 1972, so there is a significant body of case law that those wishing to bring an action, and indeed the courts, will be able to refer to, to determine whether a premises is defective and therefore whether an action should be successful"
1651," The new clause will be inserted into Part 5, after clause 137"
1652, The proposal to make developers pay £4 billion for cladding removal in buildings under 18 metres is unclear on how quickly developers will be asked to pay and what measures the Government will take if they refuse
1653, Does the Minister think it is right that social landlords have paid millions more than developers to fix the building safety scandal at the cost of delivering new social homes I hope that we will see urgent action to appease concerns raised by leaseholders and Members across the House and to allay genuine concerns that it is one rule for council and social landlords and another for the Governments developer friends
1654,"1 The power to make regulations under section 1316b is exercisable by statutory instrument, in the case of regulations made by the Secretary of State or the Welsh Ministers"
1655, Every single community is affected up and down the country; there are millions of leaseholders
1656," In some ways, it does not really matter what our opinions are in this place; what matters is what we deliver for those millions of leaseholders up and down the country, so that they do not face bankrupting bills and huge mental health issues"
1657,1 The Architects Act 1997 is amended as follows
1658," Friend is right a whole range of commitments were made, some of which will continue beyond the end of 2022"
1659," As I said, a key commitment was for countries to revisit their emissionsreduction targets by the end of 2022"
1660," House buyers need to have confidence in the safety and quality of their homes, which is why the Scottish Government support the principle of the new homes ombudsman scheme proposed in part 5 of the Bill"
1661, It is essential for part 5 to acknowledge and respect the devolution settlement
1662," We are four and a half years on from Grenfell, and every single day that passes without the situation being resolved puts enormous strain on our constituents"
1663,"We have less than three quarters of an hour left, so I will have to impose an initial time limit of four minutes on BackBench speeches"
1664," The management company, YY, is in the process of taking the leaseholders to a firsttier tribunal to award costs, adding a 5% commission"
1665,"I fully support Labours new clause 3 and if there is a vote on it, I will be supporting it, particularly as subsection 6 would protect the small buytolet landlords the right hon"
1666," Gentleman knows, the scheme in Wales will be administered by the Welsh Government, so may I take it and inform my constituents that new clause 3 will be the basis of the scheme that we see apply to Wales, where Labour is in government"
1667," Does he agree that there is a requirement to move with haste A constituent of mine who has contacted me is facing a bill of £25,000, with a demand for £5,000 by the end of this month, so the Government really need to move very quickly"
1668," As well as providing for the establishment of a building works agency, which we believe remains necessary if the Government are to ensure that the pace of remediation across the country is accelerated and that works are properly carried out  and certified, our new clause 3 seeks to provide the maximum legal protection possible for leaseholders facing potential costs to fix historic cladding and noncladding defects, irrespective of circumstance"
1669," Members for Stevenage and for Southampton, Itchen, does the same and we fully support it, as well as their new clauses 5 and 6"
1670," We will seek to divide on new clause 3 today, simply to reinforce to the other place the importance we attach to the issue of leaseholder protection, but we do want to work constructively with the Government on this matter in the period ahead, in the light of the change of tone and approach signalled by the Secretary of State last week"
1671," We are asking for the VAT to be scrapped, because when the Treasury puts forward £5 billion, £1 billion of it will be going back to the Treasury automatically; the frustration is understandable"
1672," Another example we give is how a previous defects Actthe Defective Premises Act 1972could be used, as it was for properties with prefabricated concrete"
1673," For example, I have a property in my constituency, Vista Towerone of the famous propertieswhere the remediation costs are £15 million for 73 flats"
1674," The leaseholders paid £200,000 for their flats, and their remediation costs are £212,000, so hon"
1675," The mortgage companies are losing money, and that was before the leaseholders got into paying over £300,000 for waking watch and all the other interim costs that have added to the bills"
1676," For that particular property, with the announcement that the Secretary of State made, leaseholders costs went from £200,000 down to £60,000"
1677," We are not there yet, but we are very close to getting there and supporting millions of constituents up and down the country"
1678, Lady is a doughty campaigner on behalf of her constituents in the Roundway and elsewhere
1679, The Bill Committee debated section 1 of the Defective Premises Act 1972 in significant detail; I recall that the hon

1682,"3 million homes in the UK at risk of flooding, without any property flood resilience measures"
1683," Without positive action from the Government, tens of thousands more homes will be built without the protection they need"
1684," It was the result of two years of marathon work and a twoweek sprint of negotiations, following which the world can creditably say that we have kept within reach the goal of limiting global warming to 1"
1685,5 above preindustrial levels
1686, But to keep 1
1687,"5 alive, commitments must be translated into action"
1688,"As the Chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee knows, all countries have committed to come back to their 2030 emissionsreduction targets by 2022, if necessary"
1689," Of course, the G20 is responsible for 80% of global emissions and will have to lead the way"
1690," Does the COP President agree that the lesson is not that, as some in his party would say, we are moving too fast on green energy, but the opposite we are moving too slowly and our dependence on fossil fuels leaves us vulnerable The only way, therefore, to keep 1"
1691,5 alive and provide energy security is to go further and faster on the climate transition
1692,"Consumers looking at their energy bills will ask, If it is going so well, why are our bills rocketing and why are we so vulnerable We can keep 1"
1693,5 alive only if we have an energy policy that is fair at home and abroad
1694," Many of the fossil fuel companies have made billions as a result of soaring prices, yet the Government say we should not tax them further because they are struggling"
1695,"Our young people have led the fight for tougher climate change pledges, so the world at least does not breach 1"
1696,5 of warming
1697," To support their activism, Scotland recently hosted the UN Climate Change Conference of Youth ahead of COP26, has unveiled almost £1 million for a programme for young people in the climate conference and legacy activities, and has signed up to the UNICEF declaration on children, youth and climate change, along with countries such as Norway, the Netherlands and Peru"

1699,5 degrees Celsius remains achievable

1701, The new Schedule is intended to replace clauses 104 to 113 and be inserted after Schedule 6
1702,"That the draft Data Protection Act 2018 Amendment of Schedule 2 Exemptions Regulations 2022, which were laid before this House on 10 December 2021, be approved"

1705,"New clause 2 and amendment 1, which stand in my name and are kindly supported by the hon"
1706," That is exactly what happened at Wessex Foods in Lowestoft 11 years ago, in July 2011"
1707," I should therefore be grateful if the Minister gave serious consideration to accepting new clause 2 and amendment 1, so that the Building Act can be amended to provide for the protection of property"

1709, A British standard already exists that reduces falls by a staggering 60% British Standard 53951
1710," The Government will argue that our focus should be outcomebased rather  than legislating on method, but I might point to regulation 7 of the building regulations, on combustible materials, which is in itself descriptive and sets out how the industry must achieve that particular regulation"
1711," If the outcome that we are all aiming for is safety of stairs, then the status quo is simply not working, and hundreds of people are dying every year from something that could so easily be prevented I refer back to the 60% figure"
1712,"I rise to speak in support of new clauses 1, 2, 15, 16 and 23"
1713," Friend the Member for Sheffield South East Mr Betts,  and amendment 1, tabled by the hon"
1714," As he will no doubt be aware, concerns were raised that the plans for Ballymores proposed 51storey development in Cuba Street in my constituency included only a single fire escape for a building that would have been two and half times the height of Grenfell tower"
1715," Not only landlords of highrise blocks but social landlords and resident leaseholders need to do this, and the cost is estimated to be about £30 a year per flat"
1716," Less than a year before Grenfell, in August 2016, there was a very serious fire, less than 1 mile from where Grenfell Tower stands, at Shepherds Courtan 18storey blockin my constituency"
1717, Some 5
1718,"5 million of that particular type of faulty washerdryer were manufactured, and hundreds if not thousands of fires across the country, some obviously in highrise buildings, have been caused by that"
1719," Indeed, over half53%of all accidental dwelling fires are caused by electrical sources of ignition"
1720," I will first deal briefly with several of the nonGovernment amendments selected, before taking the opportunity to ask the Minister several specific questions relating to  Government new clause 19, new schedule 1 and various other amendments relating to special measures and protections against forfeiture"
1721, This directly relates to our previous debate on part 5
1722," No provisions prohibiting forfeiture would be necessary if the House had accepted any amendment, whether it be new clause 3, new clause 13 or potential forthcoming Government amendments, that provides sufficiently robust legal protection for leaseholders in all circumstances"
1723, Proposed new paragraph 9 is a new provision that provides for a financial management proposal
1724," 11, 12, 16 to 28, 31 and 32, 36, 40, 61, 63 and 70are consequential amendments that make changes relating to special measures due to the provisions now appearing in new schedule 1"
1725," Four technical amendments are consequential to amendment 1, which I introduced earlier, relating to the new homes ombudsman"
1726," Amendments 66 and 67 adjust the territorial extent of the provisions about the new homes ombudsman scheme now that that the scheme will operate across Great Britain, and territorial extent issues are also dealt with in new schedule 2, which contains a consequential amendment related to the new homes ombudsman"
1727," Amendment 64 provides that the consequential amendments in schedule 5 relating to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967an Act we all know welland the Freedom of Information Act 2000 extend to all of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland"
1728, That left them facing bills for tens of thousands of pounds
1729, We know that is a problem in hundreds of buildings
1730,"It is nearly five years since the tragic events at Grenfell Tower, yet thousands of my constituents in Salford and Eccles still live in fear"
1731, Prospective suppliers bidding for contracts above £5 million a year must now have committed to the Governments target of net zero by 2050 and have published a carbon reduction plan
1732," Certainly, the provision of funds for cladding removal, the initial move on the ACM cladding, the £1 billion and the extension of the building safety fund to £5 billion have all been welcome"
1733," They were horrified to be told that FirstPort intends to recover the estimated £4,912,000 for repairs from the leaseholders if the application to the building safety fund is not successful"
1734," That will mean that constituents such as the single working mother who paid £60,000 for a 25% share of her property will be lumbered with a repair bill of £110,000"
1735," I have more than 1,000 constituents living in dangerous homes"
1736, It is time to enact in practice provisions that the House of Commons passed in lawineffectivelyin 2002
1737," Will he support me in asking the Government to get together with the technical sides of the insurance companies and the Competition and Markets Authority to get those insurance premiums back down to what they were before so that leaseholders may pay £300 a year to insure a building they do not own rather than £3,000 a year"
1738," That has been the case since August 2016 when there was a very serious fire at Shepherds Court in my constituency, which I spoke about earlier today"
1739," We have now had a recent announcement from the new Secretary of StateI hope I have understood this correctlythat there will be a request to private developers to provide £4 billion, with a veiled threat of enforcing that in some as yet unspecified way, in order to deal with buildings between 11 and 18 metres"
1740,I start by paying tribute to the many hundreds of Vauxhall residents who have contacted me in my short two years as Member of Parliament for Vauxhall
1741," At every stage of my continued efforts on behalf of Vauxhall leaseholders going through that anguish and uncertainty over the last two years, the Bill has been held up by the Government as the solution that would finally bring an end to this crisis"
1742, Where does that leave the millions of leaseholders caught up at various points along the way of that lengthy scandal What does the Bill do to empower leaseholders who had their assessment before the recent changes in Government policy and believe that unnecessary work has been recommended for their building Where is the help for leaseholders whose flats are unsellable until that remediation work is complete but who have been told that they will have to wait many years They are trapped
1743," As I suggested on Report, it is not preempting the Grenfell Tower inquirys conclusions to state that the horror of that dreadful June night in 2017 was the product not only of pernicious industry practice but of state failure a failure that involved successive Governments presiding over a deficient regulatory regime, and a failure to act on repeated and clear warnings about the potentially lethal consequences of that fact"
1744," When we started our campaign about 18 months ago, the Governments original offer was around £20 million to deal with these issues"
1745," After the statement from the Secretary of State last week, we are now on course to have more than £9 billion of Government support, with probably another £100 million for waking watch, alarms and a variety of other issues"
1746," Tonight, millions of leaseholders up and down the country, many with huge mental health issues and facing massive financial ruin, have hope"
1747, That hope encourages us to believe that we may finally come to a position where we can resolve things for those millions of leaseholders
1748," At Vista Tower in my constituency, which has more than £15 millionworth of remediation costs, the fire breaks are missing"
1749," With all the technical details, that campaign has demonstrated how complicated this issue is and the many millions of people and tens of thousands of buildings it affects in many different ways"
1750," Will the Government be prepared to provide support so that those leaseholders can take action against the original developers, or will the Government take the action on their behalf, because a lot of these leaseholders have been going through this for a number of years and no longer have the mental resilience or ability to take these fights on and take legal actions for the next five or 10 years in the courts Will the Minister provide further support to those leaseholders Will he agree to continue to meet and work with me so that we can ensure that leaseholders are not held responsible and they are the innocent parties throughout this crisis"
1751," In a modern liberal democracy, living in a home where you feel safe should be a basic human right, but sadly, for thousands of people up and down our country, this most reasonable of expectations does not tally with their current experience"
1752," This Bill is going to right that wrong by replacing an outdated building system with one that is attuned not just to where we are in 2021 but to how we protect people in 2031, 2041 and for many years beyond"
1753, Member for Vauxhall Florence Eshalomi; and many others who have worked so very hard to on behalf of their constituents to make sure that their concerns are addressed
1754,"I shall speak to Opposition new clause 3 and to the amendments that, although they will not be pressed to a vote this evening, would protect leaseholders from the costs of not only cladding removal, but the remediation of noncladding defects"
1755," It seems to me that someone who has profited from, for example, charging a building in my constituency an insurance premium of £700,000 in total, which has never come down, has some big questions to answer"
1756," First, around half of the buildings in my constituency that have difficulties associated with them have noncladdingrelated problems"
1757," Indeed, in Queens Wharf in Reading town centre, the building owners estimate that nearly £1 million of work needs to be carried out"
1758,"The principle that leaseholders should not have to pay for issues that are not their responsibility, as they bought properties in good faith, was first established in the Select Committee report in July 2018"
1759, Members who have been here long enough will remember that I took the Mesothelioma Act 2014 through this House
1760," Originally, we gave the victims 80% of the compensation that they would have got through the courts"
1761," Eventually, we gave them 100%"
1762," When we come to part 5, Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope to catch your eye again"
1763, This new clause amends Part XVI of the Housing Act 1985 originally enacted as the Housing Defects Act 1984 to empower the government and local authorities to designate dwellings with cladding and fire safety defects as defective and to provide grant support for remediation
1764, It places a timelimited duty on the Secretary of State to consider making designations under Part XVI of the Housing Act 1985 to provide funding for cladding and fire safety remediation and for Parliament to approve the plans for doing so
1765, Removing subsection 5 removes the material risk a court may construe clause 128 in a way that means it has no practical benefit and will lead to years of costly litigation for leaseholders
1766," This is the first group of amendments, new clauses and new schedules that relates to part 5 of the Bill"
1767, Members should not make general speeches about how they feel about the Bill at this point; this part of the proceedings very specifically relates to part 5
1768," Gentleman, suggest to the Government that between now and the House of Lords they consider taking a right to take the potential claims by the landlords on behalf of leaseholders into a public agency which can make a public claim against the developers, builders, architects, surveyors, building specification and building controllers, so that money can be brought back from those who were responsible, not the innocent leaseholders who are not"
1769," I have no intention of seeking to reprise them this afternoon, but before I turn to part 5 of the Bill and the consideration of the amendments related to it, I feel it is incumbent on me briefly to restate why we believe this legislation is so important"
1770," To the extent that the Bill delivers on the recommendations of Dame Judiths report, we remain supportive of it and want to see a version of it on the statute book as soon as possible, given that four and a half years have elapsed since the Grenfell tragedy; however, the House knows we have serious concerns about what is missing from the Bill, and particularly its failure as drafted to provide robust legal protection for leaseholders facing ruinous costsa point already made by several hon"
1771," The Minister should note that, with some minor tweaks, our new clause 3 would achieve that"
1773, New clause 21 makes sure that the devolved Administrations are not restricted from bringing forward legislation to alter the ombudsmans statutory functions in relation to that territorys future by disapplying a restriction in the Government of Wales Act 2006
1774," That is why we have proposed adding section 4B4 to the Limitation Act 1980 through clause 128, which will ensure that there is always a minimum amount of time to lodge a claim under section 1 of the Defective Premises Act for buildings whose limitation periods will be revived for a very short period of time"
1775," That means that those in any buildings completed between mid1992 and mid1993 will always have one full year in which to lodge their claim, once this Bill and its provisions apply"
1776," Friend the Member for Worthing West Sir Peter Bottomley, referred to the Defective Premises Act 1972"
1777," I would say to him that quite apart from the body of case law that exists with respect to the 1972 Act, and quite apart from the fact that even if a company has become defunct directors can still be held liable for the decisions made, as it were, on their watch, the challenges that he has described are the sorts of things that we will want to discuss in this place and in the other place, across parties, to ensure that such challenges are addressed"
1778, That means that the EU will now have a 25% price advantage over UK steel and aluminium exports to the US
1779,"At the start of last month, I wrote to the Secretary of State about those steel tariffs, which have been in place since 2018 and have already done great damage"
1780," In 2017, exports of steel and aluminium to the United States were more than 350,000 tonnes"
1781," The UK accounts for less than 1% of US steel and aluminium imports in volume terms, so UK imports do not affect the viability or the national security of the US steel or aluminium industries"
1782," It supplies thousands of subframes every day to motor  manufacturers worldwide, but it has outlined to me concerns that have been raised with it by European companies about the rules of origin and potential tariffs on goods supplied from the UK"
1783,"In her answer to the urgent question, the Minister mentioned the £286 million of aid that we are giving to Afghanistan"
1784," The amount has been doubled after being halved the previous year, which is fine, but in her response to another urgent question last week, the Minister confirmed that only half that money£145 millionhad actually been disbursed"
1785,"In addition to British Council staff, many of us have thousands of constituentsin my case, up to 150who have relatives and friends who have worked for the British in Afghanistan and who are in terrible need of resettlement to this country"
1786," That included over 8,000 British nationals, and close to 5,000 Afghans who loyally served the UKincluding British Council employeesalong with their dependants"
1787," We are coordinating closely with international partners, and have doubled our aid to Afghanistan for this financial year to £286 million, which will be used to provide the vital humanitarian assistance that will save lives this winter"
1788," As I set out earlier, we have doubled our aid for Afghanistan for this financial year to £286 million, which will be essential to providing humanitarian assistance for those most in need"
1789," The Government have already evacuated thousands of women and girlsfor instance, female judges, womens rights activists and a girls football team"
1790," We have doubled the aid for this financial year to £286 million, which will be used to ensure that we get that humanitarian assistance to those on the ground"
1791, More than 20 million people are facing the prospect of starvation in Afghanistan and the situation could not be more urgent
1792," In relation to the Ministers earlier responses, could she tell the House how much of the £286 million of aid promised in this financial year has been disbursed so far"
1793,"For every £490 of Brexit damage, CPTPP should recover about £8 of it, but that is at risk if the UK patent attorneys membership of the European Patent Organisation is undermined or removed"
1794, He is right it is an £8
1795,4 trillion market that we are opening up
1796," Friend is absolutely right; the pay for people working in those sectors is about 50% higher than the UK average, so the more jobs we can create in those growth sectors, the better"
1797,"9% of the businesses in his constituency that export will benefit from CPTPP, and I look forward to the day when he welcomes that"
1798, Friend the Member for Darlington Peter Gibson on the successful passage of his Bill a halfhour or so ago
1799," I fervently hope that  in half an hours time, I will be offering the same congratulations to my hon"
1800," Friend said in his speech today, 80% of crime that involves cautions or convictions involves repeat offences"
1801," Good intentions and strategies need to be backed up by Government investment, and nearly £900 million of additional funding is being put in over the next three years, which brings the total up to £3 billion"
1802," With more than 2,000 bed spaces, it is important for there to be a comprehensive drugs strategy for the approved premises estate"
1803," Members may be aware, around 80% of crime that receives a caution or conviction is committed by a repeat offender"
1804," Indeed, Dame Carol Blacks review of drugs estimated that the total cost of harms related to illicit drug use in England was more than £19 billion in 201718"
1805," Drugrelated crime was the main driver of the total costs, with recorded offences committed in England by drug users amounting to £9"
1806,3 billion in that period
1807," HMPPS estimates that when it implements the change in testing, it will cost approximately £1"
1808,2 million per year to carry out the enhanced testing regime with residents of approved premises
1809," The current annual budget for drug testing in approved premises is £350,000, so the implementation of this Bill would see an increase of some £850,000"
1810," However, it is worth bearing it in mind that the Ministry of Justice has indicated that it has evidence that shows that drug treatment provides a return to society of £4 for every £1 that is invested, and that increases to a return to society of £21 over a period of 10 years"
1811," Let us look at what the Mayor of London is doing an extra 1,300 police officers and £70 million for opportunities for disadvantaged young people"
1812," The reoffending rate for people using the London Womens Diversion Service, which the Mayor of London funds, is just 7% versus the national average of, I think, 23"
1813," Following over a decade of Tory Government, drug use in prisons has increased by 500%"
1814," There has been a 12% drop in inmates enrolling in drug and alcohol courses over the last four years, with fewer offenders taking these programmes"
1815, And what of the Justice Secretarys flagship programme of introducing £1 million Xray scanners in all mens prisons They are detecting only a quarter of the number of contraband items being found in manual checks by prison officers
1816," The perilous state of our prisons means that a third of adults released  from custody go on to reoffend within a year, costing the taxpayer £18 billion and meaning that we are less safe on our streets"
1817," Under clause 1 of the Bill, approved premises managers can authorised assisted premises staff to ask for and require a urine sample from any resident, rather than an oral fluid testa provision already in place elsewhere in the system"
1818, I was glad to hear reassurances during the Bill Committee that clause 1 also ensures that the first step will be to provide guidance and assistance for those found to have drugs or other illicit substances in their bodies
1819," It builds on the recommendations of the prisons and probation ombudsman, which in 2017 called for more effective drug testing practices and better staff guidance to identify and address the risks associated with substance misuse"
1820, The strategy is underpinned with total investment of £3 billion in combating drugs over the next three years
1821, A recent internal survey of approved premises staff found that more than 50% of them felt that prescription medication was a problem

1826, Limiting the noise to 90 dB and reviewing who can sell and use fireworks will go a long way to solving the issues faced by residents in Luton North and thousands of other people across the country
1827," Could this new power fall foul of article 8 of the European convention on human rights, and if so, what would be the consequences of this"
1828," Friend the Member for NewcastleunderLyme Aaron Bell who stewarded the Prisons Substance Testing Act 2021 through the House on behalf of Dame Cheryl Gillan, when it was in fact my hon"
1829, A Formula 1 race typically reaches 140 dB

1831, We will also be providing an additional £3

2466,5 billion items to protect our frontline workers
2467, The action we took protected thousands of frontline healthcare workers in the NHS and social care
2468, Gentleman should also be aware that the vast bulk of that £8
2469,7 billion is down to exactly the same reason PPE purchased at the height of the market
2470," Member for Worsley and Eccles South Barbara Keeley, who is no longer in her place, that a small proportion of this £8"

2924,"I know that the Secretary of State is as concerned as I am about children in my constituency reaching their full educational potential, but I am concerned that only 240,000 enrolled on the national tutoring programme in its first year, that it has only a third of the funding that his own Government adviser put forward for covid catchup and that funding per pupil will not reach 2010 levels for another three years"

2929," It is important that we celebrate this extremely important milestone for his constituency and for north Wales in general, so I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate and respond on behalf of the Government"
2930," One reason is the history that he went through; it has been fascinating to hear about the contribution that Shotton has made for so long, the deeply embedded history within the community and the opportunities that Shotton has had over a century and a quarter"

2936," Gentlemans steelworks began, but it closed overnight in 1883, and all the activity was moved up to Cumbria"

2945,2 million tons of black and galvanised sheets for various uses

2962," He will also appreciate that Electricity North West has done a reasonable job in restoring power to 95% of people affected, but clearly we want to work harder to make sure that those 6,000 or 7,000 people who are still off the grid can get their power back as soon as possible"

3003, The Budget is a clear statement of intent worldclass public services backed by £150 billion a year in cash terms
3004,"I am pleased that the Minister mentioned the opportunity to provide eight additional rebuilds of hospitals, because Stepping Hill Hospital has served the people of Stockport and surrounding areas well since it was built in 1905"
3005," However, all hospital buildings reach the end of their useful lives and, with a £40 million maintenance bill, that one certainly has"

3009," Friend, because his constituency is indeed receiving £20 million from the levellingup fund to deliver a new civic hub in Radcliffe, which will improve access to adult education while freeing up vital space for a new secondary school"
3010," Gentleman recall that we set out to try to simplify the code of conduct Does he think we are succeeding in simplifying Or, by adding more, are we perhaps being drawn dangerously into a zerosum game, where rules beget rules and more rules beget more rules in an effort to try to clarify, and in fact making it more complicated I particularly draw attention to section 8 of the report, on Training, advice and promotion"
3011,"Regarding Russia, when I was in Bosnia as part of the United Nations protection force, a Russian man called Victor Andreev was very much part of the headquarters"
3012," It seems that one of the problems, which has got worse since  my first visit in 2003 and my second in 2013, is that much as we would want to create a multiethnic, multidenominational constitution and structure, a lot of peoples daily lives are spent in a separate silo"
3013,"I was a young captain in 1997, when I deployed on my very first tour to Bosnia"
3014," I also spent time in Banja Luka, which was then the headquarters of the multinational division that was entrusted with enforcing the peace and the Dayton agreement"

3018, I deployed in 1997
3019," Why Because Dodiks rhetoric is separatist, and he has vowed to sever the legal and tax systems and the army in the Serbrun half of the country"
3020, Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton said that we are repeating the same mistakes as we did in the early 1990s
3021," It is stoking the ethnic tensions and encouraging the separatists and the breakup of the state, because I imagine Putin regards it as in his national interest to see 1"
3022,8 million Bosnian refugees flooding into Europe when western Europe is already facing a refugee crisis
3023," I agree with the suggestion that we should support the current headquarters in Bosnia with NATO troops, or even troops of support of the EU; it does not really matter, but an enhanced British presence in the headquarters and possibly on the ground is necessary to give us the eyes and the ears that we need"
3024, I deployed in 1997 to do peace enforcement; I think we now need to do political enforcement
3025," As we all know, in 1995 Srebrenica experienced a genocide on a scale not seen in Europe since the second world war"
3026," Eight thousand Muslim men and boys were murdered, women were raped, children were slain in front of their parents, and bodies were pushed into mass graves with the use of bulldozers"
3027, The Srebrenica massacre of 1995 was an atrocity
3028, The genocide of thousands of Muslim men and boysthe most horrific of eventsis now being dismissed and genocidedenial sentiments are rising among Republika Srpska factions
3029," We must help them to get back to the pre1992 situation, when everyone worked together regardless of religion or ethnicity"
3030," Member for Strangford Jim Shannon mentioned, we need to reform annexe 4 of the constitution to ensure that there is democratic accountability, and to give that confidence to people in the region and area"
3031, Member for Strangford Jim Shannon that he  had changed his position during the debates on the Irish question we had here in the 1990s and into the 2000s
3032,"As I mentioned, I sat through those debates and questions in the 1990s, and I am not prepared to sit through more months and years of prevarication"
3033," But, to this day, not far away from where we stand, there are many people, and many countries backing people, who do deny what happened in 1995"
3034," More than 8,000 Muslim men and boys were massacred, women were systematically raped and the lives of more than 100,000 people were taken in a war led by greed and inhumanity"
3035," It would, in effect, enshrine the results of 1990s ethnic cleansing"
3036," In the last few years, Putin has delivered semi automatic weapons to Republika Srpska2,500 to be exact, that we know of"
3037," We know how to counter Russias disinformation and we should be doing more of it, so I urge the Minister to consider establishing a NATO counterdisinformation capability at NATO headquarters in Sarajevo"
3038," As in the 1990s, bloodshed would displace thousands of people, and we would need to respond with boots on the ground"
3039," My interest in that part of the world arises from the fact that, from 2000 to 2002, I worked with the United Nations mission in Kosovo after the NATO bombing of the former Yugoslavia"
3040," Prior to 2000, the Serbians had come into Kosovo; I saw at first hand some of the atrocities that had been carried out by the Serbian Government in Kosovo"
3041," After I came into Parliament in 2010, I got interested in Srebrenica in particular and founded the group with a Conservative Member"
3042," Many of us will remember seeing images of the war in Bosnia during the 1990s, watching the horror of the footage of Sarajevo under siege and people being held in concentration camps, and slowly learning about the reports of the atrocities committed across Bosnia that culminated in genocide"
3043, The APPG was set up in 2013 with the purpose of commemorating Srebrenica and reminding us of those horrors
3044," We cannot return to the violence and destruction of the 1990s, so it is important for the United Kingdom to start working together with our European partners and with others in the world to ensure that they do not happen again"
3045," Bosnia has seen ongoing political violence since the early 1990s, and long before the Bosnian war of 1995"
3046," First, Bosnia and Herzegovina is faced with thousands of migrants and asylum seekers wanting somewhere to live"
3047," However, in this case, in 201819 only 1,223 of the 2,865 reported cases of domestic violence resulted in a court decisionthose figures worry me, as this is less than half"
3048," Therefore, I suspectI do not have any evidential base to prove this, but I do not think I am far wrongthat many hundreds, if not thousands, more women are probably suffering at the hands of abusers but are too frightened to report it, given the ongoing human rights abuses"
3049," Although more than 8,000 people died, there are nowhere near that many graves there, because a lot of the remains have not been found"
3050," When we visit children in our own constituency, we might have helped their parents as asylum seekers and refugees in the late 1990s"
3051," In the light of the comparison that he is making, it is worth stressing that there are similarities with the Good Friday agreement, which did lock in identity back in 1998, and to some extent, has not evolved, as Dayton also has not"
3052," The Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocity Prevention Act 2018 commits the US Government to pursuing a Governmentwide strategy to identify, prevent and respond to atrocity risk"
3053, I visited in 2000 as a young undergraduate doing some charity work
3054, I am talking about the 1
3055,"8 million Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina who will surely find their way in that situation towards other parts of Europe and towards our own shores,  rather than being able to build their current and future lives in their own country"
3056," I therefore pay tribute to all those across the whole region who have done so much to maintain peace since 1995, and I defer to the position of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office"
3057," She took me to the Government headquarters, and I was making polite conversation with her"
3058, I asked her simply what the civil war in the early 1990s meant for her
3059," It was estimated that some 23,000 women, children and elderly people were put on buses and driven to Muslimcontrolled territory, while, as others have said, 8,000plus battleage men were detained and killed"
3060, We need to uphold the provisions of the Dayton peace agreement that was signed in November 1995
3061," Friend for sharing that because I remember visiting the Srebrenica memorial in 2015, and two Serbian young men driving past in their car with music blaring, throwing bottles of urine into the memorial"
3062," Does he agree that it is vital that as many Members of this House as possible visit and learn, because it is only through seeing the visceral pain that was there in 2015, and is there now, that we can truly understand how much of a tinderbox Bosnia is"
3063," It started doing so in both the 2015 and 2017 Parliaments, but the general elections cut short that work"
3064," On the substance, we are recommending the following first, an outright ban on any Member acting as a paid parliamentary adviser, consultant or strategist, which was a recommendation of the 2018 Committee on Standards in Public Life report on Members outside interests; secondly, the introduction of a new requirement that a Member must have a written contract for any outside work that makes it explicit that their duties cannot include lobbying Ministers, Members or public officials, or providing advice about how to lobby or influence Parliament, and that their employer will give them an undertaking not to ask them to do so; and thirdly, clarification of the criteria for the serious wrong exemption in the lobbying rules, to make clearer the risks of conflicts of interest and to put an end to this being used as a loophole"
3065,"On the issue of natural justice and a fair hearing, as I have said several times recently, all Members of the House, because of article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689, are treated differently from every other citizen in the country"
3066," I welcome the consultation, but in regard to paragraphs 196, 243 and 244 of the report, will the Chairman accept that there must be full and proper consultation before any judicial figure is appointed, and therefore before his or her report comes about Otherwise, we will have a prejudgment on the question of fairness, article 6 and all that goes with it and the issue of a fair trial with Members"
3067," In 95% or 98% of referrals, when the Committee makes its decision, the Member accepts it and we move forward, but on the rare occasions when the Member feels badly done by, there should be, as in other organisations, a right of appeal to a completely independent organisation"
3068," It seems illogical to me that two Members of the House, one of whom is a Minister, could be wined and dined at Wimbledon on a ticket that costs £2,500, then the Minister does not have to register that with the House and never has to register its value, even though they might be the Minister who makes decisions about tennis funding in the UK, whereas the Member who is not a Minister has to register it within 28 days"
3069,I deployed in September 1992 with 900 men and some women to save lives
3070," We managed to save quite a number of people, for example in April 1993 we led on pulling out about 2,000 people from Srebrenica three years before the disaster of July 1995, but we failed to save many others, so, in my view, it was not a success"
3071," It ground on until that awful genocide of Srebrenica in July 1995, when 8,372 men and boys were murdered by the Bosnian Serb armyby the way, the same Bosnian Serb army that might want to split away"
3072," Paddy told me a story about having dinner with Franjo Tuman, the President of Croatia, in May 1995 at the Guildhall in London"
3073," Paddy said to Tuman, How do you see the future of Bosnia in 10 years time Tuman grabbed a menu, drew a map of Bosnia and divided it in half half Serb, half Croat"
3074," Everyone is a south Slav, but by religion they are 30% Serb, 15% Croat and over 50% Bosnian Muslim1"
3075,8 million people
3076," Bosnia matters to us, because if the Croats and the Serbs divide the country in half, guess what will happen to 1"
3077, She called on allies to contribute personnel to the NATO headquarters in Sarajevo and to support work to counter disinformation and strengthen defence reform
3078," I met the Elnos Group and its UK partner Emico, which recently won a contract to deliver 13 prefabricated substations for HS2 and is planning to bid for more"
3079," In the four quarters to the end of the first quarter of 2021, total trade in goods and services was worth £117 millionan increase of 77% or £51 million on the previous year"
3080," In a nutshell, although in courts, tribunals or professional disciplinary arrangements, any person in the land could  apply for judicial review where there had been a failure to comply with such procedures, that does not apply because of parliamentary privilege and article 9 of the Bill of Rights"
3081," By the final meeting, only 50% of the membership had attended all three meetings, and four of the 11 members who attended that meeting had not attended the meeting in which the evidence of my right hon"
3082, Gentleman agree that under the rules paid advocacy has been banned from this House since 1695 Why do this Government appear to be bending the rules when it suits them
3083," In 2012, the House recognised the need for a whistleblowing provision to make it clear that in exceptional cases, if there were some serious wrong, a Member could approach the responsible Minister or public official, even if to do so might incidentally benefit a paying client"
3084,"If any Member, regardless of their political affiliation, is involved in paid advocacy to the tune of £100,000 per year, I would expect the House and the Committee to come to the same conclusionfor a Member from any political party and of any affiliation"
3085, We only have an hour and a half to discuss this
3086, It turns the clock back to before 1695
3087," The Member repeatedly, over a sustained period, lobbied officials and Ministers on behalf of his paying clients, Randox and Lynns Country Foods, from whom he was receiving more than £9,000 a month, as he still is"
3088," In some shape or form, it has been banned since 1695 and expressly so since  cash for questions, which brought this House into terrible disrepute in the 1990s"
3089," We would be dismantling the rule on paid advocacy, which has been around in some shape or form since 1695"
3090, It estimates that we will  need 10 GW of nuclear power by 2035
3091," It is not in dispute that the proposed model will lower the cost of capital on nuclear projectsI fully accept thatand it is also not in dispute that it would lower overall costs, although Conservative Members take issue with the frankly heroic assumptions that underpin the claimed £30 billion to £80 billion in longterm savings visvis coalfired financed projects"
3092," The 2015 Committee on Standards report on The Standards System in the House of Commons noted that the provisions relating to the panel had never been invoked, questioned why the investigatory panel was necessary and recommended that the provisions be reviewed"
3093,"The Leader of the House is utterly detached from the reality of most working MPs in the House, so let me inform him that most of us do not need to get paid £100,000 to do the job we are already paid for"
3094, The introduction of a House of Commons Standards Commissioner in 1995 and the Standards Committee in 2013 were key features of strengthening the system
3095, Members and the public will remember cash for questions and those Tory scandals of the 1990s
3096," Friend the Member for Harwich and North Essex Sir Bernard Jenkin said, the 2003 recommendation of the Committee on Standards in Public Life is worth looking at"
3097, I expected maybe to come to a debate that would be the usual suspects speaking on behalf of one of their palsbut not today
3098," Why do we not get the executive committee of the 1922 Committee to replace the whole of the judicial system across the UK If a Conservative supporter is found guilty of any offence, why do we not get a committee set up to reconsider that verdict and have a look at it once again That is the type of realm of possibility we are getting into with this"
3099, Member for North Shropshire Mr Paterson broke multiple rules when he lobbied the Government on behalf of Randox and Lynns Country Foods
3100," If the Leader of the House wants us to look at how we approach these things in future, he should bring forward a debate, not just 90 minutes where he took up half the time, because nobody has an opportunity to get in and say anything"
3101,1212 for the purposes of Standing Order No
3102," Does he recognise that someone who sold 1 million copies of a single in the 1990s typically saw their single reach the top 25 singles of the year, whereas about 1,700 different artists had more than 1 million streams last year He is right that there is a lot of streaming, but it is being shared so much more widely, so is it not inevitable that many people will receive less"
3103," Some eight out of 10 artists earn less than £200 year from streaming, which is not acceptable"
3104," One million streams sounds like an awful lot, but, in comparison to CD sales, it is not very much in terms of revenue generated for rights holders from digital service providers"
3105, The fact that the Government were able to find £2 billion for the  cultural recovery fund and bring in schemes such as the live events reinsurance scheme has kept the industry going
3106," Streaming has increased steadily, but between 2016 and 2019figures that come from the International Property Offices survey of creative industries earningsartists remuneration has gone up by 46%, whereas revenue to the labels has only gone up by 31%"
3107," However, in the Spanish system, about 23% of the revenue goes on administrative costs"
3108," The Committee pointed out that CDs cost tuppencehapenny to produce, and therefore it cost virtually nothing to make millions of them, and yet they were sold for a vast amount£10 or more"
3109," About 40% of that revenue goes into marketing and AR, which identifies artists and finds them"
3110," However, 26% of the market for releases is now held by the small independent sector"
3111," If a label that is signing an artist and making an initial investment of tens of millions of pounds has the knowledge that they and the artist have reached a contractual agreement that will extend and that will allow that money to be recouped over a lengthy period, that does give certainty"
3112," For example, the NHS has given ambulance trusts an extra £55 million to boost staff numbers this winter; there is nearly half a billion to fund an enhanced discharge programme; and we have measures to reduce pressure on accident and emergency departments, reduce waiting times and improve patient flow"
3113," One of our main defences is, of course, our vaccination programmes, and we are expanding our booster programme, which hit the milestone of 19 million doses yesterday, along with delivering the largest flu vaccination programme in UK history"
3114," Yesterday, we announced how we will be buying a total of 114 million additional Pfizer and Moderna doses for 2022 and 2023, which will futureproof our Great British vaccination effort and make sure we can protect even more people in the years ahead"
3115," Today, I am pleased to update the House on the £700 million fund that we announced in September for elective recovery"
3116," This includes £112 million for the northeast and Yorkshire, £131 million for the midlands and  £97 million for the northwest"
3117, At least £330 million will be invested in the NHS estate and a further £250 million will be spent on digital initiatives that aid elective recovery
3118," Over £600 million from this fund has already been committed to approved bids, such as for new wards at University Hospitals Birmingham, a new South Mersey elective hub and a new, modular unit in Castle Hill Hospital in Hull"
3119, It is part of £5
3120,"4 billion that we have announced to support the NHS response to the pandemic in the second half of the year and it builds on the work done ahead of last winter, where we invested £450 million to upgrade AE facilities in over 120 separate trusts, to boost capacity"
3121," It was volume 2 of their famous vinyl album, if I recall correctly"
3122," Friend the Member for East Yorkshire supported in the mid2000s, and that is why it is 70 years rather than 50 years"
3123," On iTunes, it is 0"
3124," Apple Music is a little more generous, with 0"
3125, They have said that 82% of professional musicians have made £200 per year less from streaming
3126," This is totally different from the 1990s, when someone who did sell massive amounts of singles got real rewards"
3127," We are coming into the Christmas season, and someone who is lucky enough to have had a Christmas hit in the 1970s or 1980sthere have not been so many recentlywill hit the jackpot, because their song will get played again and again and go right to the top of the steaming charts"
3128,"I was waiting patiently for my colleague, the third member of MP4, to get to his feet today"
3129, Gentleman that he is the best drummer in MP4
3130," It is important that we pay tribute to his talent, as seen in his solo work and in MP4, of which there are several members here today and which has brought much entertainment both inside and outside the House"
3131," The 1960s gave us some of the greatest bands, but they also gave us the sharp managers who invented new ways to rip off talented and often workingclass youngsters"
3132," It is the Houses duty to modernise the law to reflect the reality of the music industry and challenge the status quo whereby most streaming incomean estimated 55% of itends up in the pockets of record labels, streaming platforms and digital giants while 15% goes to artists and publishers"
3133," When an original music workor lyrics accompanying musicis  created, the composer or composers of that work have rights under the 1988 Act to control exploitation of that work"
3134," However, it is suggested that about eight out of 10 performers earn less than £200 a year from music streaming"
3135," However, while performers are entitled to equitable remuneration for performances for radio, television and other channels, they are not in respect of music streaming due to the exceptions set out in the 1988 Act"
3136, The UK music industry contributed £5
3137,"8 billion to the UK economy in 2019, which was an 11% increase on the prior year"
3138," Employment in the industry hit an alltime high in 2019, at 197,000 people, which was an increase of 3% on the prior year"
3139, The total export revenue of the music industry was £2
3140,"9 billion in 2019, which was an increase of about 9% on the prior year"
3141," Gentleman will have read the IPOs report, so he will have seen the chart showing that at the end of 2015, about 16,000 artists made up 90% of Spotifys streams"
3142," By the second quarter of last year, that number had gone up to 43,000, so the market is much more fragmented"
3143," Gentleman makes a great deal of how little an artist receives for 1 million streams, but in fact, 1 billion streams is not that much"
3145," The income from 1 million streams is equivalent to the income from 1,000 CD sales"
3146," When I asked, Could you fill a venue here in London he said, I could halffill one in London, but I could fill 10 venues in Los Angeles"
3147," If we look at the data, we see that, at 31%, live performance is the main revenue stream"
3148," Then there is teaching of music at 9%, audio streaming royalties at 6%, physical sales at 5%, digital sales at 5%, sessional orchestral work at 5%, broadcasts at 5%, public performances at 4%, commissions for stage at 3%, merchandise at 3%, video streaming royalties at 3%, and a whole raft of others"
3149," At the start, the streaming service takes its cut, which is typically around 30%, although there is no industry standard, and the rest is split among all the other parties back down the supply chain"
3150, Today is also the anniversary of the release in 1984 of Band Aids Do they know its Christmas
3151," I am old enough to recall Tim, now Lord, ClementJoness Live Music Bill in another place, testing parliamentary support on more than one occasion before the then Government were evidentially satisfied that they could support a version of the Bill becoming the landmark Live Music Act 2012"
3152, In 201819precovidthe UK music industry contributed £5
3153,"8 billion to the UK economy, up 11% from 2018"
3154," In 2019, prepandemic this is quite interestingthe median reported income for musicians currently signed to major record companies was £51,000, for musicians signed to independent record labels it was £20,000, and for selfreleasing artists it was £13,000"
3155," Sadly, the Music creators earnings in the digital era report found no evidence that there was ever a time when recorded music was the basis of substantial income for most musicians, even in the 1990s when revenues in the music industry were higher"
3156," On behalf of the campaigners and the many other voices across the country, and given the support for the Bill on both sides of the House, I ask the Government to allow it to be considered in more detail at a future date"
3157," My parents and grandparents were lucky enough to witness the British invasion when, in the mid1960s, rock and pop acts of the United Kingdom penetrated the shores of the United States and flooded the music industry"
3158," Screened on Disney Plus, the eighthour documentary covers the making of the Beatles 1970 album Let It Be"
3159," It is unbelievable that sitting alone in a studio, playing a great selection of songssometimes, depending how they were scheduledand broadcasting to thousands, or hundreds, depending on the size of the radio station, is a job people get paid for"
3160," I love their workPhil Collins is a genius, from his work with Genesis to his great solo albums of the 1980s and 1990s"
3161, The days of hopping on the bus into town to spend our pocket money on the latest 7inch single are long gone
3162," There is a temptation to think that every music label is some big corporate beast with millions of pounds sloshing around, but that is simply not the case"
3163," Well, that came all the way to New Zealand, and it was great to be able to sing the likes of U2 as a 15yearold"
3164," I think Members across the House will be staggered to know that the chairman and chief executive officer of one of the three major corporations that dominate the market of recorded music is set to receive more income this year£153 million, according to industry press reportsthan every songwriter and composer in the UK combined, including the rich ones, will receive from the streaming of their music in this country"
3165," The report, titled Economics of music streaming, was unanimously agreed, crossparty, after many months of hearings with witnesses from all parts of the music industry and after hundreds of written submissions on the subject were received"
3166," Sadly, the other big two, Warner and Universal, have not followed suit, and in the latter case, a public share offering has been issued that will result in the extraordinary £153 million payout to the companys boss, at a time when many artists have been struggling to pay their rent, as we heard in evidence"
3167," It extends the existing Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 to modernise the law for the new world of music streaming"
3168," The Committee concluded that the fix that I am proposing today was the best way to build on existing UK law to rectify the matter, but there is an issue with how much streaming services pay and with how much they are paid by record companies about 30%, after the Chancellor has his bit, of the cut from the subscription we pay and the ad revenues"
3169," The point is that labels no longer have to manufacture or distribute records, there is no longer a percentage getting broken on the way to the record shopall those costs are gone"
3170, Streaming revenue actually grew by 20% in 2020
3171," In fact, fully independent music accounts  for a very small proportion, probably 6%, of the total market, and fully independent artists who experience success are the ones making the most from streaming"
3172," As for companies, which are sometimes making 20% profit margins in the streaming era, with none of the costs associated with distribution or manufacturing, saying that they will pass any cut to that margin on to their own artists, that is surely the strongest possible argument that there is something very wrong with competition in this market"
3173, One company may control as much as 40% of the market
3174," When changes were made in 2003 to copyright in relation to film, similar points were made, but we have seen the burgeoning expansion of the British film industry since that point, and I want the same for music"
3175," Gentleman mentions Lucian Grainge; he may be aware that were an artist in Britain to produce a song and get 1 million streams, they would receive around £100, so to receive the £153 million that Lucian Grainge gets, that artist would need 1"
3176,5 million million streams
3177," While Lucian Grainge may be a great corporate man, making £3 million a week, he has never produced any music that we would ever want to listen to"
3178, It has brought in a programme called Artists Forward in which it has essentially written off unrecouped balances for artists signed before the year 2000
3179," Will he acknowledge that it is also a vital part of our tourism attraction, bringing in about £4"
3180,7 billion in tourism revenue for this country every year
3181, We are talking about £4
3182,"7 billion of spending in the UK economy, which was an increase of 6% of the prior year"
3183," I recall that in the early 2000s there were sites such as Napster, which in their very early  stages shared content that I am sure the artist did not even know was being shared"
3184," We have to get the right balance between protecting artists 100%, ensuring innovation with regard to platforms and new forms of engaging with media and music, and making sure that we remain competitive in the UK"
3185," Watford has the Colosseum, which has done recordings for films such as The Lord of the Ringsreally incredible pieces that have been heard around the world by millions, if not billions, of people"
3186, Does he agree that it is a scandal that artists are getting perhaps a quarter of what the big record labels are getting from streaming services As my hon
3187," I very much hope I will receive an invitation to hear his crossparty band, MP4"
3188, Global revenues hit £16
3189,2 billion last yearthe highest since 2002
3190," Between 2015 and 2019, revenues enjoyed by labels have grown by more than £200 million"
3191," 1 pop stars on Radio 1 or at the forefront of everyones mind when we think about rock and roll or music streaming, but there is a huge weight of people who are fansindividuals or groups who are more at the edges"
3192," It is now commonplace, but it was a brave and innovative vision and move from Daniel Ek, Spotifys founder, back in 2006"
3193," There were 100 million new music subscribers in 2020, taking the total to 467 million, whereas back in 2015 it stood at 76"
3194,8 million
3195," Each one of those subscribers is paying on average £120 a year, so we can see the growth and the enormity of streaming"
3196," A licence gives the artist 50% of the royalties for a song, whereas a sale gives them between 18% and 30%"
3197," We might have needed to provide some extra money through universal credit, and that would be right, but these  international companies should have paid their way and not asked the British taxpayer to pay those wages on their behalf"
3198, I note that in 2017 the figure was 31
3199,"92%, and I am sure my hon"
3200," Friend will be surprised to learn that it went down in 2018, 2019 and 2020, to 30"
3201,13%
3202, to 100% of the money they generate
3203," Artist remuneration has risen to 46% of overall revenue, compared with an increase in label revenues of 31%, meaning that artists are claiming a larger share of streaming revenue than they have done traditionally"
3204," Successful artists from the 1980s funded investment into new artists in the 1990s, which in turn funded investment into the young artists of the 2000s"
3205," I suggest to her that if we look at the music business around the world, 30% RD is what is happening in all markets"
3206," YouTube accounted for more than 20% of streaming consumption in the UK last year, but generated only £35 million in royalties, £20 million less than artists and labels earned from good oldfashioned vinyl records"
3207," In fact, the top 1% will get richer at everybody elses expense"
3208," Gentleman in a moment, because no doubt he will want to remind us how reasonable it is that the CEO of Universal gets £153 million a year, which is more than the entirety of sales and of streaming for all UK artists and songwriters, including people such as Ed Sheeran"
3209," To get that from streaming, as I mentioned, he would have to have 1"
3210," Gentleman may claim that 1 million streams is not very much, but I would very much enjoy a small fraction of that for this speech anywhere it was shown"
3211, It is a lot for a musician to break through that million mark
3212," I appreciate that, in the global marketplace, there are stars who break through into the billions, but that is not the point"
3213, The point has been made already about the hundreds of thousands of people in the industry and its importance for the export and tourism markets
3214, 1 in the charts
3215," We have set out the creative industries sector deal, the creative sector tax reliefs, the film and television production restart scheme and the culture recovery fund, and the Chancellors plan for growth sets out a major longterm commitment to the sector, which we calculate contributes approximately £116 billion to the UK economy"
3216," At the recent Budget the Government announced £42 million to support our creative industries, and we include in that the small and mediumsized enterprises at the heart of film, music and video gamesthat broader nexus of digital entrepreneurship"
3217," The BPI reported revenues from streaming growing to almost £737 million in 2020, which is a 15% increase during the pandemic, with smartphones, smart speakers and music streaming services providing unprecedented choice for consumers"
3218," That was the biggest arts funding package in our history, and the Chancellor made available £2 billion at speed, with awards to more than 800 musicbased organisations"
3219," We also put in place the £800 million reinsurance scheme and I am delighted, as I am sure all Members are, that we can get back to live music venues, and indeed to live theatre and pub theatre"
3220," Our 1709 Statute of Anne was the first copyright Act in the world, and today the UK is a world leader in copyright law and intellectual property enforcement"
3221," We are determined to tackle the problem of piracy, and not just those of us  who remember recording Top of the Pops on a cassette in the 1970s, which is a low form of thatI would not say it is harmless, but as the former Chair of the Select Committee made clear, probably all of us old enough to do so did it, and it was wrong"
3222," From the early 2000s, record companies saw a 15year period of global revenue decline"
3223," Recorded music revenues were decimated due to digital piracy, and subscription streaming services such as Spotifyothers are availableentered the market in 2008"
3224," By 2015, they had played a major part in halting that decline, as consumers began to adopt subscription services and paying for the right to listen to music"
3225," In 2015, there were on average 2"
3226,1 billion streams a month
3227," By 2020, that figure had grown to 10 billion"
3228," I am pleased that a number of singersongwriters, composers and musicians in my area have benefited from that, including MaryAnne Hatton, Oliver Seager and Jack PerryCockings, who have all received support of up to £10,000 from the fund"
3229," Decca Records contributed £10,000 to kickstart our Dame Vera Lynn memorial project and the statue dedicated to her, but it must not be the case that the record companies and those advocating a voluntary approach can just do or give what they want"
3230," Friend the Member for Watford Dean Russell regaled us with earlier, I may even have auditioned for the New Zealand version of the Spice Girls in 1998, and I was also in a queue at 3 am, in the ExCeL centre in London, to audition for The X Factor in 2010"
3231," If we need a new generation of MP4, many of us would quite like to step forward and do that"
3232, 11 2
3233, Friend the Member for Perth and North Perthshire Pete Wishart and I are occasionally together in a musical enterprise called MP4
3234," It makes up more than 70% of UK recorded music revenues, generating hundreds of millions of pounds of new revenue for the UK music industry"
3235," The music industrys importance to the UK economy is frequently citedas the Select Committee points out, it contributes more than £5 billion in gross value addedand we are the second biggest exporter of music in the world, which does an enormous amount in terms of global Britain and the projection of our soft power"
3236, Lucian Grainge is the chief executive of Universal Music and is going to bank a huge amount of money this year because Universal Music has just conducted a very successful initial public offering and sold a 10% share
3237," Beginning in the early 2000s, there was a 15year decline in music industry revenue that was directly attributable to piracy"
3238," We have been together in so many of the various torturous debates about copyright reform, and I think we all still bear the scars of the Digital Economy Act 2017"
3239, I just hope that the record labels that have written to us so assiduously in the past few weeks sometimes remember what we did for them when the dark times started to descend on the sector and the industry in the early 2000s
3240," Gentlemans for about  20 years in MP4, the worlds only parliamentary rock band"
3241," Lots of people ask, What does this musical moonlighting mean for the future of MP4 Well, we are the only rock band in the world that can sustain political differences as well as musical differences, so I think we can maybe just put up with a bit of musical moonlighting"
3242," I was signed to two major record companies I signed to Chrysalis Records in 1987, and it was taken over by EMI in the early 1990s"
3243, We did quite well during that period we sold 1
3244,"5 million records, we had modest success in the UK with two topfive albums, and we had a couple of topfive albums in Scandinavia and Germany"
3245, We sold 1
3246," Thousands did return, but with lifechanging injuries, and over 3,500 personnel from other NATO forces were also killed"
3247," Since Ahmad Shah Durrani founded modernday Afghanistan in the 1700s, it has not been run from the centre"
3248," The objective of hunting down and destroying alQaeda after 911 was widely supported, and it triggered NATOs article 5 for the first time"
3249," The last king, Zahir, was overthrown in 1973, and that triggered a power struggle between two diametrically opposed movements the Communist party and the Islamist movementthe mujaheddin"
3250, It mobilised tens of thousands of holy warriors who were willing to die for their cause
3251," However, there was the colossal blanket of NATO security, and a huge development budget often described as an international aid juggernaut; US spending alone peaked in one year at $110 billion"
3252," Secondly, we denied the Taliban a seat at the table in December  2001 at the Bonn talks"
3253," Thirdly, we made no real effort to start training an Afghan indigenous security force until 2006"
3254," Negotiations began in earnest in 2018, but when a deal was finally signed in February 2020, the agreement was between the United States and the Taliban; this time, the Afghan Government were not at the table"
3255,4% cut in defence spending over the next four years is deeply worrying
3256," One thing I would like to see from the inquiry is an investigation into what assessment, prior or immediately prior to the intervention in 2001, was made of the militarys capability to intervene and maintain our defences at the level required"
3257," In 2009, the NATO conference took place in Edinburgh"
3258," What I will never forget is that while they were enjoying a drop of Scotlands finest, they suddenly said to me, What on earth are you doing in Afghanistan This was in 2009, eight years after we went in"
3259," Those attacks killed 2,977 innocent civilians, including 67 British citizens, and we were right to defend our national security"
3260," We know that the Taliban are the root cause of the death and destruction that, unfortunately, has come to define Afghanistan since the 1990s, but we need to understand why they were able to defeat the Afghan army at such a shattering scale and pace"
3262," Why have so many colleagues failed to get adequate responses from the Foreign Office and Home Office helplines on behalf of their constituents How many more vulnerable Afghans do the Government have on their list of people who need to be supported to leave the country Why is the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme still not open for applications Is it because the Government actually have no intention of ever opening it for applications Are they in effect pursuing an operation of tapping on the shoulder, rather than opening the scheme up for applications, because the response would be so overwhelming If so, the Minister should inform the House"
3263," Just to be clear, what I said in my remarks was that there had already been multiple inquiries into the Afghan intervention preceding 2010some by the Defence Committee"
3264," It has been handed over to the Taliban, but the spirit of what is now there in Afghanistan will be bigger than anything the Taliban can do to undo it and turn it back to what we saw in the 1990s"
3265, It is my pleasure to respond on behalf of the Government
3266," As a result of our efforts and those of our allies, secondary school enrolment rose from 13% of children to almost 60%"
3267," Over 8 million more children, including 3"
3268,"6 million girls, were attending school than in 2001"
3269,"  Basic health services reached 85% of the population, and the proportion of people with access to clean water and sanitation doubled"
3270," The 11 September attacks were the only occasion in NATOs history on which it has invoked article 5, its collective selfdefence clause"
3271," They are, first, to preserve the counterterrorism gains that we have achieved, and ensure that Afghanistan does not again become a source of threats to the region or beyond, including here in the UK; secondly, to provide humanitarian support for the Afghan people, who are facing extreme hardship42% of the population, more than 18 million people, are suffering crisis or emergency levels of severe acute malnutrition; thirdly, to press for inclusive politics and respect for human rights, especially the full and equal rights of girls to go to school and women to go to work; and finally, to ensure that the events in Afghanistan do not destabilise the region, for example, through uncontrolled outflows of refugees or the export of narcotics"
3272," The Prime Minister has said that we will double humanitarian and development assistance for Afghanistan this year, to £286 million"
3273," On 31 October, he announced the allocation of £50 million of that to fund emergency humanitarian support"
3274, The money will help to provide 2

3283," Potholes drive us potty in the Potteries, so with the announcement in the Budget of £2"
3284,"7 billion to fix them, does he agree that StokeonTrent should get a big slice, particularly when taking into account the condition and use of our roads, and that congestion delays drivers by an average of more than a minute for every mile travelled"
3285, One and a half million tests a daywe spent £37 billion on Test and Trace
3286," We have increased deliveries by 100% from 120 million to 300 million in the month of December, and that is more than any other country in the world"
3287," We have tripled the supply for January and February from 100 million to 300 million a month, so the UKs testing programme is the biggest in Europe, with over 400 million tests carried out to datetwice the number in France and more than four times the number in Germany"
3288, They identified 73 contracts worth more than £3
3289,"7 billion, equivalent to 20% of covid19 contracts, between February and November 2020 that raised concerns about possible corruption"

3291," In late 2020, Moonshot was subsumed into another costly fiascoNHS Test and Trace, which was set up in May 2020 with an opening budget of £22 billion, with a further £15 billion, totalling £37 billion, over two years"
3292," On 15 March 2021, in a now infamous tweet to UK firms Omega Diagnostics and Mologic, Lord Bethell, then Innovation Minister in the Department for Health and Social Care, publicly promised diagnostics contracts, with the hundreds of jobs necessary to fulfil them"
3293," What is going on To add insult to injury, the Department is now pursuing  Omega for £2"
3294,5 million because of its own failure to progress the contract
3295," According to Omega, it would have had to capacity to deliver 1 million to 2 million tests per week had the contract gone ahead, and Mologic could potentially produce even more"
3296," The contract was pulled just before the phase 3 trial results were published, causing the share price to halve, but the results showed the vaccine to be highly effective and safe"
3297," Inactivated vaccines are a well established, tried and tested technology that has been used over the last hundred years to vaccinate billions of people, including for seasonal flu, hepatitis A, polio and rabies"
3298," The European Commission, the Government of Bahrain and, more recently, Scottish Enterprise are in advanced discussions with the company to provide a grant of £20 million"
3299,"5 billion items of PPE, the majority of which have either been delivered or are on their way and enable us to meet the future needs of health and social care workers"
3300," Since 9 April 2020, more than 5"
3301,4 billion items of PPE have been ordered through the eportal
3302, We have been building UK manufacturing capacity and we have been doing so by signing contracts with more than 30 Britishbased companies for the provision of 3
3304," Does the Minister not share my concern that there have been significant markups on a range of products, from PPE to lateral flow devices, so that companies that prior to the pandemic were in deficit now enjoy enormous profitsin the multimillions of poundsfor doing little more than purchasing and passing on products to the UK Government and trousering significant profits Does that not disturb him"
3305, Does he have any indication of what percentage of the test devices that he has touted as the greatest number in the world were manufactured here in the UK by domestic diagnostic companies
3306," That is the most important thing, and we are working to procure hundreds of millions more"
3307, The Government have provided £400 billion of direct support for the economy during the pandemic to date
3308," We are issuing millions of rapid tests per day via home delivery, with record numbers distributed in recent days"
3309,"As far as I can see, President Putin reanimated a sense of hostilitypeople can call it a cold war, or whatever they likein his Munich conference speech in 2007"
3310," Since then, what has been so blindingly depressing about western Governments, and specifically the UK Government, is that we desperately tried, really until 2014, to pretend that that had not  happened"
3311, Gentleman is a strong proponent of the European Union and campaigned for our membership of it; how does he react to Germany and France bypassing sanctions on Russia and supporting things such as the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that clearly undermine our NATO partners in central and eastern Europe
3312,The windups will begin prompt at 4
3313,"This is just a quick point the 1994 Budapest accord referred not just to Ukraine but to Kazakhstan, and today Russians have gone into Kazakhstan"
3314, The windups will start at 4
3315,To resume his seat no later than 4
3316,"Some of us are sadly old enough to be able to remember Hungary in 1953, the subsequent removal of Alexander Dubek in Czechoslovakia, more recently the annexation of parts of Georgia, and then the invasion and annexation of Crimea"
3317," We keep saying that Russias aggression must not be rewarded, but the past decade and a half has seen Russias aggression effectively rewarded and go unpunished again and again"
3318," To that extent, how can she ensure that the meetings taking place on 9 and 10 January in Geneva will actually mark a significant departure in past practice from the west so that from now on we will act much more decisively and be completely united We cannot succumb to the divisive way in which Russia is attempting to separate the United States from its NATO allies"
3319,I welcomed the Baltic states to the UK last autumn and I was very clear about the UKs complete support for them and our complete commitment to our article 5 obligations
3320," Indeed, recently declassified documents from the United States make it clear that in February 1990, Secretary of State James Baker gave President Gorbachev a categoric assurance that NATO would not, and had no plans to, move east"
3321," The UK remains supportive of Ukraines NATO membership aspirations, in line with the 2008 Bucharest summit declaration"
3322," Will she confirm that she has had a direct conversation with the new German Government about Nord Stream 2 and that she will ask them to halt its operationalisation, given that that is the single most important bargaining chip in the hands of Europe and NATO today"
3323," I did meet my German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock, on the margins of G7, and both the Prime Minister and I have made it very clear that we do not believe that Nord Stream 2 should go ahead"
3324," She mentioned the 1994 Budapest memorandum, to which we were also a signatory"
3325," It was signed away by the pen of Khrushchev, without the Crimean people being consulted at all, in the 1950s"
3326," In early 2017, there was another chemical weapon attack in Syria and, within a short space of time, the American Administration under President Trump launched 26 Tomahawk missiles on strategic targets in Syria"
3327," Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham Daniel Kawczynski often talks about Nord Stream 2, and he is right to do so"
3328," In the cold war, we spent 5% of GDP on defence"
3329," Just before the 2017 general election I was on the Treasury Committee, and I lobbied the then Chairman for an inquiry into exactly this subject"
3330," New figures suggest that the reason is, in large part at least, the slashing of more than 6,000 civil service jobs in the last decade while the proportion of civil servants in the highest grades has nearly doubled"
3331," As most Members probably know, we set up a crossGovernment Russia unit in 2017, bringing together the UKs diplomatic, intelligence and military capabilities to try to achieve the maximum effect, and we are working closely with our partners to address the threats from Russia and hold it to account"
3332," Following the appalling attack in Salisbury in 2018, we expelled 23 Russian intelligence officers, and the international community joined us in solidarity"
3333, This includes increasing the amount of support available through UK Export Finance for projects in Ukraine to £3
3334," These announcements complement our existing security, economic and political support to Ukraine, which includes defensive military training for 20,000 members of Ukraines armed forces through Operation Orbital; a package of £1"
3335,7 billion to enhance Ukrainian naval capabilities; and vital support in fighting corruption and strengthening the judiciary
3336,"I am absolutely grateful to her for giving me the opportunity to explain my answer about Channel 4, which was misrepresented on social media"
3337," Channel 4 does take its public borrowings from the Government and the taxpayer, and that is what I was referring to"
3338," Channel 4 borrowings do not come from investment;  they come from the Government, and that is what I was talking about in my answer to the Select Committee"
3339," The ultimatum is premised on a fundamental lie, which Putin has promulgated since he attended the  Bucharest NATO summit in 2008 as an invited guest"
3340," Nevertheless, we should not dismiss what Russia has done since 2008 and what Russia is capable of doing with its vast arsenal of new weaponry, and nor should we take a complacent view of Russias future intentions"
3341," After all, just months after the Bucharest summit in 2008, where he was welcomed as a guest, Putin seized Georgian sovereign territory in Abkhazia and South Ossetia"
3342, In 2014 he illegally annexed the Crimea
3343, They have claimed sovereignty over 1
3344,"2 million square miles of Arctic seabed, including the north pole, which together contain huge oil and gas and mineral reserves"
3345," Let us remind ourselves that Russias war against Ukraine in 2014 was provoked not by Ukraine attempting to join NATO, but by its proposed association agreement with the EU"
3346," The Wagner Group is a socalled private sector operation, but it is licensed by, closely related to and deeply embedded in the Kremlin, and operates on its behalf and at its behest"
3347," We open up our highend housing market to Russian billionaires even though we know that the best way to squirrel away a dirty fortune or, indeed, to launder £20 million is to buy a property that is worth £10 million for £20 million"
3348," Yes, £10 million is lost, but we have managed to clean up £10 million"
3349," I believe every single word of it to be true and I wholeheartedly support her campaign, which, in the end, is a campaign on behalf of the Russian people to ensure that Russias wealth is for the Russian people, not a few kleptocrats"
3350," I would argue   that that change is happening 10 times faster than in the industrial revolution of the late 18th and 19th centuries, at 100 times the scale and with 1,000 times the impact"
3352," After the annexation of Crimea by the Russians in 2014, a referendum was held  withthey claiman 83% turnout, in which, apparently, 97% of voters supported the regions being integrated back into Russia"
3353, Ukraine is not a part of NATOwe have established thatalthough it has been a member of the Partnership for Peace since 1994
3354," Indeed, I remember in that year, when I had the grand title of chief of policy at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europedoesnt that sound greathaving dealings, for the first time, with its armed forces"
3355," There is no article 5 commitment to defend the territorial integrity of the country, but, as we have all discussed this afternoon, what happens there really matters to the rest of us in Europe"
3356," Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham Daniel Kawczynski keeps jumping up to mention, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline really puts such countries as Poland and Ukraine in a Catch22 situation"
3357," I was very pleased when, earlier today, the Foreign Secretary announced that we categorically do not support Nord Stream 2, but what does that mean The answer is not very much, because it looks as if it will go ahead anyway"
3358," Moreover, Germany continues selfishly to pursue a beggar thy neighbour energy policy sympathetic to Nord Stream 2, making it potentially even easier for Russia to deploy the gas weapon"
3359," The outcome of that election is highly uncertain, but some of the candidates, such as ric Zemmour, who in 2013 declared Vladimir Putin as his own man of the year, worry me"
3360," Moreover, weighed down with covidrelated debt and with international gas spot prices now at near record levels, and despite frequent entreaties from the United States as the leader of the alliance, the majority of NATO members still do not meet even the basic target of spending at least 2% of GDP on defence, with Germany at only around 1"
3361,"7% this year, and Spain barely at even 1%"
3362," Accompanied by the overt pressure on Ukraine, which does not possess an article 5 guarantee, were that treaty to succeed, the next step will probably be to exert pressure on countries, some of which contain significant ethnic Russian minority populations which do possess such a guarantee, and that probably means the Baltic states, with the obvious aim of dividing and ultimately breaking NATO in the process"
3363," I still hope and believe that President Biden, who as a young senator actively supported Britain during the 1982 Falklands war, can recover his leadership role and, with support from European NATO allies, face down any potential Russian incursion into the heart of Ukraine and, indeed, any further adventurism elsewhere"
3364," Friend of what happened with the invasion of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in 2008 President Bush moved the sixth fleet into the Black sea, ready to confront Russian aggression, and the invasion stopped"
3365," Since 1989, a new Europe has emerged from behind the iron curtain, with a reunited Germany at its heart and a swathe of newly free countries in central and eastern Europe"
3366," We have unique responsibilities, both as a member of the UN P5 and as the guarantor to agreements from the Budapest memorandum to the Dayton accords"
3367," Instead, we have seen a decade of decline for Britains defence, with billions of pounds of waste and mismanagement, the number of tanks cut by a third and the Army cut to its smallest size in 300 years"
3368," We must and should work to build a more consistent approach to Russia across Europe and reduce dependence on Russian gas, and that, of course, includes cancelling Nord Stream 2"
3369," Given the challenges and threats to our national and international security, does he agree it is now time to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP"
3370," I have been humbled by the quality of the contributions and struck by the 100% unanimity of the condemnation of President Putin, at least, even though there are other disagreements"
3371," Moscow has long run a campaign to subvert freedom and democracy in Ukraine, from the invasion of 2014 to cyberattacks, disinformation and the weaponisation of energy supplies"
3372," That means the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, in which Russia signed up to dispute resolution by dialogue rather than force"
3373," It means the 1994 Budapest memorandum on security assurances, in which Russia agreed to uphold Ukraines territorial integrity"
3374," And it means the 2014 Minsk protocol, in which all parties agreed to a ceasefire in the Donbass region"
3375, We are ramping up support for trade in priority areas such as technology and clean energy to £3
3376, This includes £1
3377," Britain remains opposed to Nord Stream 2, and I am working with allies and partners to highlight the strategic risks of this project"
3378," In the 1994 Budapest agreement, in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons, it was agreed that Russia  would stand behind Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity"
3379, The analysis is that it needs 250 million people to work as a viable internal trading bloc that could then challenge other areas
3380," To achieve that, the union needs the 43 million Ukrainians and their powerful agricultural output to succeed"
3381," The events of 2014 and the tragic effects of the war still being fought in the east of the country today should leave us in little doubt that Russia is prepared to violate sovereign territory to further its own aims, as the brief fiveday war of 2008 in Georgia had earlier indicated"
3382," When cyberwar is discussed, it usually seems to include everything from a Russiaattributed attack on Estonias Government and financial institutions in 2007 to the NotPetya ransomware attacks against Ukraine in 2017 and even the SolarWinds espionage of 2020, in which UK Government computers were among the millions across the world on to which Russian agents quietly sneaked, remaining to listen and gather intelligence"
3383," Despite effectively cutting off Estonia from the rest of the world and cutting off its citizens from their Government and financial institutions for some three weeks, it was not deemed an attack under article 5"
3384," Russia launched similar denialofservice attacks against the Georgian Government in 2008 as part of the fiveday war, although  this time they were aimed solely at Government and military sites"
3385," In 2017, Russia launched the ransomware NotPetya against Ukrainian banks, energy companies and infrastructure"
3386," While it is clear that Russia sees cyberespionage as part of reasonable statecraft in the present day, as the 2020 SolarWinds hack indicates, and while it is clear that Russia was perfectly happy to conduct clear cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008, the international jury is still out on what is acceptable in cyberspace"
3387," Most importantly, let us lead the international community in clearly laying down rules and norms to which Russia will feel an international obligation, so that no school or hospital ever need fear an indiscriminate cyberweapon wreaking havoc, as happened to much of the NHS at the sloppy hands of North Korea in 2017, and so that we are ready to act proportionately as and when a cyberattack may occur"
3388," With thousands of unvaccinated covid19 patients in our hospitals, appalling attacks on NHS workers, and misinformation about the vaccines circulating readily online, what is the Secretary of State doing nownot in a years time, not when the legislation is finally enactedto properly address misinformation about the covid19 vaccines online"
3389,"In 2015, I visited Ukraine and Kiev with the then Defence Secretary, when I was a special adviser, to see Operation Orbital begin"
3390, That is remarkably similar to what Hitler said about the Sudeten Germans in the 1930s
3391," It committed the cardinal sin of wanting to move towards becoming a more free and democratic society, and when Yanukovych attempted to suppress that, the Ukrainian people turned out in their thousands to protest, and 100 died under sniper fire in the Maidan"
3392," Friend the Member for Gainsborough Sir Edward Leigh, it is worth saying that the Kiev International Institute of Sociology did a poll in eastern Ukraine and found that support for Russia had halved from 80% to 40% since Donbass was effectively invaded by Russia"
3393," Friend says that is music to President Putins ears and he can exploit thatbut this country is also a signatory to the 1994 Budapest agreement, which allowed Ukraine to give up its nuclear arsenal and have its borders protected by Russia, by us and by other countries, so I argue that we have a responsibility to Ukraine that falls outside our membership of NATO"
3394," Last month, we set out our new national cyber strategy, backed by £2"
3395,"6 billion of funding, to help to protect the United Kingdom and our international partners"
3396, Our £1
3397,"4 billion investment in digital infrastructure is connecting people wherever they are in the UK; we are investing £850 million into local culture and £560 million into youth clubs in the places that need them most; and we are levelling up through sport with £205 million for community sport pitches, plus our flagship 2022 events such as the Commonwealth games and the rugby league world cup"
3398,I think Mr Speaker might call me to order if I start discussing Channel 4 on the back of a sports question
3399," There was no agreement by any party or any nation to prevent any free people from joining the NATO defensive pact in 1991 or, indeed, at any time"
3401," I am sure that he will come on to talk about the way in which the Russians are using gas and energy to manipulate and coerce our key NATO partners in central and eastern Europe, such as Poland, with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline"
3402," I remember returning to Poland to see my beloved grandfather in 1983, when martial law was finally lifted, and saw at first hand what the Russians did to the country of my birth in the coercion, manipulation and control of this country of central and eastern Europe"
3403, There is no greater manifestation of that than the Nord Stream 2 pipeline
3404," We have heard many times about the current poor American leadership and the flipflopping that has occurred on the part of President Biden on the issue of Nord Stream 2, and indeed his pandering to Germany and others in allowing this pipeline to materialise"
3405," Members to know that Poland has invested billions of dollars in a liquefied gas terminal in winoujcie on the Baltic coast, and so has Croatia"
3406," When Romania and Bulgaria joined in 2004, we heard those same calls"
3407, I have been very clear about our position on Nord Stream 2
3408,"The Foreign Secretary referred in her statement to her opposition to Nord Stream 2, but we know that as Putin turns off the gas taps in Moscow, there is an impact here in the UK, where families are facing a potentially crippling 50% increase in their energy bills"
3409, It is cashing init announced a £179 million dividend earlier this week
3410," In fact, I think that 3% of our gas is from Russia, but I agree with the hon"
3411,The 1994 Budapest memorandum is very clear
3412," If something were to go horribly wrong in Ukraine, however, the next domino in the chain would be the Baltic states, with which we have an article 5 guarantee"
3413," We will bring forward legislation that introduces criminal sanctions, including pretty steep fines10% of global annual turnover, which could be as much as £18 billion, so they will be considerable"
3414," That is part of around £400 billion of direct support for the economy, which has helped to safeguard jobs, businesses and public services"
3415, We have also provided an unprecedented £1 billion to ensure the survival of grassroots professional support and leisure sectors
3416," I do want to try to get everybody in, but we need to finish the exchanges on this statement by around 5"
3417," We are trying to establish a core of a P5 consensus although that is not entirely straightforward, and then we will want to consider all the different regional partners, which do not all have perfect relationships with each other"
3418," That includes more than 8,000 British nationals; close to 5,000 Afghans who loyally served the UK, along with their dependants; and about 500 special cases of particularly vulnerable Afghans, including Chevening scholars, journalists, human rights defenders, campaigners for womens rights, judges and many others"
3419," At the same time, the Government launched the Afghan relocations and assistance policy scheme for interpreters and other Afghan staff, getting more than 1,900 out before the airlift began on 15 August"
3420," On 30 August, the UN Security Council passed resolution 2593, driven by the UK alongside the US and France, affirming the international communitys expectation and requirement that the Taliban should follow through on the assurances that they have given"
3421, I also announced that we are sending £30 million in support to Afghanistans neighbours
3422, The UK has allocated £286 million in aid for Afghanistan this year
3423," Could he have a word with the Home Secretary and get it dealt with He was not able to tell us how many British nationals are still there, but I imagine he must know by now, so can he tell us We know that only one security guard from the embassy got out, so what is his plan for the rest I did a quick check before I left my office today; there are still hundreds of unanswered emails from MPs, and many of them raised that question with the Prime Minister this afternoon"
3425," Can he tell us how many have done so How will the Government decide who is going to get into the 5,000 cap The criteria for the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme are yet to be announced, but we know that it is for those who are highly vulnerable to the Taliban because of what they have done in support of the values we and the previous regime were committed to, in particular, women and girls, equality, democracy and human rights"
3426," There are bound to be so many more than 5,000, so how will the Government in practice decide between those who will be the lucky 5,000 and be allowed to come here, and those who, although meeting the criteria, will, because of the 5,000 cap, be refused and face a terrible fate at the hands of the Taliban The reality is that the unless the Government increase the 5,000 cap, the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme is going to end up as a lottery of life and death"
3427," In answer to his question, in  that period from April onwards we relocated nearly 2,000 people"
3428,"As of this morning, I had received urgent, heartbreaking pleas from 289 constituents of mine about well over 1,500 of their loved ones desperate to get out of Afghanistan"
3429,"The Governments Nationality and Borders Bill would see hundreds, possibly thousands, of Afghan asylum seekers arriving in this country in the months ahead and being prosecuted in criminal courts and imprisoned for up to four years"
3430,"The Government say that the number of British nationals left in Afghanistan is in the low hundreds, but in my constituency alone, I have 11 constituents stuck, including an 18monthold baby, many of whom witnessed horror at Kabul Airport and, fearing the Taliban, they are now petrified and in hiding"
3431,"In the last quarter of 2020, the Home Office was rejecting more than half of all asylum applications from Afghan nationals"
3432,"Does the Foreign Secretary believe he would be more successful in his attempts to persuade the neighbouring countries of Afghanistan to keep or indeed make sure that their borders are open to refugees if our country took more than a desultory 5,000 as a limit, and saw that as a minimum number of refugees we would take rather than a maximum"
3433," Gentleman makes, but I think there is no country proportionally doing more, if we take not only what we are doing on the resettlement scheme, but the 17,000 who have come back to the UK and the £30 million that I announced at the end of last week to support those third countries"
3434," We know that there are thousands of orphans stranded in Afghanistan, and they are at risk of radicalisation and abuse"
3436," Since 19 August, we have answered well over 90%93%of the total number received, and on every day since 24 August, our call handlers have answered more than 94% of the calls that were made"
3437," As I announced last week, we have provided £30 million for neighbouring countries to deal with refugees in the region precisely because it is better for refugees to be dealt with closer to their home, but also because we recognise the burden that will be placed on the region"
3438,The positive impact of 20 years of education for millions of girls and young women in Afghanistan has changed countless lives for the better
3439,British aid allowed 10 million more children to get access to a decent education over that last 20 years
3440," We are also committed to very significant funding for arts and music projects, with £620 million over the past three years, including £79 million for the 119 music education hubs and £148 million for the music and dance scheme"
3441,"It is, of course, our intention that exams will go ahead in 2022"
3442,"That the draft Environmental Authorisations Scotland Regulations 2018 Consequential Modifications Order 2021, which were laid before this House on 8 June, be approved"
3443," Those are probably more for the Home Secretary than for me, but let me tell him that the plan is for 5,000 to be resettled this year, with 20,000 over the course of the next few years"
3444," I believe we are right not only to lead by example in the way I have described and, on aid, to provide the £30 million to the neighbouring countries so that we can support them in taking those refugees, but to use that leadership by example to corral and cajole other countries to step up"
3445," What is the timeline for setting up this contact group and what will be the specific criteria for membershipcounterterrorism, humanitarian, nation building Also, will the format be based on P5 plus region and plus other countries from the middle east to get the money"
3446," Gentlemans Department provide a risk and needs assessment to help the Home Secretary draw up the figure of 20,000 as the proper number of people to be resettled What advice is it providing about identifying the 5,000 most in need to come in the first year What advice is it providing to the Home Secretary about selecting the next 15,000 They need help, but not for a few years apparently"
3447," If we had just made a year 1 commitment, he would probably be saying, But what about year 2, year 3 and year 4 I think it is right that we look at both the short term and the medium term, and the Home Secretary will set out full details in due course"
3448," To support that, councils have been able to draw on more than £6 billion of unringfenced direct Government funding to help them with the immediate and longerterm impacts of covid19 spending pressures"
3449," We worked on Step Up to Social Work and Frontline, which delivered thousands of new entrants into the social care system"
3450," Since 2017 we have seen an uplift of 10% in the social care workforce, which I hope she will agree is to be commended"
3451," In the first quarter of next year, there will be a reduction in that bureaucracy; that is coming down the line even before the review"
3452," Not that long ago, only about 37% of local authorities had a good Ofsted inspection"
3453, That 37% has now risen to 57% of local authorities that have a good inspection
3454," It was voted through by Parliament in 1995, and there have been changes in the last decade"
3455, I think that they will have seen the £407 billion package provided by this Government to support taxpayers
3456, Is he aware of the very widespread alarm that clause 9 is creating up and down the country
3457,"org by my constituent Mr Kashif Iqbal has now got over 150,000 signatures calling for the removal of clause 9 to ensure that British citizenship cannot be stripped from our constituents in this manner"
3458, Members that this debate has to finish at 4
3459," I certainly hope that the Government will consider new clause 4 carefully, but I want to focus on new clause 9 and the impact that the change in notification of revocation of nationality has had"
3460, Clause 9 is not
3461," I will reduce the time limit to just three minutes, because I want to try to get as many people in as I possibly can, and I will ask the Minister to respond to the debate no later than 4"
3462,"On new clause 4, is it not the case for this very explicit group of people, who have given loyalty and service to this country in standing for freedom, liberty and the  rule of law, that it would be deeply ironic and unjust if we were to leave them to the vagaries of a regime that has turned out to be entirely opposite freedom, liberty and the rule of law That is why we owe them this duty of care, if they choose to take it up"
3463," Member for Haltemprice and Howden Mr Davis, which would remove clause 9"
3464," The point about clause 9, which the right hon"
3465, It is perfectly legitimate for Government Back Benchers to point out that the genesis of removal is to be found in the 2002 ActInterruption
3466, My answer is that the British Nationality Act 1981 gives too much power to the Home SecretaryInterruption

3469," Why is this needed I would illustrate that with one casethat of 20yearold Tony Chung, who has been handed a prison sentence of more than three and a half years"
3470,"I rise to speak to new clause 4, which would secure the right of abode of the brave and loyal servicemen who served Queen and country in the British military, in the Hong Kong Military Service Corps and the Hong Kong royal naval service corps, until 1997"
3471," That is a very low number of people when compared with the 3 million citizens affected by the changes made last year to introduce the BNO passport, which was such a welcome support for the people of Hong Kong"
3472,999% of cases
3473," There are millions of people who potentially might be affected, and that is why reassurance is required to make clear that this is purely about a very simple business of notification when a person is unreachable or in a war zone"
3474," Between 2006 and 2018, 175 people lost their citizenship on national security grounds, but 104 of those instances occurred in just one year, 2017"

3481,The Chagos islanders have suffered over half a century of consistent injustices
3482," They were forcibly exiled from their homeland, the Chagos islandsDiego Garcia and outer islands such as Peros Banhosby the Harold Wilson Administration in the late 1960s to make way for a military base, and they were typically relocated against their will in Mauritius, but also in the Seychelles and other locations"
3483, It is the sort of thing you would expect to read in the history books of colonialism of several hundred years ago
3484, We have heard a lot about over 3 million BNOBritish national overseascitizens in Hong Kong with a potential right to settle in this country as a result of the increasing Chinese erosion of democracy there
3485," With the Chagos Islanders, only numbers in the hundreds to low thousands would be eligible"
3486," Gentleman could cast his mind back to the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, where, for the first time, people who had acquired British citizenship through birth were made subject to citizenship deprivation powers"
3487," Clause 9 is about peoples citizenship, identity and, ultimately, rights; without citizenship, people do not have rights, and that leaves them without an identity or a sense of belonging"
3488, The Home Office confirms that the cost of registration is only £372
3489," The remaining £640 is, therefore, money made after delivery of the service"
3490," I strongly urge Members from all parts of the House to carefully consider new clause 8, tabled by my hon"
3491," New clause 5, in the name of the right hon"
3492," That is particularly true for younger Hongkongers who have fled the country over fear of repercussions, as those born after 1997 do not hold BNO passports, and are therefore unable to settle in the UK via the BNO route"
3493," Those documents were issued to citizens following the handover of Hong Kong from the UK to China in  1997, so those aged under 24 cannot benefit from the BNO scheme"
3494," Again, the Opposition proposed that in Committee, and naturally we fully support new clause 5"
3495," By accepting new clause 5, they could take a significant and immediate step towards that, with the Oppositions support"
3496," We already have a couple of hundred of people in the asylum system, and if Ministers could find, or if we could find, another route, that would take a bit of pressure off the asylum system"
3497,"I want first to acknowledge my support for new clause 8, which my hon"
3498, It seeks the removal of clause 9tabled by the Home Secretarywhich would deprive UK nationals of citizenship without notice

3501," I want to speak about clause 9, which has been mentioned several times during the debate"
3502, We are raising genuine concerns on behalf of our constituents and their families
3503,I wish to focus on clause 9 but will refer to amendment 12
3504," The power to deprive an individual of their citizenship has been available for more than a century, since the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914, and is currently also contained in the 1981 Act"
3505, Home Office powers to strip British nationals of their citizenship were introduced after the 2005 London bombings and broadened in 2014
3506,"I was proud to add my name to new clause 8, tabled by my hon"
3507, It amounts to a fundamental rejection of our international obligations under the 1951 UN convention relating to the status of refugees and does nothing to resolve these complex issues at all
3508," The racialised nature of this tiered system is obvious the citizenship of those like myself, many of my constituents and millions of others of minority and migrant heritage is less secure and less important than those who belong to majority ethnic groups in the United Kingdom"
3509," I absolutely support new clause 2, tabled by the hon"
3510," We did wrong to the Chagos islanders in the 1970s and 80s when they were driven off their land, and we have done wrong by them many times since then"
3511," Government amendments 17 and 18, in relation to deprivation of citizenship, are minor and technical amendments to correct a drafting error in clause 9, so this is an appropriate opportunity to address amendment 12 tabled by my right hon"
3512," It amends section 40 of the British Nationality Act 1981 to allow the requirement to give notice of a decision to deprive a person of their citizenship to be disapplied in certain limited circumstances, such as where there is no way of communicating with the person"
3513, The Governments minor amendments to clause 9 clarify that the statutory right of appeal in deprivation cases is a right to appeal against the deprivation decision itself and not the deprivation order
3514, The 1981 Act provides a statutory right of appeal against a decision to deprive
3515, Clause 9 preserves that right of appeal in cases where the notice of a decision to deprive has not been served
3516,"Amendment 12 would remove clause 9 in its entirety, undermining the integrity of the immigration system and this Governments efforts to keep dangerous people out of this country"
3517," We will continue to consider what more we could do, particularly given the low uptake of the £40 million Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office fund designed to assist this diaspora community, and we will certainly be keen to look at that and, potentially, at how it could allow those people to settle here in the UK"
3518," He mentions traineeships, which are fantastic initiatives with a 75% success rate in helping young people and a great example of our plan for jobs in action, spreading opportunity right across the country"
3519," It has conducted webinars for well over 1,000 haulage businesses and it sends monthly emails to more than 14,000 hauliers on the next steps"
3520," There are currently 1,000 places available each year, and the scheme is substantially undersubscribed"
3521," I should also point out that new clause 7 itself would see the applicant, if they left  NHS employment within three years, having to pay the fee"
3522," Within the sample, 90% of Indian and Sri Lankan parents had chosen to contact the high commission to obtain letters to show their child was in fact not a citizen, and so clearly had no problem in approaching their authorities"
3523," In many cases, the parents had, I think it is safe to say, a chequered immigration record, with only 16% of parents having permission to be in the UK at the time of the childs birth"
3524," In 67% of the cases, the parents had obtained leave to remain in the UK as a result of the childs applications"
3525,"1 The Secretary of State must, within six months of the date of Royal Assent to this Act, make regulations exempting relevant persons from the payment of fees in respect of the exercise of functions in connection with immigration or nationality under section 68 of the Immigration Act 2014"
3526,"Amendments made 28, page 21, line 29, leave out 2 and insert 1A"
3527," Section 8 requires decisionmakers to take into account, as damaging a claimants credibility, certain types of behaviours, such as behaviour designed to mislead or not acting in good faith"
3528," We support new clauses 4 and 5 on Hong Kong citizens, new clause 7 on health care workersit seems a bit of a cheek to be charging people for the privilege of putting themselves at risk fighting the pandemicand those amendments and new clauses from the Joint Committee on Human Rights"
3529," My new clause 4 would secure those objectives and finally give these servants of the Crown the right to be treated as fully British, which is no less than they deserve"
3530," Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden Mr Davis, which would remove clause 9, is a quite straightforward legal matter"
3531," Member for Enfield, Southgate Bambos Charalambous, the Labour Government, through the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002as well as through further legislation in 2016codified and ensured that a Home Secretary of whatever political party had the power to exclude or take away somebodys citizenship in certain circumstances"
3532," If the Labour party opposes in principle what the previous Labour Government did in 2002 and 2016, I am certain that its FrontBench team would have tabled an amendment"
3533," There is a requirement for exceptional circumstances in clause 9, which are there to protect them, and no one has anything to fear from the clause at all"
3534,"I wish to support new clause 8, tabled by my hon"
3535," The fee of £1,330 is almost four times the cost to the Home Office of processing an application"
3536, Sometimes people lose their jobs because they do not have leave to remain between one twoandahalfyear period ending and the Home Office getting round to granting the next
3537," Lockdown happened in one of the gaps between twoandahalfyear periods, and the fathers employer did not know whether it was allowed to furlough him under the new scheme, so it did not"
3538," I very much agree with him, but unfortunately they do not, and every two and a half years they have extortionate visa fees"
3539," How do people cope with massive fees For one family I know, we are talking about £14,000 every two and a half years in order to stay in the UK"
3540," According to analysis by the New Statesman, nearly  6 million people in England and Wales could be affected, and under this proposal, two in five people from an ethnic minority background are eligible to be deprived of their citizenship without being told"
3541," How can we trust the Government and the Home Office How can we trust them with the measures proposed in clause 9 Simply put, we cannot, and I therefore commend the right hon"
3542," Member for Haltemprice and Howden Mr Davis on bringing forward amendment 12, which would remove clause 9 from the Bill"
3543," We support that new clause, which concerns the fee£1,012 for a childthat people must pay to exercise their right to be registered as a British citizen"
3544," Members across this House, I have raised many cases on behalf of constituents navigating this inefficient,  ineffective and expensive system"
3545,"Even though the Scottish National party has fundamental disagreements with most of this horrific Bill, that is not the case for part 1, where we are in agreement with much of it"
3546," Members might be interested to know that, in 2018, the Home Office made profits of £500 million by charging £500 million more than it cost to process applications"
3547," The cost to the Home Office of the registration process is about £372 a person, but to the person applying, it is a minimum of £1,100 for children and £1,200 for an adult"
3548," I would like nobody to experience it, but I would urge Conservative Members to trust me when I say that it took him years to save up the £1,200, and he could not have saved any harder"
3549, Amendment 2 in the name of the right hon
3550," We are very much opposed to clause 9, which, as we have heard, grants the Home Secretary the power to strip UK nationals of their citizenship in secret and without advance warning"
3551, Does he share my concern that 93% of those who have been arrested just for being prodemocracy are young people We have a unique obligation to protect them and provide them with safe and legal passage
3552," The key point that arises from her remarks is that the British Government have, sensibly and rightly, introduced the British National Overseas visa, which allows people in Hong Kong who registered for that scheme before the handover of Hong Kong in 1997 the right to settle in this country"
3553,"I wish to speak to new clause 8 about child citizenship fees, which I am grateful has been signed by a number of Members"
3554," If the £35 fee introduced back in 1983 had risen in line with inflation, it would be only £120 today"
3555," Instead, we charge £1,012a fee that has doubled in the past decade, and which the Government have the ability to increase at will"
3556," I hope that, when new clause 8hopefullygoes to a vote, every other Member of this House will walk through the Lobby with me and show those young people that they have every single right to be here, that we will not continue to price them out, and that they should be able to access every single right, just like myself and the Prime Minister have been able to do"
3557," Member agree that, while the amendment is welcome and it would be an improvement on the current situation, it would still mean that young people born after 1997 were relying on the BNO status of their parents, and that that would disproportionately impact poorer Hongkongers and people whose families moved after 1997"
3558," It is likely that if this Bill had been law in the early 1970s, I would have been stripped of my citizenship as a young child"
3559," Household energy bills have increased by more than £230 since last winter and are set to increase even more early next year, and we have recently seen higher tax receipts from energy bills"
3560, I therefore call on Members from across the House to support new clause 2
3561, Member for Crawley Henry Smith in proposing new clause 2
3562," I wish to put on record the Oppositions support for the new clause, which seeks to rectify the longstanding injustice in British nationality law that affects a relatively small number of peopleChagossian people, descendants of the Chagos islanders, who were forcibly removed from the British Indian Ocean Territory in the 1960s"
3563, Members on both sides of the House will support new clause 2
3564, I will focus my comments on part 1
3565," Clause 9 provides the Government with dangerous and unprecedented powers to deprive UK nationals of citizenship, without warning"
3566," Through clause 9, the Government seek to amend the longstanding position under the British Nationality Act 1981 that an individual must be notified if they are to be deprived of their nationality"
3567,"I am a cosignatory to new clause 4, and I congratulate the hon"
3568,I rise to speak to amendment 12 to clause 9
3569," The UK was a very different country in the 1970s, when racism and farright marches were common and Idi Amin had just thrown the Asians out of Uganda"
3570," Clause 9 alters the requirement for the Home Secretary to serve notice on a person in cases where this would be impracticable, such as if they are in hiding or in the middle of a warzone"
3571, I will speak against new clause 12 and in favour of clause 9
3572,"The Government very much recognise the challenge that people are facing, which is why we have introduced a range of interventions, including the warm home discount; the household support fund, giving £500 million to local authorities to distribute; changes to the taper rate; and an increase in the national living wage"
3573, Households in the lowest income decile receive on average more than £4 in public spending for every £1 that they pay in tax
3574, Crimes linked to drugs in Scotland cost £750 million a year to investigate and prosecute
3576,The uplift in universal credit was always intended to be temporaryit was to help claimants through the economic shock and financial disruption of the pandemicand we now have the kickstart programme and a multibillionpound plan for jobs
3577," I understand it is difficult to break a manifesto promise, and the Prime Minister was clear that he was doing that in raising national insurance, but he also had a manifesto promise to address social care, which, since Tony Blair said he would address it in 1997, has not been done"
3578," Data from Public Health England estimates that two doses of a covid19 vaccine offers protection of around 96% against hospitalisation and that our jabs have prevented over 100,000 deaths, over 143,000 hospitalisations and around 24 million infections"
3579, Some 88% of people have had one jab and more than 80% of people aged 16 and over have now had the protection of both doses
3580," The strength of support was over £14 billion during the covid crisis, and the furlough support helped 900,000 jobs in Scotland at the height of the pandemic, which is nearly a third of the Scottish workforce"
3581, The top 20% of households by income will pay 40 times what the poorest 20% pay; the top 40% will pay half of the entire levy
3582," In 2018, the current shadow Minister for Social Care, the hon"

3584, Citizens Advice Scotland says that more than half those people are worried about being able to buy food
3585," The Joseph Rowntree Foundation says that about 150,000 working families on low incomes in Scotland will pay an average of £100 extra in tax while losing £1,000"
3586," What advice does the Secretary of State give those families on low incomes on where they should cut £1,100 from their family budgets"
3587, The proportion of schools rated as good or outstanding by Ofsted has risen from 68% in 2010 to 86% in 2020
3588," Between 2011 and 2019, the attainment gap between disadvantaged children and their wealthier peers narrowed by 13% at age 11 and 9% at age 16"
3589," In 2019, 82% of year 1 pupils met the expected standard for reading, compared with just 58% when the lighttouch phonics check was introduced"
3590, Over half of children are now educated in academies and 42% of schools are now academies
3591," Some 84% of academies are part of multiacademy trusts, or MATs, and as of August last year, there were 1,180 MATs, covering 7,680 academies between them"
3592," Of those, 70% oversee six schools or fewer, and 38% run two or three schools"
3593," Over the years, various scandals have appeared in the papers, such as trusts paying for the lease of a new Jaguar for their chief executive, trusts paying thousands for firstclass travel and highclass hotel rooms, and even trusts paying for transatlantic flights"
3594," We regularly hear of trusts chief executives getting huge salaries of £100,000 or £200,000and, in some cases, close to half a million pounds"
3595," Having previously been placed in special measures, Whitfield Valley Primary Academy in Fegg Hayes in my StokeonTrent North, Kidsgrove and Talke constituency is now rated good by Ofsted, and with outstanding leadership, since becoming part of the Inspirational Learning Academies Trust in 2015"
3596," I thank the previous Education Committee, which in a 2017 report found that there was a gap in assessing the performance of MATs not fulfilled by either Ofsted or regional school commissioners"
3597," In 2018, Ofsted trialled a new approach to inspecting academies that involved a number of inspections of individual academies from a MAT taking place over a period of up to two terms"
3598," In 2015, we saw the scrapping of plans for a carbon capture and underground storage plant in Peterhead, so I am simply seeking reassurance from the Secretary of State that the Acorn project will be one of two clusters to receive backing from his Government next month"
3599," We want Acorn to be one of the tier 1 projects, and we are pressing for that"
3600,"On Cambo, all our North sea oil licences are factored into the 2050 net zero plan"
3601," Last week, I had, as others have, constituents contact me on behalf of people who they served with in Afghanistan"

3603," It is intended to strengthen the security and resilience of all our public telecoms networks, be they fixed line or mobile2G, 3G, 4G, 5G and beyond"
3604," We have been insistent on this position, and that is why I ask that this House disagrees with Lords amendment 4"
3605," As I have set out, however, it would be inappropriate to agree to Lords amendments 4 and 5"
3606," I commend Lords amendments 1, 2 and 3 to the House and ask that the House disagrees with Lords amendments 4 and 5"
3607," Friend also agree that this did not come as a great shock to the Government It was all laid out in the 2013 Intelligence and Security Committee report on critical national infrastructure, but nothing has been done since then"
3608, We agreed that the entirety of Lords amendments 1 to 3 was broadly beneficial
3609, We looked at Lords amendment 5 and we understood the temptation to flag up the importance of the Five Eyes relationship
3610, That leaves us with Lords amendment 4
3611," Therefore, like the Chairman of our parallel Committee, I will not be voting against Lords amendment 4 tonight"
3612," That is what the Government promised in 2013 when the legislation was originally put through, for our Committees powers, and it is a promise that we expect them to keep"
3613, Lords amendment 4 on the diversification strategy is vital
3614," When people try to give the impression that the issue of telecoms security suddenly hit us like a bolt out of the blue because of Huawei, I suggest that they read the 2013 ISC report on critical national infrastructure"
3615," It is now in the hands of the Prime Minister to ensure that the memorandum of understanding is amended and is, as the Chair of the ISC said, in line with the Justice and Security Act 2013, which envisaged that we would have oversight if security went into other areas"
3616," With regard to Lords amendment 5 on Five Eyes review, we believe that the intelligence community will naturally  consider the views of Five Eyes partners as part of its reporting, so the new clause, although worthy, is not really necessary"
3617," In December, David Fuller was charged with the murder of two young women, Wendy Knell and Caroline Pierce, in the Tunbridge Wells area of Kent in 1987"
3618," However, Lords amendment 4 on network diversification is very strong, and I am minded not to support the Government on it tonight"
3619, Two consequential amendments to Lords amendment 1 set out the conditions for the 40day scrutiny period and ensure that that time cannot be disrupted by recess or Prorogation so that this House and the other place have sufficient time to scrutinise the code
3620," In 2010 the Tories inherited a secure, competitive and worldleading network"
3621," However, I will take the opportunity to set out the SNPs views on Lords amendments 4 and 5 and, importantly, briefly to reflect on why we are in the situation that we are in"
3622," Actually, that kind of ties in to Lords amendment 5 it is because of the mess that the Government have created in relation to Huawei"
3623," I respectfully suggest that, in relation to Lords amendment 5, it is almost akin to the fact that they have learned nothing"
3624," That, from my perspective, simply does not cut it, especially, as we have heard, when some £2 billion has already been wasted on this debacle, notwithstanding the economic impact of being so many years behind in the rollout of 5G itself"
3625," That, in many senses, covers Lords amendment 5"
3626," If I got the scope of it correctly, she was saying that Lords amendment 4 is far too narrow and would make the Governments life too difficult"
3627, Any guidance issued must be consistent with the duty in paragraph 17 of schedule 1 for the Secretary of State to have regard to the need to protect the independence of the OEP
3628," The decisions of organisations such as the Centre for  Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, which employs hundreds of worldleading marine scientists, will be based on deep expertise and often highly technical scientific data"
3629," Enforcement was a key part of the Dukes amendment and our version goes further, because it will dock in with the existing enforcement regime in the Water Industry Act 1991"
3630," Ofwat can issue enforcement notices that can direct specific actions or fine companies up to 10% of their annual turnover, running to millions of pounds"
3631," It estimated that the complete elimination of sewage discharges through storm overflows in England, which many are calling for more broadly, is likely to cost between approximately £350 billion and £600 billion"
3632," That could mean up to £1,000 on bills every year"
3633," I thank the Minister and the Secretary of State for their time speaking to the Opposition about the issue, and I am grateful for the Ministers words today putting our concerns on record, but I have to say that publishing an amendment at 5 pm last Friday did not really build trust, either among Members on both sides of the House who wanted to see the detail or among the stakeholders who were looking forward to scrutinising carefully what the Minister had to say"
3634," It is not sufficient to say, To deal with this properly will cost £600 billion, but to deal with tinkering around the edges will cost hardly anything on the side, and pretend that those are fair options to choose between"
3635," Although we have our own problems with outdated Victorian sewer systems struggling to cope with the once in a hundred years events that now seem to be occurring every two to three years, the fact remains that any profits made by Scottish Water are invested in the services and infrastructure of Scotlands waterways rather than the pockets of shareholders, and that Scottish Water does not carry the stratospheric levels of debt carried by English water companiesand that is the way the people of Scotland like it too"
3636,2 miles along it
3637," Yet again, the Minister quotes the £600 billion cost that she says dealing with the problem will cause, but the water companies say the cost is in the region of £13 billion to £20 billion using concrete storage tanks, or £20 billion to £30 billion more if they are accompanied by natural drainage schemes that bring wider community benefits"
3638, That compares with the £1
3639,2 billion already being spent by industry on overflows between 2020 and 2025
3640," Currently, a water company dumps 40% of all the phosphates in Windermere"
3641," If that goes down to 39%, there is no measure to say whether that is okay, so I assume the water companies will think that it is okay"
3642,We have been two and a quarter years bringing this enormous Bill through Parliament
3643,"I beg to move, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 4"
3644," Lords amendments 1 to 3 were tabled by my colleague in the other place, Lord Parkinson"
3645, Lords amendment 4 relates to reporting on supply chain diversification and Lords amendment 5 relates to reviewing actions taken by Five Eyes nations regarding highrisk vendors
3646, I will speak first to Lords amendments 1 to 3
3647," We carefully considered the Committees recommendation over the summer, and tabled amendments 1 to 3 in the other place to accept them"

3845,"Since the veterans strategy was published in 2018, we have been delivering for our veterans, including Op Courage in the NHS to support veterans with their mental health, the veterans railcard, and a national insurance holiday for those employing veterans"
3846,"A retired teacher in my constituency invested in a property in 2015, but just before Christmas, they were issued with a  massive bill for £200,000 for an increase in their costs, and remedial work on their property will cost a possible £9 million"
3847," However, let me go back to insurers not only are they increasing premiums by up to 1,000% for people who cannot really afford the premiums that they were paying before, but insurers are part of the problem"
3848," Friend the Member  for Hemel Hempstead Sir Mike Penning said, thousands of people will have received large bills and many will have paid them"
3849," On his very important point, I hope that the withdrawal of the consolidated advice note and its replacement with the BSIapproved PAS 9980 will play a part in helping his constituents  and others to be in a position once again to operate fully in the property market"
3850," The Secretary of State recognised that in the statement by referring to the extra £27 million for waking watches, but leaseholders will have already paid out thousands of pounds for waking watches"
3851," Gentleman outline what steps he is willing to put in place to ensure that the burden of the cost of replacing cladding is not on the tenants alone Too many tenants of onebedroom apartments are being asked to pay thousands of pounds towards this from low wages, while developers are sitting pretty"
3852,"Since last April, I have been seeking answers for a constituent in Cambuslang who has been trying to sell a flat between 11 metres and 18 metres, which was wrongly assessed to have failed the EWS1 form because of cladding"
3853," On the question of employment, there are some 4,100 jobs across the country in 230 companies, and the programme is particularly important to south Wales"
3854, I say that because it is emblematic of a catalogue of wasteful decisions such as the selling off of the Royal Naval Hospital Haslar in 2009 for £3 million when it had reportedly been valued at £52 million
3855," I think it passed maingate business approval in March 2010, around the same time that the National Audit Office was pointing out the multibillion pound black hole that the Labour party was leaving in Defence at the time"
3857," More than 2,000 people have come to the UK since the end of Operation Pitting, and we continue to work with partners in the region to facilitate the exit of more, through more routes"
3858," Tens of thousands dead, millions facing humanitarian disaster, democracy and human rights in tatters, and many of billions of pounds spentif that does not merit a full, comprehensive independent inquiry, what on earth does"
3859, Friend that speed and delivery here is critical It is now four and a half years since the tragedy in my constituency
3860," This project matters for our military capability and for the 4,000strong workforce in south Wales and across the UK"
3861, I urge the House to reject new clause 1 and amendments 1 to 10
3862,"That the draft International Organization for Marine Aids to Navigation Legal Capacities Order 2022, which was laid before this House on 2 November 2021, be approved"
3863," I also welcome the decision by the Mercedes Formula 1 team and Toto Wolff to discontinue sponsorship from Kingspan, the cladding firm, with immediate effect"
3865, He and I will know that the seven major housing developers do much good work but that in the last three years they made profits of £16 billion
3866," This is a victory for leaseholders, who will get up to £9 billion of support"
3867, Far too many leaseholders have been waiting for three and half years in purdah
3868," Meanwhile, the residents have been paying out £28,000 a month for waking watch for nearly four years"
3869," Will we see an end to the EWS1 forms or will RICS come back at us and say that we cannot possibly do that, as it has done before"
3870, I know that this announcement and this progress will be welcomed by residents of Vizion apartments in Milton Keynes as well as by thousands and thousands of others across the country
3871," Will there be a Government guaranteea letter or similar that they can use with estate agents and othersso that they can move on with their lives Finally, residents in a Putney building of just under 11 metres have been given a bill of £1 million for remediation"
3872, Friend on behalf of constituents who face those imminent bills
3873,It is four and a half years since Grenfell
3874, That is simply not good enough for the thousands of leaseholders affected in Southwark
3875," Will he answer that point, bearing in mind that the biggest social landlords have said that their new housing programmes will be cut by 40% over the next five years if they have to cover fire safety costs themselves Affordable housing is at particular risk, as yesterdays fire in New York showed"
3876," Can he provide reassurance to residents such as those in Banning Street in Romsey, where the building is sub18 metres,  the freeholder is a housing association and the defects are cladding related, that they will be swept up in his reforms They are looking at costs of £15,000 to £20,000 per leaseholder for new fire escapes, which may well not even be needed"
3877," For so many of those people, lack of an EWS1 form means that they cannot movethey are absolutely trapped"
3878, The managing agents failed to make an application to the initial £1
3879,6 billion building safety fund
3880, I was told in June that a new fund of £3
3881,"5 billion would be coming forward, but that is yet to materialise and leaseholders are already having to pay over £2,000 each towards the cost of this exercise"
3882,"The shadow Secretary of State said that we cannot make a building half safe, but some residential buildings are possibly more dangerous than others"
3883,"With the leave of the House, we will take motions 6 and 7 together"
3884," Member has made a powerful intervention on behalf of that cluster, which I am going to come up to see"
3885,"Will the Minister look at the opportunities to manage Britains longest river, the River Severn We believe that, if an holistic solution were found to managing Britains longest river, there would be a gross value added uplift in the west midlands of more than £150 billion"
3886," This month, research published in The Lancet found that by 2050 worldwide dementia cases will treble and cases will go up by 75% in the UK"
3887," In the CSR, we announced another £340 million for motor neurone disease research"
3888," There are the winter fuel payments, as the hon Gentleman well knows, and £300 for 8 million pensioners is worth £2 billion"
3889,30am and 2
3890,"The University of Sheffields new gene therapy innovation and manufacturing centre shows that South Yorkshire can lead the world when it comes to research, but nearly half of all RD spending goes into the golden triangle"
3891,"I am sure that the Secretary of State is aware that offgrid customers gas and oil supplies are not covered by the price cap, and that they will therefore experience even higher price fuel price increases this spring than the £600 or so now predicted for ongrid customers"
3892," Friend will know that there is a £450 million boiler upgrade scheme, which was outlined in the CSR, that will provide upfront capital grants for the installation of lowcarbon heating systems"
3893, She will also be aware that for lowerincome households we have a £1
3894,"1 billion home upgrade grant, which will upgrade energy efficiency and increase lowcarbon heating of nongas homes across the country"
3895,"As a result of this Governments longterm life science strategy, now a 10year strategy, I am delighted to be able to share with the House that the life science sector has grown, in terms of private investment, by 1,000% in the last 10 years and is creating jobs all around the UKin Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales"
3896," At the heart of our strategy for the innovation nation, in our life science vision last summer we set out a plan, with £5 billion in the comprehensive spending review of funding for life science research, and we intend to support those clusters all around the UK"
3897," Yet when hospitality businesses were losing, on average, £10,000 a week, the Chancellor was in California, with the Business Secretary nowhere to be seen"
3898," Alongside the £400 billion package of grants, loans, business rates relief, VAT discounts and rent moratoriums, we are providing £1 billionworth of grants and £100 millionworth of discretionary grants"
3899," The Night Time Industries Association suggests that its members have lost, on average, £45,000 over the festive period, so the grants do not touch the sides"
3900, Will the Minister commit to providing further financial support to this sector by reintroducing the 100% business rates relief and the emergency 5% VAT rate
3901," That scheme was resettling 5,000 people a year"
3902," On the question of Prorogation, would he mind turning his thoughts briefly to whether that was contained or referenced in the Fixedterm Parliaments Act 2011 and how that Act relates to this Bill"
3903," Gentleman is correct that if new clause 3his amendment to allow a vote on Prorogationwere agreed to, it would render Prorogation nonjusticiable in future, and that that is the intention"
3904," If she has regard to clause 3 and its inclusion of the words or purported in relation to the exercise of prerogative powers, she will be aware that there are some who feel that that raises the question of justiciability in relation to the Miller and Cherry cases"
3905," In my view, clause 3 does not do that"
3906,"But it is not actually five years; it is five years and a bit, is it not As the Septennial Act 1716 did, it goes from the date of the first sitting of the new Parliament"
3907," For example, the 2017 election, known to have been rather a long one, was considerably longer than that minimum statutory period"
3908, Friend back to the point about 2013 and why the period became 25 working days
3909,"Relevant documents Report of the Joint Committee on the Fixedterm Parliaments Act, Session 201921, HC 1046, HL 253, and the Government Response, CP 430; Sixth Report of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, Session 201921, The Fixedterm Parliaments Act 2011, HC 167, and the Government Response, Session 201921, HC 1082; Oral evidence taken before the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee on 23 June 2021, on the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Bill, HC 376; and Correspondence between William Wragg MP, Chair of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee and Chloe Smith MP, Minister of State, Cabinet Office of 21 July and 12 August"
3910," As we have heard, politicians and academics are still arguing about whether it is even possible to believe that the Fixedterm Parliaments Act 2011 had never been enacted"
3911," While that academic debate rages on and we are heading back to the situation prior to 2011, there can be no doubt that this Bill is little more than a brazen attempt by the Executive to entrench more and more powers with themselves, at the expense of this Parliament"
3912," So if the Scottish Government set a date for a referendum, say in May 2023, under this Bill, it would be entirely within the Prime Ministers power to set that date for a UK general election and consequently shift the date of the referendum in Scotland"
3913, I am therefore very sympathetic to new clause 1
3914," Some 50% of the population of London have graduatelevel qualifications, compared with 33% in the north of England"
3915, Our £4
3916,"8 billion levellingup fund and £220 million community renewal fund are both UKwide, ensuring that all parts of the United Kingdom benefit from this investment"
3917," We have signed heads of terms on all our 101 town deals, bringing £2"
3918,5 billion of investment into towns across the country
3919," Of those, 43 are in the north of England, with over £1 billion of investment combined"
3920, The £25 million towns deal in Barrow includes a new learning quarter that will transform the local educational offer in the town
3921," Following the elections in May in West Yorkshire, over 63% of the norths population is now represented by combined authority mayors"
3922," In Blyth, we invested over £20 million as part of the towns fund to help to foster regeneration, stimulate investment and deliver vital infrastructure that is so needed"
3923, That is in addition to the £11 million through the future high streets fund that we are delivering there too
3924," As part of that deal, Northumberland will receive over £12 million to support growth and investment, and a further £17 million has been committed to support the green energy sector in the borderlands too, subject to the final business case signoff"
3925," Gentleman talked about, we can see the £4 million of investment to upgrade to superfast broadband delivery to homes and businesses, while the deal is also supporting projects that focus on heritage"
3926," The triple lock has seen a £2,050ayear increase in cash terms"
3927," Before 2010, when the coalition came into power, the state pension was under £100"
3928, The new state pension is now £179
3929," We have raised it by £2,000 in the last 10 years"
3930," We did not even need to do anything last year,  but we raised the state pension by 2"
3931,"5%, and we will  be increasing it by the double lock if the Bill passes  next week"
3932, The UKs humanitarian response is one of the most ambitious in the world to date and builds on our proud record of resettling more people than any other European country since 2015
3933," Approximately 7,000 Afghan locally employed staff who served alongside our armed forces in Afghanistan, and their families, have been relocated to the UK under ARAP"
3934," Local authorities will receive a core tariff of more than £20,000 per person, which will be provided over three years to support resettled Afghans to integrate into British society and become selfsufficient more quickly"
3935," Funding will also be provided to support education, English language and health provision in the first year, and there will be a further £20 million of flexible funding in the current financial year to support local authorities with higher cost bases with any additional costs in the provision of services"
3936," We will therefore take a concessionary approach for Afghan nationals similar to that which we took for Syrian nationals in 2015, which will allow us to waive certain document requirements in some circumstances"
3937," We are not proposing to open this up as an applications process, because there are 40 million people living in Afghanistan, and I suspect that the overwhelming majority of them feel pretty vulnerable for various reasons at the moment"
3938,"What reassurance can the Minister give to the 3,000 Afghans who were in our asylum system prior to the fall of Kabul What lessons will she take from what other European countries are doing around a fasttrack system Crucially, can she give the assurance that under no circumstances will anyone be deported back to Afghanistan"
3939," I think that was the first time the Journal had been altered since 1621, when the King was so angry with the House for having debated the matter of his sons potential marriage that he ordered the Clerk of the House to bring the Journal to him and tore out the offending page"
3940, So I think that 1621 and 2019 are the two times that the Journal has been disturbed in that way
3941," At the time,  of course, Dissolution was not a prerogative power because of the Fixedterm Parliaments Act 2011"
3942," The Prime Minister and the Government had tried to argue that it was a proceeding in Parliament and, consequently, under article 9 of the Bill of Rights and the equivalent legislation in the Scottish Parliament, it could not be considered by a court"
3943," In Australia in 1975, the GovernorGeneral, John Kerr, removed the Labor Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, and then prorogued Parliament before the House of Representatives, which was controlled by the Labor party, could pass a motion of no confidence in Malcolm Fraser"
3944," In Canada in 2008, the Conservative Prime Minister of a minority Government, Stephen Harper, ordered a Prorogation to avoid a no confidence motion in himselfyet another example of the use of a process which I think is a means of trying to prevent proper parliamentary scrutiny"
3945, The Meeting of Parliament Act 1694 says that we should have Parliaments every three years; that is all that we would be relying on as a legislative means
3946," We not only had a constitutional crisis in 2019; we had one in 2010, too, which led to the coalition Government"
3947," That brings me back to the express purpose of clause 2, which delivers on the Bills purpose, which is, as I said, to reset back to the pre2011 position with as much clarity as possible"
3948," By making express provision to revive the prerogative powers, clause 2 returns us to the tried and tested constitutional arrangements, so I commend it to the Committee"
3949," That was the view of the courts, as expressed by, for example, Lord Roskill in the landmark GCHQ case in 1985 he considered that the courts are not the place to determine whether Parliament should be dissolved on one date or another"
3950," the Foreign Compensation Commission 1969, and Privacy International v"
3952, The decision in front of us is whether purported decisions relating to this area should or should not be included in clause 3
3953," Therefore, as I have said, the function of clause 3 is to set that out very clearly"
3954," I will now move on to clause 4, which deals with fiveyear maximum terms"
3955, It strikes me that new clause 2 would be the most straightforward and easy way to do that
3956," So what exactly are the exceptional circumstances in which the monarch can refuse a Dissolution request How can the Lascelles principles, which we heard earlier were prerogative powers, now be statutory powers I cannot see how this returns us to the position we were in in 2011"
3957," As I said, we share the concerns of many Members across the Chamber that the repeal of the Fixedterms Parliaments Act would not automatically take us back to the position of 2012 and we need a lot more clarity about exactly what legal position we would be in"
3958," It is advising a twostage process, and stage one is to offer the booster vaccines to those in the old 1 to 4 cohorts plus the immunocompromised, and then to groups 5 to 9"
3959," Let us say unequivocally that we believe the number of resettlement places on offer is a long, long way below what events in Afghanistan require of us, in the context of more than 2 million Afghan refugees, with many more to come"
3960," Outside the 5,000 in the first year, the numbers put forward by the Home Office are vague aspirations, not detailed plans"
3961," Will the Minister please heed the warnings by both the First Minister of Scotland and the leader of Glasgow City Council that the commitment to rehouse 20,000 in the long term and to resettle just 5,000 in the first year is clearly not sufficient Clearly, in the context of the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding, a far more ambitious programme is required"
3962," Successive cases across the centuries, starting in 1611, have proved that every prerogative power has to have a limit"
3963,"Because clause 3 is careful, as the explanatory notes set out, to absorb recent case law, as I am sure the right hon"
3964," The point still stands, none the less, that clause 3 is about Dissolution, having had regard to relevant case law"
3965, Friend the Member for Basingstoke Mrs Miller and amendment 3 in the name of the hon
3966," As I have explained, the Bill seeks to return us to the status quo ante while retaining sensible changes that have been made since 2011 to enable the smooth running of elections, which are, in my view, of benefit to voters"
3967," Before 2000, as I said, there was no postal voting on demand, and it has since grown in numbers to represent nearly 20% of registered electors"
3968," There have been campaigns to reinstate passenger services on the Ashington, Blyth and Tyne line since they were removed in 1964"
3969," It was the Labourled Northumberland County Council between 2013 and 2017 that got the ball rolling on the lines reinstatement, and we are all happy, across every party, to see the work begin to take shape, but restoring passenger services to the line will not help local communities if it takes people away from our high streets into north Tyneside and Newcastle"
3970," Nor will it solve the issues of isolation for those in communities such as North Blyth or Cambois who, despite living less than 3 miles from one of the new stations, have a bus service that does not run before 9 am and ends just after 2 pm"
3971," We have been careful to ensure that those people whom we can welcome, we can welcome and integrate well, which is why, working with local authorities, we have settled on the 5,000 figure"
3972," Friend the Minister but to the Home Secretary, whom I was texting barely half an hour before I came into the Chamber about an Afghan who is currently near a border, and she was personally sorting out the transit documents that I hope will enable him to come through"
3973," Friend agree that one benefit of clause 3, as well as highlighting all the issues that she has just mentioned, is that it makes it abundantly clear that Parliament is supreme"
3974," On that basis, I recommend that clause 4 stand part of the Bill"
3975," It introduces the schedule to the Bill, which makes provision for the consequential amendments that are needed to ensure that other legislation operates effectively once the 2011 Act has been repealed and we return to the status quo ante"
3976, The consequential amendments primarily reverse or alter legislative amendments made by the 2011 Act
3977," They remove references to the Act in legislation and ensure that, after the repeal of the 2011 Act, other legislation that links to it still works"
3978," For example, in repealing the 2011 Act, they reflect the fact that there will no longer be fixedterm Parliaments, so the concept of an early general election would no longer exist in law"
3979, It allows us to modify changes made by the 2011 Act and ensure the smooth running of elections by retaining sensible improvements made by that Act or subsequent to that Act
3980," As such, I recommend that clause 5 stand part of the Bill"
3981," Members have spoken, but I will leave new clause 1 and amendment 3 there"
3982," Even under the 2011 Act, extraordinary elections to the devolved legislatures could be combined with all kinds of parliamentary elections, both scheduled and socalled early ones"
3983," New clause 1 deals with the particular issue of the election campaign itself, but there is also the additional period of time that we colloquially call the washup, which can last for days or weeks, and it feels like months sometimes"
3984," At the last general election it was a total of 36 days, and indeed in 2015 it was 37 days, so almost two weeks longer than when I was elected"
3985," I voted against the Fixedterm Parliaments Act in 2011, when it was brought in, and I seem to recall saying then what I hear the Minister saying from the Front Bench now that it would not work and that it was an abominable intrusion and distortion of our constitution"
3986," In 1997, the Labour party was elected"
3987," I was in the House some years later, and I recall vividly how the Labour party steamrollered its constitutional  changes, including the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, through this House with very little by way of consideration and regard for alternative voices"
3988, 2 should stand
3989," There comes to mind, for example, the Adams case, in which Mr Gerry Adams was effectively acquitted of his convictions in 1975 because the Supreme Court held that the Carltona principle in effect did not apply to the decision then taken"
3990, He was talking about the principles in another closely contested election period1950 and 1951
3991, I am also grateful for her engagement with those of us who signed new clause 1
3992, That is why I was happy to put my name to new clause 1
3993," It did not work for us in 1997 when I was a teenager, but it got the job done and let the country move on"
3994," Between 201415 and 201920, the northeast saw child poverty increase from 25% to 37%, with figures in my constituency mirroring the regional average"
3995," But the Government are still pushing ahead with their cuts to universal credit that will take money out of these families pockets, and more than £7 million a year out of the local economy"
3996," They are pursuing a double whammy that will see lowpaid families in work taxed to fix childcare, rather than the millionaires and the Tory donors"
3997," Friend the Member for Jarrow Kate Osborne mentioned, life expectancy has stalled, something not seen since the early 1900s, and it remains lowest in the north and the midlands"
3998," Marmots most recent report, which focused on Greater Manchester, showed a covid mortality rate 25% higher than Englands average"
3999,45 million
4000, The Institute for Fiscal Studies has shown that the backlog could reach 14 million if urgent action is not taken soon
4001, The northeast had by far the lowest percentage of workers who were able to work from home in the past year and a half
4002," Changes to the way pupil premium funding is allocated by amending the date at which free school meals are counted has left one school in my constituency £88,700 worse off"
4003," What will the Government do to stop those with the lowest healthy life expectancy and the lowest life expectancy from being taken out of a pension system that they have paid into all their livesweek in, week outfrom their employment They might not even get a halfpenny because of the level of life expectancy in their area"
4004, They might not get a halfpenny back from what they have put in
4005," In many parts, average house prices are much lower than the £100,000 set by the Government"
4006," In London, bus fares are capped at £1"
4007,"55, and a day of bus travel in the capital is capped at a total of £4"
4008," Travelling in my constituency between Morpeth and Ashington, which is roughly 6 miles, costs £6"
4009," Whether it is the work we are doing with the Department for Education on the Skills for Jobs White Paper and the lifetime skills guarantee, our devolution of the adult education budgetmore than £308 million this yearor the money we are redistributing for the local government finance settlement, with £240 million of equalisation this year, we are straining every sinew to support the north of England and level up right across the country"
4010, Young people are commencing roles daily and thousands are starting each week
4011," There are now 200,000 fewer pensioners in poverty compared with 2010"
4012," Rates of material deprivation among pensioners are at a record low, falling from 10% to 6% in the last 10 years"
4013, Older women in particular find themselves in relative poverty because 30% completely rely on the state pension for their income
4014, That makes the recent findings by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman about maladministration by the Department and its failure to inform 1950sborn women about changes to their state pension allowance particularly galling
4015," On behalf of other members of the Joint Committee, I particularly thank the Minister for her incredible hard work throughout the passage of the Bill, despite the other challenges she was facing at the time"
4016, I personally   thank her for her words in response to new clause 1
4017,I have written to three different Government Departments seven times since 23 August on behalf of a constituent of mine whose family members are in Afghanistan
4018,"The Minister spoke about the ways the scheme will prioritise those who have assisted UK efforts, but what does prioritisation actually mean Those who will be admitted on to the list of 5,000 in the first year need to know whether they are being prioritised, as that may affect their decision to travel to the border, or the way that people respond in Afghanistan, as well as those refugees outside it"
4019," The Minister will know that the criteria she set out would probably just about meet the 4,500 relatives of my constituents, every one of whom would qualify on that basis"
4020," Gentleman will know, I hope, that we have had many thousands of people to rehouse out of quarantine very quickly"
4021,I rise to speak in particular to new clause 1 in the name of my right hon
4022," Rather than my pushing new clause 1 to a vote, I hope she might indicate in her comments that the Government will be commissioning research about the impact of the length of general elections on our democracynot just on voter participation, but on the broader democracyso that we in this place  can keep a close eye on how longer campaigns affect the quality of the democracy in our country"
4023," Gentleman that we want to drive up the standards, but he somewhat misrepresents the picture of improving quality of not only our roads, thanks to our enormous £27 billion investment in our roads, but of air quality as the standard of trucks gets better and better"
4024," Members may dislike the Fixedterm Parliaments Act 2011, simply voting for the Bill this evening will not automatically return us to our position prior to 2011 when that Act was introduced"
4025," New clause 2, and the idea that a general election could be called to dissolve Parliament and that that motion must be agreed by this House, is correct"
4026," It appears to me that if the Bill passes without new clause 2, the Prime Minister of the day will have full and unfettered control over the Dissolution of Parliament and the timing of any general election"
4027," Will the Minister unpack a little the £20,520 per person in core funding that she announced, and tell us what proportion of that she envisages being used for further education to enable people, where necessary, to upskill What conversations has she had with her ministerial colleagues at the Department for Education to see what more colleges in localities can do to ensure that these people are able to do what they aspire to do, which is to enter the workforce and be contributors"
4028,"We have today announced £20,520 per person over the next three years"
4029," We have, in addition, up to £4,000 per child for education and associated tariffs for medical care"
4030," The Minister talks about 5,000 people, which is one or two families per constituency"
4031,"How widely and generously will the definition of an assisted UK effort be applied I have cases of two interpreters who were told that they did not qualify for ARAP because they worked for G4S rather than for the Army, but if they had been properly assessed, they could already be here"
4032,"Diolch yn fawr, Dame Rosie; it is a pleasure to contribute to this debate, to serve under your chairmanship and to speak to my amendments 4 and 5"
4033, My amendments go one step further and would remove regulations from the Government of Wales Act 2006 that allow the Secretary of State to combine a UK general election with an extraordinary general election to the Senedd
4034," Despite the fact that we will celebrate a quarter of a century of devolved Welsh governance in a few years time, there continues to be a lack of understanding about which tier of government is responsible for which policy area"
4035," The Prime Minister mentioned a figure of £200 million, and today the Minister has mentioned the core tariff of £20,520 per person, but that is over three years"
4036," To put that in context, in the first 10 days, that helpline received more than 5"
4037,3 million attempted calls
4038," We have also had many thousands of emails, not just to the Home Office but to the MOD and the FCDO"
4039," Gentleman asked why there are 5,000 people in the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme"
4040," Members will understand that, having had the mass evacuation through Operation Pitting, we are quickly trying to find homes for thousands of people"
4041,"Does the Minister know that the Council for AtRisk Academics has been rescuing scholars under these dangerous circumstances since 1933 I appreciate the difficulties of those who are still trapped in hiding in Afghanistan, but out of the 16 who have research studentships or visiting  fellowships waiting for them at British universities and who have been validated by the council, one has made it to the Netherlands and three, at considerable risk, have made it undocumented into Pakistan"
4042, We also have the additional fund of £20 million to help those authorities that are telling us some of the issues they have with housing
4043,"In trying to justify allowing only 5,000 refugees in through year one of resettlement scheme, the Minister said that that followed consultation with local authorities, based on capacity and assimilation"
4044," Will she publish the collated  information that shows that, cumulatively, all local authorities in the UK responded that they could take only that figure of 5,000"
4045, Of course that is what the Labour Government did in the 1945 to 1950 Parliamentto get through legislation under the 1911 Act
4046," We know from our experience last week that the Government can suddenly pull an Opposition day because they do not want a vote on, for instance, universal credit and the cut of £20"
4047, I do not think it is fully clear from this half hour of quite warmtempered debate what other hon
4048, There is consensus throughout the House that the Fixedterm Parliaments Act 2011 has proven to be not fit for purpose and has been damaging to effective and accountable government
4049," We saw how, in 2017, a Government who commanded a majority in the House of Commons were able to call an early general election with ease, irrespective of the Acts intentions"
4050," Clause 1 repeals the 2011 Act and in doing so delivers, as I have already mentioned, on both a Government manifesto commitment and a Labour manifesto commitment to do so"
4051," By doing this, the clause delivers on the Bills purpose, which is to reset the clock back to the pre2011 position with as much clarity as possible"
4052," Friend help the House in respect of whether the Government acknowledge the existence of the Lascelles principles If they do, what is the impact of clause 2 on those principles"
4053, These amendments primarily reverse or alter legislative amendments made by the 2011 Act
4054, The schedule works with clause 6
4055," As I have explained, we want to make sure that references to the 2011 Act work elsewhere in other legislation"
4056, The 1985 Act provides no discretion or flexibility to further alter the date of the poll
4057, This would adjust the arrangements that exist under the 2011 Act by removing the twothirds majority requirement
4058," As we have already begun to touch on in this afternoons debate, the deadlock and paralysis created by the 2011 Act did rather demonstrate why a prescriptive statutory approach does not work"
4059," The 2011 Act attached confidence and the decision of the Prime Minister to call an election to statutory motions, which gave the Commons a direct say in Dissolution, but it is also possible to argue that those arrangements hindered the function of democracy by making it harder to have necessary elections"
4061," Under the Bill, once a general election has been called and Dissolution takes place, the election timetable in schedule 1 to the Representation of the People Act 1983 makes the provision for the timing of an election very clear"
4062," Before and under the 2011 Act, the date of the first meeting of Parliament was set by the sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister"
4063," In practice, Parliament has met within one to two weeks of a general election on all but two occasions since 1950"
4064,The Bill does two things it repeals the Fixedterm Parliaments Act; and reinstatesor attempts to reinstatethe status quo that existed before 2011
4065, New clause 5 would simply mean that Parliament would have to sit within 14 days of a general election
4066," If we go back to previous general elections, for example 2017, we would be sitting two weeks earlier and the Parliament would last two weeks less"
4067," I tabled an amendment to that effect in 2011, during the passage of the Fixedterm Parliaments Bill"
4068," I would appreciate it if the Minister, in closing, could shed some light on why the Secretary of State needs to retain the powers to combine extraordinary general elections to the Senedd on the same day as UK parliamentary general elections when provisions in section 5 of the Government of Wales Act allow the Senedd to dissolve itself and the Presiding Officer to propose a day to hold an election"
4069," The Fixedterm Parliaments Act 2011, which the Bill would repeal, was good for democracy as it strengthened the hand of this House in the governance of the UK"
4070,"I wish to speak against new clause 2, Dame Rosie, and it is a pleasure to be called to speak after having served on the Joint Committee that examined the Bill"
4071," At its heart, the Bill resumes a position in our democracy that has served us well, restoring the process for dissolving Parliament to the situation that existed before 2011"
4072, Professor Mark Elliott of the University of Cambridge observed in his evidence to the Joint Committee that clause 2 requires the courts to act as if the FixedTerm Parliaments Act had never been enacted
4073, Friends who served in the 2017 Parliament and they were incredibly frustrated with the dither and delay that covered this House in little glory in the runup to the 2019 election

4075, Members to reject Lords amendment 1B
4076,The debate finishes at 6
4077," The Government will report on the review as part of the covenant annual report in 2023, 18 months after the new duty is expected to come into effect"
4078," However, given the level of interest in the new duty, we will provide an interim update in the covenant annual report in December 2022, some six months after the duty is expected to come into effect"
4079," At that point, we will be able to say more about the scope and methodology for conducting the review, and MPs will have the opportunity to assess and comment in the 2022 covenant report debate"
4080," In the light of the commitment that I have given, I urge the House to support the Government in resisting Lords amendment 2B"
4081,"That the draft Consumer Scotland Act 2020 Consequential Provisions and Modifications Order 2022, which was laid before this House on 8 November, be approved"

4083,"The House knows that this Bill is vital it renews the Armed Forces Act 2006, so that the armed forces can continue to operate and enforce a system of discipline, and it also fulfils our commitment to further enshrine the armed forces covenant into law"
4084," Furthermore, from January 2022, we will start to record separately information about domestic violence and child sexual abuse in the service justice system, so that those, too, can be reported on in our spring 2023 bulletin"
4085," I understand that, but I do not see how that links to the issue addressed by Lords amendment 1B, which is essentially that, where the offence is committed in the United Kingdom, unless there is a compelling reason to the contrary, which might involve an expeditionary issue, there should logically be a presumption that the starting point is dealing with it in the civilian system"
4086," By rejecting Lords amendment 1B  in lieu, the Government are not only letting down women in the lower ranks, but undermining their own policy of seeking to recruit more women to the armed forces"
4087," The Army has committed itself to a 30% target by 2030 for female recruits, but has not yet produced a clear plan of how that will be achieved"
4088," The Armed Forces Act 2006, which the Minister mentioned, needs to be upgraded, so the Bill needs to pass in this House"
4089, I cannot for the life of me see how Lords amendment 1B creates any difficulty
4090," Lords amendment 1B accepts and rectifies this by leaving responsibility for the decision to the Director of Public Prosecutions, after consultation only with the Attorney General"
4091," I know that the 4,200 women who contributed to the Defence Committees inquiry and people across the countryboth military and civilian, and both men and womenwho believe in British values of fairness and justice will want the MOD to consider this point"
4092, That is my only question regarding the Governments objection to Lords amendment 1B
4093," The target of getting 1 million people a day their booster vaccine is unprecedented and may even prove impossible, but we applaud the ambition"
4094," I was brought up on Islay, with a population of 3,500 people, and even of those who were at school with me I can count no fewer than six who have lost their lives in the industry"
4095," Again, I put on record our gratitude for that hugely important piece of work, which we will use as a lever to accelerate institutional change to ensure that women can thrive in military careers, given that since 2018 every single role has been open to women to serve in"
4096,"We have provided £140 million of discretionary housing payments to councils, specifically to target that element"
4097," Friend the Member for Macclesfield David Rutley, has just said, there has been a significant investment of some £2"

4103," More than 1,200 fishermen working from Hull died in the first world war; 300 Hull ships were used as minesweepers and for searching for submarines, and by the end of the war, only 91 Hullowned ships were still afloat"
4104," Between 1939 and 1945, 191 trawlers from Hull were taken into military service, and 96 of them were lost"
4105," The determination of the headscarf revolutionaries to see full crewing of ships, radio operators on every ship, improved weather forecasts, better training for crew and more safety equipment led to the publication of the HollandMartin trawler safety report in 1969"
4106," Friend join me in paying tribute to his predecessor, who worked with me in 2011 to try to introduce safety stop buttons for deck equipment, which was one of the things that was entirely responsible for my late husbands death"

4108," The 1980s, 1990s and 2000s saw new requirements to improve safety"
4109," Those changes have had a significant impact on fatalities in fishing, which have reduced from 60 a year in the 1960s to an average of six in recent years, as we have heard"
4110," It is true that the numbers fishing at sea have reduced by about 45% since those days, while fatalities have reduced by 90%"
4111," On average, there are approximately 53 fatalities per 100,000 in fishing, set against 0"
4112,"5 per 100,000 for the general workforce"
4113," Equally, while the trade and cooperation agreement has provided interim rules on subsidy control in the UK since Brexit,  it does not apply to subsidies subject to the provisions of part 4 or annex 2 of the WTO agreement on agriculture, which relate to most agricultural subsidies"
4114," In the 1980s, it experienced on average more than 12 fatalities a year in its fishing industry"
4115," From 2017 to 2020, there were none"
4116," That is why the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the Sea Fish Industry Authority and the national fishing federations, partnered together in the Fishing Industry Safety Group, have the aim of eliminating preventable fatalities by 2027"
4117," To help fishermen think about how not to go overboard, in 2018 new health and safety regulations were introduced that require risk assessments"

4133," 4 bus into Scunthorpe town centre, then walk for seven minutes to Scunthorpe station, take a 39minute train journey to Grimsby Town, and then walk for nine minutes to the theory test centre"

4135," Under the new system, changes were inevitably made to the theory test centre estate when the contracts were awarded, but the DVSA has ensured that 100% of the population of Great Britain can travel to a theory test centre within 40 minutes or 40 miles"

4169," As early as 2009, President Obama had to send 17,000 more troops to counter that resurgence"

4176," It was worth it to go to Afghanistan in 2001 to get rid of alQaeda, it was worth it to spend the long years of hard sacrifice and service in Helmand province to expand education and security alongside our courageous interpreters, and it was worth it when the rising tide of geopolitics meant that we had to leave Afghanistan"

4181, This is the biggest disaster since 1956
4182, Friend for her work on behalf of her constituents and their family members in Afghanistan
4183," We deserve to know why the Foreign Office crisis centre was set up after Kabul had fallen, why crucial papers identifying local employees were left abandoned on an embassy floor and why thousands of emails from Members of this House addressing urgent cases are sitting unopened and unread in inboxes"

4192," While it is not necessarily the duty of Members of the House to understand the machinery of government, it is worth while them understanding that, when the Foreign Office has received emails, sometimes with the details of hundreds of individual cases, it is very difficult at times even to doublecheck to see whether those details have already been passed to us"

4222," For students who are at level 2 at 1619, there will be, thanks to our forthcoming consultation on level 2 and below, worldclass qualifications designed with employers leading to traineeships, apprenticeships or work, or, indeed, the opportunity to take up the Prime Ministers lifetime skills guarantee at level 3 and get the skills they want, that they might not have had the chance to gain at school"
4223, We have the multiply programme for numeracy skillsthe great halfabillionpound project initiated by the Chancellor at the spending review
4224, We also intend to help people who have level 3 to progress
4225,2 Proceedings in the Public Bill Committee shall so far as not previously concluded be brought to a conclusion on Thursday 20 January 2022
4226," This can be seen by the scale of our investment, with more than £191 million of UK Government funding being invested directly in community projects across Scotland"
4227," They  have also failed to explain how they cannot afford to act on their own, given that they have a record settlement this year of over £41 billion of block grantthe highest block grant settlement in real terms since devolution began"
4228," This is a vital investment, and the Defence Secretary and I have been deeply concerned about progress on this troubled project, which has been running for over 11 years since its commencement in March 2010"
4229," For example, an MOD safety notice in December 2018 said that design upgrades were required to reduce vibration, but this was not acted upon"
4230, Recommendation 9 relates to avoiding the concurrent running of the demonstration and manufacture stages in future projects
4231," We have a robust, firm price contract for the delivery of 589 vehicles at a cost of £5"

4233," This very advanced fighting vehicle project employs 4,100 in south Wales and across the UK"
4234,"5 billion programme that has been running for the past 10 years, has only delivered a couple of dozen vehicles and still has no definite date for completion"
4235," I cannot give a 100% guarantee, because one never can on a defence procurement programme, but we are a long way down the road on this programmeas we should be, given the number of years that it has taken to get us this far"
4236,4 Proceedings on Consideration shall so far as not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion one hour before the moment of interruption on the day on which proceedings on Consideration are commenced
4237," As we have discussed, it is a £5 billion project that was expected in 2017, but only a dozen vehicles have arrived, and people are being sent to hospital because of the vibration problems"
4238, It makes it difficult for me to call for defence spending to be increased to 3% to improve our defence posture  because of the threats coming over the horizon when money is spent so poorly
4239," A £41 billion programme of investment in equipment and support is going into the Army in the next 10 years, and £8 billion of that is new"
4240," It provides helpful definition and sources for the catastrophic failuresnumerous as they arein the management control issues, which have come to define the literally incredible £5"
4241,5 billion defence procurement fiasco
4242, Friend is right this is a £5
4243,5 billion firmpriced contract
4244, I am very clear that we have a contract that says that 589 vehicles will be delivered that will meet our requirements for a price of £5
4245," I see no reason why this  House or the taxpayer should pay more money to General Dynamics to produce 589 vehicles, when we have a contract for it to produce 589 vehicles to our requirements for £5"
4246, Gentleman is right that £3
4247,165 billion has so far been paid under the contract to GD
4248," Friend the Member for Wokingham John Redwood, this is a £5"
4249,5 billion contract
4250," We want a transition, and this Government are investing significantly, with £160 million in floating wind farms, £20 million for tidal stream and the £285 million next round of contracts for difference, but it is important that we do not lose our domestic oil and gas supply not only for energy, but for the whole range of purposes, including medicine and other vital products"
4251,"That the draft Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments 2005 Hague Convention and 2007 Hague Convention Amendment Regulations 2022, which were laid before this House on 16 November, be approved"

4253, Three hundred and fifteen votes were cast with no spoilt ballot papers
4254, Some 65% of people in Scotland say that the Prime Minister is totally corrupt and 65% of people in Scotland also believe he should resign
4255," Given that this coincides with a surge in independence, with more than half of the population in Scotland now supporting independence and the Scottish National party, does the Secretary of State agree that the corruption of the UK Government is driving Scots away from the Union If he were truly interested in saving the Union, should he not be joining the rest of us in calling for the PMs resignation"
4256," During the passage of the National Security and Investment Bill and the Telecoms Security Bill, Labour called for just such partnerships with countries that share our values to develop key technologies such as 6G"

4260," DCMS has continued to support the events sector throughout the pandemic, including through the £2 billion culture recovery fund"
4261," It is also the most successful, having delivered peace and security in Europe for three quarters of a century"
4262, The Prime Minister said that the project will create hundreds of skilled jobs
4263," Would he agree today that this initiative is in response to the increasing, constant competition that we now face I hope he now recognises that our peacetime defence budget is no longer adequate, and we will soon need to increase it to 3% of GDP if we are to contain the threats that now we face"
4264," One of the reasons that some of us have opposed our foreign interventions since 2003 is that we felt they acted as a distraction from many greater dangers around the world, including in Indochina, so this agreement is very welcome"
4265," By the way, the Type 26 frigate programme, which I have seen being built in Govan, is worth £19"
4266,"5 billion to this country and, like the nuclear submarine programme, will generate jobs for decades and decades to come"

4271, With the biggest uplift in defence spending since the cold war£24 billion2
4272,2% of our GDP now goes on defence spending
4273," I have no doubt whatever that it will bring hundreds of highskilled, highwage jobs of the kind that we want to see, and increasingly are seeing, in our country"
4274," I am delighted to say that Harland and Wolff has, as I understand it, just taken on another 1,000 apprentices for the first time in a very long time to get ready for exactly that strategy"
4275, We are hopeful that China will be able to go even further than its current commitment to get to net zero by 2060
4276, It is the biggest uplift since the cold war£24 billion
4277,"Yes, of course, although I remind the House that the carrier strike group is out there expressing British influencehard power and soft power8,000 miles away, which is something that very few other countries can do"
4278, This Government will do every single thing we can to make sure that every single barrier is removed in order to spend every penny of that £5 billion as quickly as we possibly can
4279, That is why I think the UK can be very proud of the massive commitments that we make£10 billion this year alone in official development assistance spending
4280, Friend talks about is a £9 trillion trade area in which the UK has an increasing diplomatic and commercial presence
4281," Friend that worldclass life sciences are vital, and I am pleased to confirm that we have already allocated £354 million in the spending review to strengthen the UKs life sciences manufacturing base, with particular emphasis on preparing for future pandemics"
4282, 1505 impairs the report
4283," The Member in question should have been afforded  the procedures under the fair trial arrangements laid down by Standing Orders because we, as Members, are exceptionally excluded from judicial review by article 9 of the Bill of Rights"
4284," The way that these things work in this House usually is that the Government find a Back Bencher who has credibility and make her take a measure throughit is often a heron behalf of the Executive, and that is what happened last time"
4285," I am aware that funding is available through the places of worship scheme to help to provide security against hate crimes, and that the Government provide Community Security Trust Jewish communities with £40 million of funding every year"
4286," I also note that the Muslim Council of Britain has repeatedly raised the funding they receive as not proportionate to the risks they face, especially since the Governments latest figures show that they are the target of 45% of all religious hate crimesthis is the greatest percentage of any faith group and double that of the second highest group"
4287," Friend is keen to make sure that Parliament has time to have its say, but we have had almost four and a half hours of debate on this issue already"
4288," Lady might have noted that I referenced in my speech the fact that corporation tax was going up to 25%, and banks will  be paying a higher rate than everybody else, who will be paying 25%; the banks will now be paying 28%, not  the 27% they are currently paying"
4289," We are also ensuring that we have a competitive operating environment for these banks, because the banking sector not only contributes to the economy but employs 1 million people"
4290," I have talked about the universal credit taper rate, bringing in an additional £1,000 for those in work who will benefit from it"
4291," We have also increased the national living wage, which will benefit people by an average of £1,000"
4292," In Hull and the East Riding of Yorkshire, we remember the devastation of the 2007 floods to homes, schools and businesses"
4293, We also remember the tidal surge of 2013 and the city being cut off from the M62 by a flooded A63 in 2019
4294," I hope these minimum standards would be along the lines of the highly successful  measures put in place by Hull City Council and those supported by the Association of British Insurers, which is calling for the Government to enact schedule 3 to the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 and align planning policy related to sustainable drainage systems, as recommended by the Climate Change Committee"
4295," First, it does not cover homes built after 2009"
4296, I do hope that the Government will be looking urgently and seriously at the 2018 proposals from the Committee on Standards in Public Life
4297, The first is about ensuring that no company or individual can gain an unfair advantage by paying  a Member of Parliament to advocate on their behalf
4298, It is he who has the Eton education and the millions in the Cayman Islands
4299," Let justice be done though the heavens fall, he extolled in this House in an almost Atticus Finchlike defence of his good friendhis good friend unfairly maligned and maltreated by this Housewho had just pocketed a cool half a million pounds and been found to have broken our rules in a consistent and egregious manner"
4300," It is essential to review the workings of the fair trial systemthe investigatory panelcreated under the Labour Government in 2003 on the recommendation of the Committee on Standards itself, which consisted of six Labour members, two Liberal Democrats and only three Conservatives"
4301, 1505
4302, I am delighted to say that since the strategy was published we have already launched a £200 million life sciences investment programme and established the life sciences scaleup taskforce
4303,What plans he has to further develop the A1 from Peterborough to Blyth
4304,The Government recognise the key importance of the A1 as a strategic northsouth link across the country
4305," Further improvements to the route, beyond those completed in 2009, will be considered as part of the National Highways route strategy process"
4306, Has there been any indication that an oral statement on this issue will come from the Chancellor or Ministers at his Department  I am ever mindful of the food price increase in my constituency of 20% and the energy price increase of 30%
4307, The cost of living has increased by 5
4308,"1%, so these things will have a great impact on each and every one of us across the whole United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"
4309,"As Leeds remains the largest city in Europe without a mass transit system, or indeed any kind of railbased system, surely the Secretary of State should stop pouring money into feasibility studies when they have already been carried out and instead give my constituents in Leeds North East some clarity by telling the House just how much of the £100 million from the integrated rail plan will be spent on a mass transit system for Leeds and west Yorkshire"
4310, Friend the Prime Minister also made this clear at questions yesterdaythat there will not be a 10% staff cut to the FCDO
4311," At £10 billion this year, the UK remains one of the largest ODA spenders in the world, as well as being well above the OECD average"
4312, There will not be a 10% staff cut and Ministers will make the final decisions on workforce changes in the spring
4313, He starts throwing around figures like 20% in terms of staff reductions in a clear attempt to generate scaremongering
4314," I have said, and the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have both said, that there will not be 10% cuts, as has been brought upInterruption"
4315," If abuse was being directed by someone shouting in the street, ultimately that person would probably be arrested and moved on, but it is difficult to control it when that voice of abuse is being amplified to millions of people"
4316," I commend their work, and I thank him on their behalf for his kind comments"
4317," We have committed £100 million to working on the best way to get HS2 trains to Leeds, and we must wait for the outcome of that work before lifting any safeguarding"
4318," I am sure the Minister will agree with me that, looking around the world and trying to find staff cutseven if not 10%, even if only a fewis still going to be challenging, because the reality is that we need more people now, not fewer"
4319, This is not just a question about a 10% cut
4320,"It should come as no surprise that there are reports that the FCDO is facing job cuts of up to 20%, although I have not yet heard from the Minister what those cuts will actually be"
4321," For example, we have seen the merger of the Department for International Development and the Foreign Officea merger that has yet even to integrate the IT and email systemsthe ideological death sentence cuts imposed by reducing the aid budget and breaking the 0"
4322,7% manifesto commitment and the chaotic response to the Afghanistan crisis in the summer
4323," This UK Government have routinely reneged on their commitments, and this staff cut, whatever the percentage will beI look forward to hearing itwill further erode the UKs diplomatic and development capabilities"
4324," Given the huge cuts to aid, and now the direct hit to the number of diplomats carrying forward the Governments incoherent vision for the UK abroad, is it not the case that the global Britain slogan has been laid bare as simply a fig leaf covering up the UKs retreating and everdiminishing role in the world Can the Minister confirm the actual percentage of the cuts as staff face Christmas with job insecurities"
4325, Gentleman throws around the figure of 20% staff cuts
4326,If he will ensure that funding for junction 10A on the A14 at Kettering is incorporated into road investment strategy 3 from 2025
4327,"Residents in Kettering, Barton Seagrave and Burton Latimer desperately needed this junction in RIS3 from 2025; otherwise, Kettering will simply grind to a halt"
4328," Friend the Minister for recognising the importance of the A1, but it shuts down at least once a week in my Rutland and Melton constituency patch because of accidents"
4329," Will the Minister please meet the A1 working group of MPs, so that we can explain why it is so important to upgrade the A1 to full motorway standard"
4330, The integrated rail plan committed £100 million to start work on the mass transit system and to look at the most effective way to get HS2 trains to Leeds
4331," However, it is worth noting that in addition to that, £830 million was allocated to the West Yorkshire Combined Authority through the city regional sustainable transport settlement in the autumn Budget, of which we expect £200 million to take forward the mass transit system based on the current proposals"
4332, Ofcom says that 50% of 10yearolds are on social media
4333," Actually, I will accept his compliment on behalf of the members of the FCDO across the network in my region and beyond, who are of course the primary means by which we deliver both diplomacy and development"
4334," While we are very proud of being a top tier ODAdonating country, with the commitment to go back up to 0"
4335,"7% set out in the spending review announcements, the integrated review does mean we will need to ensure that our posture globally reinforces that"
4336," I would like to ask the Minister whether he  believes that is because it is not a 10% cut, but actually a 20% cut"
4337," The Minister may not be willing to give us a number or a percentage of cuts, but can he assure us that the review in the spring will not involve compulsory redundancies"
4338," Will Ministers and the Secretary of State consider further prioritising our efforts in a country that is the size of Europe, that dwarfs all other South American economies, that produces 25% of the planets food, and that was one of the first to show us a hand of friendship post the Brexit referendum and is therefore well placed as a strategic ally"
4339,"The Leader of the Opposition has earned more than £110,000 since he became an MP; does the hon"
4340, There is no place in any democratic system for people who are put there by a Prime Minister just because they happened to give his party £3 million
4341," This would affect my local airfield in Coventry, which is meant to be redeveloped as a gigafactory that would bring thousands of jobs to my city of Coventry"
4342, It is quite wrong to imply that the whole country or the Government and  all the hundreds of civil servants involved in the awarding of those contracts are corrupt
4343," Friend will be aware that the UK Government recently granted £187,000 from the UK community renewal fund to help the project in his constituency to provide electric vehicle charging points across the Scottish borders"
4344," The UK Government will continue to support the installation of electric charge points through various schemes, including the £2"
4345,5 billion that has been committed to plugin vehicle grants and charging infrastructure programmes
4346,Included in the £2
4347,5 billion of extra funding that will be given to the Welsh Government this year is an allocation of money precisely to deal with the sort of problems to which the right hon
4348," Subsequent to that announcement, the Government awarded a £350 million contract to Randox"
4349, We have tested millions of people for covid19 and kept millions more safe

4351," Many thousands of pounds have gone to the Conservative and Unionist party from unincorporated associations such as the Scottish Unionist Association Trust, but loopholes in electoral law disguise the identity of the original donors"
4352," Does she still stand by that If so, how does she account for the Leader of the Opposition earning £100,000 from a second job in recent years"
4353," I give as examples the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000; the ministerial code; freedom of information; public registers of donations and national election spending; and the Electoral Commission, which this Government also seem to want to undermine"
4354," Those all came about because of the Labour Government, whereas in 2018, when the independent and external Committee on Standards in Public Life, set up to deal with the previous Tory scandal, recommended that the MPs code of conduct should be updated, the Tory Government ignored it"
4355,"If a Labour Government would be so keen on reforming the system, why did the last Labour Government do nothing to reform lobbying during their 13 years in power, and why did Labour vote against the Transparency of Lobbying, Nonparty Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Act 2014"
4356,"I can go back to the list of things that Labour did the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000; the ministerial code; freedom of information; public registers of donations and national election spending; the Electoral Commission"
4357,I am sorry myself that I missed that quote in Bristol in 1770whatever it was
4358, We should remember that the Prime Minister was interviewed under police caution on this matter back in 2006
4359," Members are picking up from their second job tens, scores or hundreds of thousands of pounds a year, and one cannot serve two paymasters"
4360," She already gets thousands of requests every year saying that an MP has not replied to an email, he or she has voted the wrong way, or whatever"
4361," They all involved the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, who seems to have been levelling up on his obligations to his good friend and leadership donor, David Meller, who he put in the VIP lane for £160 million of PPE contracts"
4362," Then she suggested, I think  it was in the Radio 4 interview, that it was up to 20 hours"
4363, It cannot and can never be right that someone can be rewarded with a place in the House of Lords for giving £3 million to the coffers of the Tory party
4364,"This is in the public domain, Madam Deputy Speaker if we look at the Leader of the Houses entry in the Register of Members Financial Interests, we see that, in 2016, he has an entry for January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August and September"
4365," As you will remember, Madam Deputy Speaker, we looked at the matter most recently in February 2015 when there was a scandal about a sting operation involving Jack Straw and Malcolm Rifkind"
4366," Whether we were paid £10,000, £82,000, £90,000 or £50,000, there would always be a constituency of people who thought we were paid too much and would want to tell us we were paid too much"
4367," When I was elected in 2010, I was a junior in the lawI was towards the latter end of a second six pupillagebut it was right that I had clients where I was instructed in their cases and there was potentially pay for those cases that happened a little after being elected"
4368," The idea that a Member of this House can spend time being an MP while earning almost a million quid a year on the side is utterly contemptible, in my humble opinion"
4369," When we think about higher standards, we must ask ourselves how does someone actually forget to declare £28,000worth of earnings for games of football they have recently officiated in Did he forget he was there Did he not catch himself on Sportscene highlights on a Saturday night and think, I had better stick that in my register come Monday morning Perhaps he was just too busy or perhaps he does not see the value of £28,000"
4370," When the average annual wage in Scotland is £25,000, I think that says quite a lot"
4371, One of her employersand well done to them paid all staff a bonus for their hard work and commitment during the pandemic of £300
4372," As she was a single parent in receipt of universal credit, this Tory Government, and their poorly devised policies, stole Lucys bonus right out of her back pocket and left her £75 worse off that month overall"
4373," When  I was elected to North Lanarkshire Council in 2015, I resigned from my job in the private sector"
4374," There are some good proposals in both the Boardman report and in the recent Standards Matter 2 report from Lord Evanss Committee, the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which say that we should make sure that Ministers commitments are made enforceable in law through a legal deed"
4375," The question mark with both recommendation 10 and recommendation 1 is actually how we define it, and various hon"
4376," One is that it does not mention recommendation 1, while the Government amendment includes recommendation 1 and recommendation 10"
4377," What gets me about this entire debate is that there are probably Members in here who would, as they say in some parts, go total tonto about me not wearing a tie, but who would not blink an eye at an unregistered £6 million in personal loans, or £28,000 of extracurricular activity in other Parliaments"
4378," How else would we explain the staggering £8 million earned by Conservative MPs in addition to their salary Yes, £8 millionI know that that will come as a huge surprise not only to the wider British public, but to many of us sitting in this House"
4379," The events of recent weeks have also lifted the veil on the open secret that many who come to this Chamber are here doing their least lucrative job, hiding the hundreds of thousands that they earn in plain sight because it has always been that way"
4380," In the 1960s it was centred on Members arranging call girls for their pals and spying, and now it centres on arranging phone calls for their pals and being economical with the truth"
4381," For me, it is absolutely, 100%, the constituents of Warwick and Leamington, Whitnash and villages"
4382," For that reason, the Nolan principles, established in 1995, serve as a fundamental, concrete basis for everything that we do"
4383," One Conservative Member is reported to have called for weakened environmental laws while earning £30,000 a year as chairman of a packaging lobby group"

4385, Member for Tewkesbury Mr Robertson is reportedly paid £200 an hour by the betting industry while seeking to warn Ministers not to introduce tough new laws on gambling
4386,"They say that a fish rots from the head down; is it any wonder, then, that so many Conservative MPs are happy to rake in thousands from private companies, given that as soon as the Prime Minister resigned as Foreign Secretary in 2018, he immediately retook his position at The Daily Telegraph at the staggering rate of £275,000 a year for one weekly column That is as much per word as someone would receive on a minimum wage"
4387," Member for Bromsgrove   Sajid Javid earned £320,000 in one year working for J"
4388, Morgan and C3 AI
4389,"The publics confidence in Parliament and their elected representatives has been dealt a grievous blow in recent weeks, following a torrent of revelations about the scale of corruption among those on the Government Benchesfrom the millions of pounds of taxpayers money handed out to Ministers friends for personal protective equipment that did nothing to protect frontline workers, through the scandal of cash for peerages, to the grotesque spectacle of Government Members voting to rip up the rules that govern standards in public life in a pathetic attempt to save their friend, the former Member for North Shropshire"
4390," Last year, as the MP for Liverpool, West Derbyrepresenting many of my constituents who are part of the 32% in Liverpool suffering from food insecurity, as outlined in the report, Feeding LiverpoolI, along with Baroness Shami Chakrabarti submitted a proposal for the right to food to be put into law in a meeting with Henry Dimbleby, the Government adviser leading on the national food strategy"
4391, It would have been far more difficult to organise if I were still a taxi driverof that I am 100% certain
4392," Let us imagine being on universal credit, seeing the pain of what the £20 cut has done to our family, and hearing the same Tory MPs who inflicted this inhumane policy line up to complain about their ability to exist on £82,000 a yeara salary that puts them in the top 5% of earners in this country"
4393," For Gods sake we have 15 million people in poverty, 4"
4394,"5 million kids going hungry, and, horrifically, a national pandemic that, in the past seven days, took the lives of 1,035 people"
4395," It was the gifts that we are sent by big business a food hamper from Heathrow,  with a letter asking me to back a third runway; a box from Googlenot much, although the companys letter told me about its supposed good work, but not the billions of pounds it has dodged in taxes"
4396, Why else do a third of UK billionaires donate to the Conservative party Why else do wealthy corporations hire MPs with ludicrous salaries for lucrative second jobs It is no coincidence that big business and the superrich have been handed tax cuts and dodgy deals worth billions by consecutive Conservative Governments
4397," Since the start of the pandemic, while our constituents have been pushed into poverty due to the Governments decisions, MPs have made more than £6 million from lucrative second jobs"
4398," In the past 14 years, the Prime Minister himself was paid more than £4 million for second jobsjobs which, I note, would not be banned by his proposals"

4404," I wrote to the Health Secretary and said that I would mention the fact that before becoming Health Secretary he was getting paid £1,500 an hour by a US investment bank"
4405," They might want more than £82,000 a year, but that is very different"

4408," Labour secured an Oppositionday motion in 2015 that called for an end to MPs holding paid directorships or consultancies, and 250 Conservativesmany of whom are still Membersvoted against it, along with 38 Members of the Liberal Democrat party"
4409, The recommendations were made in 2018
4410," Since I was elected less than two years ago, I have received more than 1,500 emails a month, I have sent nearly 40,000 emails back to my constituents, and I have spoken in Parliament more than 300 times and tabled more than 500 questions, alongside very regular meetings with constituents in Putney that inform everything I say in this place"
4411, Members who have taken part in the debate for their thoughtful contributions over the past threeandahalf hours
4412," The Government not only support the intent of the motion, but take a tougher stance than the Opposition in advocating, as we do, recommendation 1 of the 2018 report by the Committee on Standards in Public Life"
4413," Those recommendations, if they were to be adopted, would serve to allay the concerns that have been aired eloquently in this place and outside it, establish that the role of the MP continues to command the confidence of the general public, and ensure that the rules on outside activity reflect the fundamental principle enunciated eloquently by Edmund Burke in 1774 and many times since that, first and foremost, Members of Parliament have a duty to their constituents"
4414," Friend agree that this latest inconsistency, along with the eastern leg of HS2, Northern Powerhouse Rail, no rise in national insurance, no border down the Irish sea, ovenready deals and the 0"

4416," Members on both sides of the House to consider those principles when they make their decision on which Division Lobby to walk through later this afternoon, because those values must underpin all that we do in this House and on behalf of our constituents outside this House"
4417,"On that point about the UKs being a corrupt country and standards in public life, in 2006 we knew that peerages for £1 million were finding Labour party people going to the House of Lords"
4418, The coincidence is that now Tories with £3 million get into the House of Lords
4419, Lord Oakeshott of the Liberals said in 2014 that he bemoaned the fact that he had not ended the practice when he left
4420," Lady think that all party leaders of those parties that are putting people into the House of Lords should cap the donation level at £50,000, as suggested in the amendment I tabled, so that there can be no more sniff or smell of corruption in the UK with cash for peerages continuing"
4421,"I beg to move an amendment, to leave out from House to the end of the Question and add acknowledges recent concern over the outside interests of Members of Parliament; believes the rules which apply to MPs must be up to date, effective and appropriately rigorous; recalls the 2018 report by the Committee on Standards in Public Life into this matter; believes that recommendations 1 and 10 in that report form the basis of a viable approach which could command the confidence of parliamentarians and the public; believes that these recommendations should be taken forward; and supports crossparty work, including that being done by the Houses Committee on Standards, to bring forward recommendations to update the Code of Conduct for MPs by 31 January 2022"
4422," We come here fully aware of the fundamental principle that lies at the heart of our parliamentary democracy first and  foremost, we work on behalf of our constituents"
4423," As Edmund Burke said in his address to the electors of Bristol in 1774, familiar territory to the hon"
4424," Lady raises an interesting constitutional question, because misleading this House would arguably be a breach of the privileges of this House, and to take that to a court would be a breach of article 9 of the Bill of Rights"
4425, The Prime Minister made clear the Governments view that the MPs code of conduct should be updated as a matter of urgency to reflect two key recommendations made by the Committee on Standards in Public Life in its 2018 report on MPs outside interests
4426," It is an appalling abuse, a corrupt House, and we should be looking at abolishing it, not putting more people in because they happen to give the Tory party £3 million"
4427," Friend agree that it is easy to get rid of the stench of corruption, or perceived corruption even, of cash for honours the three party leaders who appoint to the House of Lords could simply say that they will not put in the Lords those who have donated over a certain sum of money over a certain period of timeperhaps £50,000 over five years"
4428,Have the last 18 people  who have given £3 million to the Conservative party found their way into the House of Lords or not Is that unsubstantiated

4440," Yes, I am not, so if the Leader of the House wants to intervene and correct me, I am happy to let him, because unfortunately I have never managed millions of pounds"
4441," Coming back to the recommendations from the 2018 report by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, while the Leader of the House blames the House for not having implemented them more quickly, it is his own failure, because he controls our time"
4442," We heard earlier about the House of Lords, and rightly sothat if you donate £3 million to the Conservative party, you will get yourself a seat in our legislature"

4446," My wife reminded me that I abandoned her and her safetya lifelong Labour activist, my wifeto three Tory MPs getting stuck in a lift, including Basildon Man, as she said, because he was still etched on our 1992 election memory"
4447," To give just one example, most recently he took the lead on a cause that I then took up the injustice done to young, unmarried mothers whose babies were taken from them in the 1960s and 1970s"
4448," When I first came into this place in 1992, he was outstandingly and unfailingly kind, conscientious and generous, even to new Members who had arrived here eight years after him"
4449," We were both elected to Parliament for the first time in 1983 with small majorities, became firm friends during the 1980s, and shared an office until 1987 in Abbey Gardens"
4450," He was a great parliamentarian, a great politician, a fantastic advocate on behalf of his constituents, and a great champion of our nation"
4451,"If you had told me before I was elected in 2015, Madam Deputy Speaker, that just a few years later I would be sitting at home grieving over the death of a Thatcherite Tory MP, I would not have believed you, but my partner Nadia and I did just that, for it was David who had died"
4452," It is right that I, as the chairman of the 1922 Committee, should pay tribute to David, who was a dedicated and effective BackBench Member of Parliament, but I also want to say a few  words today because I had the privilege of his friendship for the past 24 years"
4453," My mother Elizabeth was his association chairman and, at times, his election agent in Basildon before, during and after the 1983 election"
4454, He was of course the MP for Basildon as well as for Southend; he represented Basildon from 1983 to 1987
4455," He was seated just behind me and his face beamed with delight when I recalled that, as a teenager, I had been the Young Conservatives representative on the committee that selected him to become the prospective Conservative candidate for Basildon in 1983"
4456, I speak on behalf of all the 2019 intake when I say how very sad we are to lose him
4457," I got to know David in 2017, when he reached out to me with his characteristic kindness"
4458," As council leader from 1990, I pressed the Conservative Government to bring the channel tunnel rail link through a station  in Stratford"
4459," Singlehandedly, he made the campaign crossparty, and that was crucial to its success, leading to London 2012 and the regeneration that is under way at the moment"
4460," We all remembered David dashing our 1992 general election hopes by holding Basildon, but we invited him to our town hall celebration when the Stratford campaign succeeded"
4461, We hit it off from day 1
4462, I remember the day after the appalling Grand Hotel bombing in Brighton in 1984
4463," The emotion is the same across the House, but I remember just how acutely Jos loss was felt on these Benches, so today, on behalf of the entire Labour party, I want to lean across, to reach across and to acknowledge the pain that is felt on the opposite Benches, and I do"

4466, For him the glass was never half empty; it was three quarters full
4467," When introducing me, he would always make up a story I was the Strictly Come Dancing winner at his annual party for people over the age of 100; before there was a raffle, he would describe me as a lottery millionaire at a charity fundraiser; and there was my favourite ice breaker, which was, Meet James, he is my neighbour"

4472," His beaming face in 1992, when his victory marked a fourth election victory for the Conservatives, is of course iconic"
4473," However, I should say to the House that his biggest pride was not actually that result, but the one in 1983, when he won Basildon for the first timea victory as much against the odds as the one in 1992"
4474," He would recount with great pride the occasion when, after everyone had written off his election prospects in 1992, it was Margaret Thatcher who came on the eve of the poll to support him, and he credited part of his victory to that"
4475, Friend the Member for Derbyshire Dales Miss Dines and her dancing back in those days in 1983he was hugely proud that she got here toobut that the exact wedding he had to Julia in 1983 at Westminster cathedral and then a reception here was what he repeated for his daughter only a few weeks ago

4480," I also join her in paying tribute to the work that David did for all of us to improve our hospitals across mid and south Essex, a legacy that will continue to benefit hundreds of thousands of Essex residents"
4481,10 Paragraphs 2 to 6 of Standing Order No
4482,With this it will be convenient to consider clauses 2 to 4
4483," Threats that are emanating from other quarters about pulling out of the TCA and the like would, of course, do the exact opposite"
4484," In the Lords, the Government estimated that the total value of those contracts was about £300 trillion, so even if a tiny percentage of them do not transition over, they could still represent a significant amount of money"
4485," Does the Minister have any indication of the number and value of contracts that he thinks will still need to be covered by this Billnot as a percentage, but in actual pounds value"
4486," For example, a simple loan contract may say that the interest payable is LIBOR plus 2%"
4487," In this example, LIBOR represents the cost to the lender of getting access to the money to lend it out, and the 2% represents the additional risk to the lender associated with making the loan"
4488," Following the subsequent Wheatley review, LIBOR came under the regulatory jurisdiction of the FCA in 2013"
4489," However, in 2014 the G20s Financial Stability Board, known as the FSBnot to be confused with the Federation of Small Businessesdeclared that the continued use of such rates, including LIBOR, represented a potentially serious source of systemic risk"
4490," For example, it is estimated that 97% of all sterling LIBOR referencing derivatives will have transitioned by the end of the year"
4491, Clause 1 provides explicitly that LIBOR referencing contracts can rely on synthetic LIBOR
4492," The Bill forms part of a significant programme of work by the Government and regulators to support the global marketled transition away from LIBOR, as indicated by the FSB decision in 2014"
4493," Some estimates say it could be 200,000, or 1"
4494,"8% of the mortgages held in the UK, about half of which would be buytolet mortgages and the other half residential mortgages"
4495," It means just over onetenth of 1%, as there are 100 basis points in 1%"
4496, I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed that that is the correct interpretation of proposed new article 23FA6
4497," To make this matter even more complex, proposed new article 23FA7 in clause 1 leaves open the possibility of legal action, as long as the basis for it is not action taken under clause 1 of this Billthat is, it is not simply the move from LIBOR to another benchmark authorised by the FCA"
4498," It insulates from legal action the administrators of benchmarks, who in this case will work on behalf of the FCA, who, in turn, will work on behalf from Parliament, assuming that the Bill is passed"
4499, The shadow Minister mentioned that about £450 billionworth is likely to end up being covered by the Bill; my quick guess at the arithmetic is that that will mean less than 0
4500," However, that is the danger of referring to percentages we could say that 99"
4501,"8% of contracts will successfully transition, but that still leaves £450 billionworth that will not"
4502," If the worst happens and any of those mortgage borrowers get into serious difficulty, it  will be no comfort to them whatever to be told that 11 million other people are blissfully unaware of the problem"
4503," To someone with a mortgage that goes bad, the badness rate for mortgages is 100%"
4504," I have not tabled any amendments, but I will agree to the unamended Bill with my fingers crossed, because I fear that only time will tell whether it is 100% watertight"
4505," In the sometimes murky environment in which the Bill will operate, anything less than 100% will not be enough"
4506," Member for Glenrothes cited the figure of £472 billion, which was the FCAs estimate on 29 September"
4507, The clunky levers of the bureaucracy still manufactured a £10 million shortfall that was desperately required
4508," It was desperately required because, over the past 18 months, the British Council has been unable to be proactive in commercialising its operationits teaching of the English languagesimply because the pandemic closed down its major markets in the far east, but still there was a £10 million shortfall, and still to this day, they are in the process of closing 20 country operations at a time when we are espousing the principles of global Britain"
4509, More than 90% of its teaching and exam centres were shut at the height of the pandemic
4510, Since the start of the pandemic we have allocated more than £600 million to ensure that the British Council can continue to deliver on our priorities during this uniquely challenging time
4511," I hear what he says about the figures, and one does not dispute the moneys put into the British Council as its commercial activities collapsed, but the Government were still £10 million short of what was required to keep those 20 country operations fully operational, and that was the crime there"
4512," When one spoke with Ministers, there was no problem at allthey got itbut it still translated into a £10 million cut"
4513,"I am grateful to the Minister and have a few questions for him, all of which relate to clause 1"
4514," The small percentage of people who have mortgages covered by this legislationalthough it could potentially be quite a big number of peopleare now, through no fault of their own, quite literally staking their home on our getting this right"
4515, Are administrators adequately covered against being sued simply because they have published a figure that says the current synthetic LIBOR rate is 1
4516,2% rather than 1
4517,25% Are there grounds on  which they might be sued because those 0
4518,05 percentage points of difference in the published synthetic LIBOR rate either make or lose quite a lot of money
4519," For example, if we look at the threemonth LIBOR on GBP, we see that it has varied from 0"
4520,28% in September 2017 to 0
4521,"92% at the end of December 2019, and it is now 0"
4522,11%
4523," Since the 1930s, it has been promoting British culture and the English language abroad, as well as facilitating cultural exchanges and, crucially, building trust between the UK and other countries"
4524," In normal times, it receives only 15% of its income from the state, whereas many of its international counterparts receive much more"
4525," For example, its French, German and Japanese equivalents receive 48%, 62% and 65% respectively"
4526," This idea stems from discussion between the British Council and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office on cutting the British Councils funding allocation still further over the coming threeyear spending review period, despite the FCDOs budget increasing by 21% over the same threeyear timeframe"
4527,"Given that almost 100% of the rollon rolloff lorry traffic from  the EU to the Republic of Ireland goes through Great Britaina lot of it past Kettering on the A14 would not a sensible negotiated agreement towards a comprehensive and durable settlement involve Her Majestys Government taking responsibility for the policing of goods that go across the Irish sea to the Republic, in return for the free passage of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland if those goods are to stay in Northern Ireland"
4528,8 a Any Message from the Lords on the Bill may be considered forthwith without any Question being put; and any proceedings interrupted for that purpose shall be suspended accordingly
4529, 83G Programme orders conclusion of proceedings on further messages from the Lords apply for the purposes of bringing any proceedings to a conclusion in accordance with paragraph 8 of this Order
4530," Member for Glenrothes Peter Grant, where the question was asked how much are we talking about here In the debates in the other place on the Bill, the figure of about £450 billion was, I believe, mentioned as the worth of such outstanding contracts"
4531,"Forgive me for intervening yet again, but, for the normal person, does synthetic LIBOR and 12 basis points mean a 12% increase on what he or she might pay"
4532, We continue to work closely with the British Council on the implications of the 2022 to 2025 spending review
4533, Paragraph 7 therefore ensures that article 23FA does not extinguish existing causes of action
4534," The clause, as with clause 1, deals with the circumstance where the FCA has designated a benchmark as an article 23A benchmark"
4535," Clause 3 ensures that the Bills provisions apply to all references to the benchmark in question in contracts and arrangements under UK law, including those outside the scope of the benchmarks regulation"
4536," Finally, clause 4 provides for the Bills territorial extent and specifies that it will come into force on the day on which it is passed, to give the market the certainty that it needs by the end of the calendar year"
4537, I therefore recommend that clauses 1 to 4 stand part of the Bill
4538," That is why we need, first, Northern Powerhouse Rail in full, because we need additional capacity, and secondly, £3 billion for a full mass transit system for West Yorkshire to be not just promised but delivered into the coffers of the West Yorkshire Combined Authority"
4539," Its programmes reach 790 million people in more than 100 countries every year, and it plays a vital role in enhancing our standing in the world"
4540," When the council is involved in cultural and educational exchanges, trust in the UK increases by 16% on average"
4541," By 2025, it plans to reach 140 million English language learners and attract 600,000 international students here to the UK"
4542," It also hopes to connect to 30 million people with UK arts and culture, either in person or remotelyfor example, by visiting our worldbeating film and arts festivals in cinemas and galleries, or indeed online"
4543," and learned Friend make of the fact that 20% of the European Unions checks still occur in relation to goods going from GB to NI, despite Northern Ireland having the equivalent of 0"
4544,"5% of the European Unions population Does he agree that the bad faith the European Union is exercising in this matter makes it absolutely essential that we continue to keep under consideration the rescinding of articles 5, 7, 8 and 10, as outlined by the July Command Paper"
4545," There are 200 level 1 and level 2 applicants for the Afghan relocations and assistance policy scheme, and the paperwork is simply not being produced"
4546, A recent Queens University survey found that 52% of people in Northern Ireland support the protocol; I am sure the Minister will agree that that is a significant figure
4547,5% of the EUs as a whole
4548," Facebook has since banned companies from targeting ads based on users political beliefs, sexual orientation or religion, but these decisions should not be left to tech billionaires who could change their mood at any time"
4549, I am shocked and appalled that it has taken until today for a Minister to come to the House to do Members the courtesy of answering questions on behalf of the Government
4550," Is the Paymaster General concerned that after the chiding the Government got for putting in place a protocol that has put a border down the Irish sea, we now appear to have a Joan of Arclike standoff, with the Opposition holding to the protocol as if it were something precious when it is destroying business and costing businesses in Northern Ireland £850 million That is what is catastrophic the friction of trade within the United Kingdom"
4551," He referred to MS, which has indicated this week that extra costs and extra bureaucracy on products crossing the border will cost it £9 million"
4552,"No one disputes the success that some of these measures have had but there is a strong resentmentwhich, I have to say, I sharein many quarters about giving any Government extension to powers that are quite as blank as these are"
4553," Have the Government considered any other mechanism for allowing extension for a lesser amount of time or are there alternatives by using the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, which many of us feel should have been used from the outset, rather than presenting this giftwrapped to the devolved parts of the United Kingdom"
4554," What I can say, which I certainly hope will reassure him, is that the Act will be regularly reviewed, that parliamentary scrutiny from all quarters is very welcome and that any powers retained in the Act need to be properly justifiedthey must be necessary and proportionate"
4555, That is the case that I am setting out on behalf of the Government today
4556,"There is a limited amount of time for this debate, which needs to finish at 4"
4557," It is for that reason that if there were a Division I would not be voting for this legislation, because I do not think it comes with enough parliamentary scrutinythe sort of scrutiny that there is if we use the Civil Contingencies Act 2004"
4558," We have given nearly 95 million vaccines, with more than eight in 10 of every man, woman and child in the UK over the age of 12 getting at least one jab and some 79% receiving at least two"
4559," The latest estimates show that our vaccines have prevented over 24 million infections, over 260,000 hospitalisations and over 127,000 deaths"
4560, Friend explain in detail which of the measures that the Government seek to retain could not be implemented alternatively by means of the Civil Contingencies Act or the Public Health Control of Disease Act 1984
4561," Yesterday, we recorded close to 50,000 infections, more than 7,000 people were in hospitalwith nearly 800 in ICUand every day on average 100 of our fellow citizens sadly die from this disease"
4562," In the past three weeks, we have seen an average of 10,000 new covid infections every day in schools and thousands are missing school as a consequence"
4563," The Secretary of State rightly referred to health disparities and stalling life expectancy in Blackpool, but his Government have presided over public health cuts of £43 per person per year across Blackpool, which are some of the largest in the country"
4564," As of Friday, only half of eligible over80s had received their booster jab"
4565," Charities including Blood Cancer UK and Kidney Care UK are warning that the thirddose programme for the immunosuppressed has been a chaotic failure, with between 55% and 60% yet to be invited to get a third dose, as of Friday"
4566," The 1984 Act remains in place and gives Ministers all the powers they would want to be able to lock down the country againI hope that is never needed, but they have the powers if they need them"
4567," Member for Twickenham Munira Wilson on vaccine passports, the Secretary of State gave half of the right answer, which was that the Government would have to persuade the House to introduce vaccine passports, and he confirmed that the House would have to vote on it"
4568, 1125
4569," Yesterday, that vaccine company which is developing the only inactivated covid19 vaccine in clinical development in Europe, and manufacturing that vaccine in Scotland, published positive data from its phase 3 clinical trial"
4570," We do not know how many will leave the NHS at that stage, but if vaccinations in the NHS stand at about 90%, we could be looking at a loss of more than 100,000 people"
4571, The shadow spokesman raised the issue of vaccinations and I am pleased to report that 3
4572,6 million booster jabs have been delivered to date over a very short time period
4573," The NHS longterm plan commits to increasing investment in mental health at least as fast as investment in physical health, with at least £2"
4574,"3 billion of extra spending on mental health by 202324, which I hope he welcomes"
4575,"Covid certification will be brought in under the Public Health Control of Disease Act 1984, which, as my right hon"
4576," As of yesterday, we have administered some 3"
4577,7 million jabs
4578," It has protected the NHS in its hour of need by allowing tens of thousands of medical and care staff to register with the NHS temporarily, including nurses, midwives, paramedics, radiographers, social workers and many others; by keeping public services going, including ensuring that our courts and local democracy could function; and by providing a vital lifeline for people and businesses across the country, supporting 11"
4579,7 million jobs and providing 1
4580,6 million business loans
4581," We need to keep working on it, but it might be helpful to know that under section 2 of the Act, the Nursing and Midwifery Council has been able to register temporarily some 14,000 nurses, midwives and nursing associates in England, and the Health and Care Professions Council has been able to register more than 21,000 temporary paramedics, operating department practitioners, radiographers and other professionals"
4582," They include section 51, which relates to potentially infectious persons and which has been used only 10 times and not since October 2020; section 52, which gave powers to issue directions relating to events, gatherings and premises, and which has never been used; section 23, which relates to time limits for urgent warrants under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 and which is no longer proportionate to this stage of the pandemic; and section 37, which allowed for the disruption of education for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities, and which continues to be unused"
4583, 8MC
4584," The point made at the time was that the Act is not necessary, because it replicates many other pieces of legislation, and that the Act alone allows the Government to act without recourse to the House, which is not true of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 or the Public Health Control of Disease Act 1984"
4585,"I think the problem for the Secretary of State is how the Government acted in the past by not bringing things to the House for debate; I know that the chairman of the 1922 committee, my hon"
4586," Taken together with the 13 out of 40 temporary nondevolved provisions in the Act that have already expired, that will mean that half of the original 40 temporary nondevolved powers in the Act will expire early"
4587," In line with our autumn and winter plan, we intend to retain the temporary provisions that remain essential to our ongoing pandemic work, including sections 2, 6, 14, 38, 45, 50 and 75, which cover vital aspects such as supporting the NHS to help it to retain emergency staff and enabling statutory sick pay to be provided for people who are selfisolating"
4588, 2 Bill

4602," It was also felt that, should the 10% signing threshold be reached and a byelection campaign be subsequently triggered, the risk to the complainants confidentiality would become greater"

4604," The Recall of MPs Act 2015 provides three conditions for a recall petition process, one of which is a suspension of a period of at least 10 sitting days or 14 calendar days"

4617," The biggest risk is that the British Government give that the same lack of attention and preparation they gave to Afghanistan in the 18 months ahead of the NATO withdrawal, so why on earth is the Prime Minister now cutting back, by more than half, on his National Security Council meetings"
4618," Secondly, he should not rule out the fact that counterterrorism funding both for here and abroad has increased significantly since 2015, with well over 30% of funding both to civilians such as the police and the intelligence services and to special forces and the armed forces"

4650," James and I share a birth year, 1968I like to think it was a very fine vintage indeed"
4651," As we speak today, the Roy Castle Lung Foundation will already be richer to the tune of more than £50,000 because of the tribute page that has been set up in Jamess memory by Cathy and the family"

4667, He was indeed a man who had genuine qualities that were reflected in the way in which he took decisions on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland

4679," This is an unacceptable level of service that has let down the thousands of members of the armed forces and veterans, and on behalf of the Ministry of Defence I apologise"
4680," Of the 311, there are 260 principals left in Afghanistanthat is 1,232 people if we include their families43 principals, or 163 pax in total, in third countries, and eight with whom we have still not been able to establish communications despite trying numerous times"
4681," First, the investigation will be carried out by Admiral Sir Ben Key, the commander of joint operations at PJHQpermanent joint headquarterswho also led the planning and the evacuation from Kabul"
4682," It is my view that we should continue to stand by them, including using married quarters, for example, in military establishments to look after them if they cannot get places elsewhere"
4683," Does the Secretary of State agree that his Department has a systemic problem with data security What steps will he take to fix the issues and ensure the safety of the thousands still waiting to be evacuated What assurances can he give to the families in my Liverpool, Riverside constituency who are very concerned about the safety of their loved ones who are still waiting to be evacuated"
4684, I think that to give a 100% assurance would be misleading

4688," In annexing Crimea in 2014, igniting the flames of conflict in eastern Ukraine and threatening western democracies by, for instance, interfering in their elections, it has challenged the fundamental basis of international order"

4694, The attacks in Salisbury in March 2018 show that the lid may have been lifted but that the statesponsored terrorism continues to this very day
4695," They were overruled in 2014 by the High Court, which is how we end up today with the European Court of Human Rights ruling against Putins Russia on this killing"
4696," I support the work the Government have been doing on this, but may I ask her specifically about the review launched three years ago into the socalled golden visas, the tier 1 visas, to look at  oligarchs with close links to the Russian state who might be using criminal money and others We have not heard any update on that review, so will she update the House now on what work is being done"

4699," Post the appalling Salisbury incident in 2018, we saw the work led by our then Prime Minister, my right hon"
4700,"I think that the lesson learned is that this was an evacuation in the 21st century in which emails, WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook were a running commentary, but the inboxes of serving officers and soldiers in Kabul on the operation were also filling up with emails from former colleagues in the hundreds, saying Can you get X and Y out It would not have happened in my day, because we did not have that type of network"

4707," What assessment has the Secretary of State made of how many interpretersnot families, but interpretersthe MOD has been able to rescue from Afghanistan It jars slightly with numbers in the low hundreds that he is presenting to the House today"
4708," She is right to point to the whole area of the tier 1 investor visa route, which, historically, as the whole House is well aware, has led to a range of the wider issues we have just been speaking aboutinvestments, illicit finance, corruption and a lack of transparency"
4709," Does she agree that the four actions called for by the Royal Osteoporosis Society in its manifesto for a future without osteoporosis, including an expansion of the fracture liaison services, are not too much to ask for the 3"
4710,5 million people affected by the curse of osteoporosis
4711,"Just to talk through the timings, the windups will start no later than 4"
4712," The purpose of the Secretary of States press conference was to appeal directly to the public to come forward for their vaccines, including the 4"
4713,7 million people over the age of 18 in England who have not accepted the vaccine
4714," In fact, at the start of the week 5"
4715,"4 million people were eligible for their booster jabs, and 4 million people had taken up that opportunity 4 million arms had been jabbed"
4716, It is also important to ensure that the 4
4717,"7 million people who have not yet taken up the offer of the first jab are encouraged to come forward, because, as the right hon"
4718, That is why I am calling on the 4
4719,"7 million people who have yet to come forward for their first jab and on others to have their booster jab as soon as they are eligible, as well as encouraging 12 to 15yearolds to get their jab as soon as they have the opportunity"
4720,"If the vaccination programme is, as the Minister rightly says, our best defence against covid, why are the Government so complacent about improving vaccination rates In Nottingham, despite the hard work of partners, less than half of under30s have had both doses of the covid vaccine"
4721,"When we are increasingly concerned about mental health, the mask the Minister was wearing only moments ago denies us the fellowship and reassurance of her friendly facial expression, but the material of which it is composed has gaps that are 5,000 times bigger than the virus, does it not"
4722, Since then the Government have gone very quiet about this new product and we have recently learned that the thousands of people who volunteered to take part in the Novavax trials are being given alternative vaccines to ensure that they are properly covered
4723, The Government have already ordered tens of millions of doses

4726," Member for Chichester Gillian Keegan, who received the report on behalf of the Government"
4727," In Wales, nearly half of all working women are over 50 and are likely to be experiencing the perimenopause or the menopause"
4728," Although the Equality Act 2010 prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sex, research from the Wales TUC, which has done great work on this for many years and I commend it to the Minister, highlights how many women feel that managers simply do not recognise problems associated with the menopause in the way that they would for other health conditions, even those with similar symptoms arising from different causes"
4729," In studies conducted ahead of the publication of its superb menopause toolkit, the Wales TUC found that almost a third of women with direct experience of the menopause felt that it was treated negatively in their workplace and nearly 60% reported witnessing the menopause being treated as a joke"
4730, That affects 3
4731,5 million people across the UK
4732," Although people living with the disease can live a healthy life with prompt diagnosis and the right support, millions are suffering the consequences of longterm pain and even disability because of underdiagnosis and undertreatment"
4733," Research from the Royal Osteoporosis Society shows that a quarter of osteoporosis sufferers will be living with longterm pain; that 71% have trouble with cleaning and cooking; and that 52% say the condition affects their ability to get around, to drive or to use public transport"
4734," I implore Ministers to work with the ROS on its request for the Government to matchfund their research investment, as part of a muchneeded rebalancing of research investment towards musculoskeletal conditions, which account for 9% of the health burden, but a mere 3% of the research spend"
4735," I first encountered the issue as a young woman writing a draft womens strategy for a regional health authority in 1989, in which it did not feature"
4736," Companies such as Channel 4, Asos, Vodafone, HSBC and many others mentioned today are doing tremendous work"
4737," The NHS workforce is 77% female, and it is working to develop a menopause workplace support package, which will be pioneered in the NHS through local health systems"
4738, 1 issue that they wanted the womens health strategy to cover
4739," I can guarantee that mums on a tight budget will make sure that their kids have everything they need before finding  the £20 to pay for the prescription, which means that that cost is a real barrier for many women up and down the country"
4740," Menopause training in medical schools is unacceptably poor, with 41% offering no mandatory menopause training at all"
4741, More than threequarters of menopausal women are now in employment
4742, Looking again at those responses and at the hundreds of emails coming into my inbox makes me realise just how many women out there are now ready to reach out and share their experiences
4743," Goodness, anywhere can be difficult, but a recent survey carried out by the Fawcett Society on behalf of Standard Chartered and the Financial Services Skills Commission, specifically about women in finance who are experiencing  the menopause, highlighted some really stark findings"
4744, Over 50% of women are worried about taking on additional responsibilities because of the menopausethat is the promotion gone
4745, Let that sink in a million women
4746,"5tog duvet, which could explain it"
4747," Indeed, as colleagues have said, we now know that around one in 100 women in the UK will experience menopausal symptoms before they turn 40, and it is estimated that in total around 13 million women in the UK are currently perimenopausal or menopausal"
4748, It does not take a genius to work out that it will affect about half of us in our lifetimes
4749," There is still far too much mystery around our bodies, despite making up 51% of the population, and that simply has to change"
4750," I need to get to it, pick up the statement that has been given to me by the Government, read it, write what I am going to say, make sure that it is only half the length of the statement and then come back"
4751, A postmenopausal woman has a 50% chance of sustaining an osteoporosisrelated fracture in her lifetime
4752, of women suffer from menopausal symptoms; 100% of women deserve support
4753, We must bear it in mind that the UK was known for underutilising EU state ruleswe were ranked 22nd out of 28 member  states in 2018and it could be suggested that that was due to Conservative ideology rather than to any intrinsic problem
4754, One objection to lowering the threshold to a few hundred pounds rather than £0
4755,"5 million might be the burden  of red tape attached, but, as I understand it, the costs for having a database that includes pretty much every subsidyabout £20,000 per annumare minimal"
4756,"Since 2001, life chances for women and girls in Afghanistan have been dramatically improved, but with the Talibans return, that is obviously under severe threat"
4757," Transparency is also severely lacking in the case of some subsidies, putting the country at risk of allowing damaging subsidies on the scale of hundreds of thousands of pounds, and allowing the use of public money to continue unknown and therefore unchallenged"
4758," For example, in 2019 the UK spent just 0"
4759,"38% of GDP on state aid, far lower than Germany, which spent more than three times that or Hungary and Denmark"
4760," In the consultation on the Bill, the Government asked whether there should be a minimum threshold of £50,000 below which no subsidies would need to be reported, and 64% of those who responded agreed on that threshold of £50,000"
4761," The new Bill, as we have heard, has a variety of different exemptions, but broadly speaking it requires us to disclose subsidies of above £500,000"
4762," One of them is even higher still, at £725,000, for public interest subsidies of one kind or another, which I think is for subsidising things such as buses and social housing"
4763," Yet if we look at the facts before us, 95% of all state aid measures did not even go near the European Commissions desk, so we are almost fixing a problem that did not exist in the terms that the Government think it did, irrespective of how much they want to make Brussels seem like the bad guys"
4764," 1 reason for transparency is that, as my hon"
4765," I think the only objection that could be raised to a much lower limit would be creating red tape, but according to the research I have seen, there is a minimal amount of red tape and a minimal amount of costabout £20,000"
4766, Only 9% of EU funds spent in Wales made it as far as local authorities for decision making; the majority were decided on and spent from Cardiff bay
4767," England has its own problems and challenges in this area, but, by contrast, the figure in England was 36% four times as much money and decision making flowed out into the local authorities and the regions from Westminster"
4768," Other principles set out in part 2 of the Bill ensure that our internal market operates freely and without hindrance, avoiding the subsidy race that has already been referenced between different parts of the UK"
4769, Members that it will be at 7 oclock at the latest; it depends on how long the hon
4770," 1 priority, and we are supporting the police with more powers, resources and officers to carry out their critical work now and in the future"
4771," In the wake of such a terrible tragedy, we are fully committed to helping the local community, and I can inform the House that we have allocated over £1 million in additional Government funding to support the recovery effort in Keyham"
4772," Over £800,000 will be invested in community safety and policing to help rebuild confidence and reassure the public that Keyham is a safe place to live, work and go to school"
4773," Almost £300,000 will be made available to the Devon, Cornwall and Isles of Scilly police and crime commissioner to commission additional support services as required"
4774," They also targeted the wider road networknamely, the M1, M3 and M11"
4775," Yesterday, protesters blocked both M25 carriageways between junction 9 and junction 10"
4776," Delays caused by protests between 13 and 17 September have cost drivers in excess of £500,000"
4777," Previous actions of Extinction Rebellion, of which I understand Insulate Britain is an offshoot, have cost the taxpayer £50 million and diverted valuable police resources"
4778," In less than 100 days, COP26 will be over and our chance to keep the planets warming below 1"
4779,5 will have been either grasped or abandoned
4780," Unfortunately, however, the penalty that attaches to that offence is quite weakit is a level 3 fine, which is up to £1,000"
4781," Although in any one day the police will do thousands of things that go well and something that then appears on social media may indicate otherwise, we need to be careful about drawing wider lessons of police treatment of people from that"
4782," Friend, I ask whether he will take every step necessary if those people turn up on the M6, M5 or wherever else and urge the police to take every action necessary to remove them immediately from the public highway, otherwise somebody will get killed"
4784," It is a multimillionpound ask, and I am sure it is a difficult one to receive as a Minister halfway through a budget year, but it is important that we take time to look at what a difference it would make"
4785," I live half a mile from the shooting, and this is my community"
4786," I was delighted to have my third jab this morning, and I would urge all colleagues to make the case for the vaccine rollout, which is important for everyone but particularly for those with protected characteristics and those of us who are in the 1% who were shielded throughout the pandemic"
4787," Of course, the kickstart scheme also has more than £2 billion of funding"
4788,On Thursday 12 August at about 6
4789,"The Taliban, who banned women from playing all sport during their rule in the 1990s, have indicated that women and girls will face restrictions in playing sport, which has caused the countrys womens football team to flee to Pakistan"
4790," At some point, a future Secretary of State could end up with quite a controlling regime by defining particular interest as any subsidy of more than half a million pounds, and then we would be back where we were"
4791," Friend was saying earlier a regime in which we have to wait six months for a disclosure, and then only of amounts over half a  million pounds, has the wrong balance"
4792," It is not a halfhour, quick and dirty process; there is plenty of time to gather the information that is needed to declare the subsidy, which can then, pretty promptly, be put on to what I suspect will be a simple database form that the CMA, or whoever, will put in place"
4793," We have published the names, in a range of bands starting with £1 to £10,000, of employers who have received that subsidy during the pandemic"
4794," I think that if we can publicise the details of employers who have received up to £10,000, we can justify publishing the name of anyone who has received a subsidy that has gone through a due process, down to a much lower level than £500,000, without its being unduly damaging to their commercial confidential interests"
4795,"I am sure the Minister was as shocked as the rest of us to discover that the increase in young black unemployment was exponentially higher than the increase in young white unemployment at the end of the last quarter of last year, and it has not got better"
4796," There is no reason why we should worry about disclosing pretty much any subsidy, particularly because local councils, for example, already have to report anything they spend above £500"
4797," They already take records, keep notes, and publish those details, and it would be peculiar to say that although they have to declare spending above £500, they do not have to declare subsidies above £500,000"
4798," May I ask the Minister to look at the M1 and the A1, which take people north and are crucial to the lifeblood of the country If we do not keep the traffic moving, we will affect the economy"
4799," Life expectancy increased from 56 years in 2002 to 64 in 2018, and over the past six years the UK has helped more than 250,000 girls to attend school through the girls education challenge fund"
4800," The Tories have quite happily dished out billions of pounds worth of contracts to their donors and friends for wasted personal protective equipment throughout the pandemic, but I guess that in real terms, transparency comes and goes depending on"
4801," In part 5, an interested party is defined in clause 707 as the Secretary of State while others are just people who may be affected"
4802, So we will still have a situation  where energy from the EU is allowed to come into the UKthe companies are not paying any charges for using our networkyet people who have wind farms in Scotland are paying £5
4803, And those in Wales are being paid £2
4804," It will empower hundreds of local authorities, as well as the devolved Administrations and other public authorities, to take control, allowing them to design subsidies to meet local needs while also meeting national policy objectives"
4805," Friend agree that, in fact, the Bill does the opposite of levelling up, in that it refuses to allow anything to happen in disadvantaged areas that will disadvantage rich areas That is how the Bill is writtenit is in schedule 1F"
4806," I also thank the Wolseley Trust for its coordinating and fundraising for the Plymouth together fund, which has already raised thousands for the funerals, the victims and the community, but more is needed"
4807," Gentleman will know, the Government are investing significant amounts of moneymore than £1 billion this year aloneon encouraging people to take green measures in their own homes, to help us with the fight against climate change"
4808,"Along with millions of people up and down the country, I welcome the move taken by my right hon"
4809," StokeonTrent has welcomed nearly £1 million of Government funding earlier this year as part of the green homes grant scheme, which is being distributed to the citys most vulnerable"
4810, 1057
4811," Now that we have left, £182 million is due to be returned to the UK"
4812, Friend has been an impressive and focused campaigner on behalf of her constituents and the wider industry
4813, That is part of how we can ensure resilience in our economythe need for which has been highlighted only too starkly by the gasprice challenge and the CO2 challenge of the past week
4814," That is because one of the other exemptions, which I think is £325,000, is for a cumulative set of subsidies"
4815," If I have three or four subsidies granted by three or four different local councils, or perhaps by a devolved Government and some local councils, and they cumulatively add up to £325,000 over a threeyear period, that has to be declared and everyone has to keep track of that"
4816," We welcome the fact that the Bill has been introduced, that there is a proposal to replace the EU subsidy regime and that the Government are making provision for it, but I put it to the Government that what is in the Bill is really only half of what we need if we are to have an effective and adequate UK subsidy regime"
4817," Any subsidy regime that is not accompanied by a clear industrial strategy is really only half the picture, because we just do not know where the public support might best be directed"
4818," In fact, the only such definition is in clause 8, which refers to businesses and enterprises"
4819," One of the principles outlined in schedule 1 is that subsidies should be proportionatethere is no fixed percentage; it is simply that they be proportionatebut under the EEAEU state aid regime, subsidies cannot be more than 50%"
4820," For example, if a subsidy is made available to a firm in Scotland that could equally be looking at Northern Ireland, Scotland would have the advantage of saying that it is so important to Scotland and fits in with its objectives that it will give it a subsidy equal to 70%that may even be accepted under the control regime in the rest of the United Kingdom"
4821," However, Northern Ireland would be excluded from seeking to attract that firm on the basis that the EU state aid rules say it cannot go over 50%"
4822," Currently,  around half of all older adults in care receive some state support for their care costs"
4823, This clause would also make a number of minor technical amendments to other sections of the Care Act 2014
4824," Friend back to my previous point when compared to the current system, this is a significant improvement and step forward, particularly when taken in the round with the overall package of measures that see the floors go from £23,250 up to £100,000 and from £14,250 up to £20,000"
4825," We are capping the amount that anyone will be forced to spend on personal care costs in their lifetime at £86,000"
4826,"On the point the Minister is making about the Dilnot proposals and a comparison, let me tell him that the Alzheimers Society said that 15% of people with dementia in the northwest would reach the cap under the Governments proposals, compared with 34% under Dilnots proposals"
4827," That is a massive amount, and those are the people, with their families, who are paying hundreds of thousands and pounds"
4828," First, minor and technical Government amendment 29 will update a reference in the Health and Social Care Community Health and Standards Act 2003 to reflect the changes made to section 99 of the National Health Service Act 2006"
4829," Secondly, Government amendment 30 will designate integrated care boards as operators of essential services under the Network and Information Systems Regulations 2018"
4830," Member for Thirsk and Malton Kevin Hollinrakethat everybody would be better off under new clause 49 than they are now Is it not the case, as illustrated by the Health Foundation, that people with very modest homes, worth less than £106,000, will never hit the cap and therefore will not be better off under the Governments proposed system than they are now"
4831," We could spend all our time referring to what we said 10 years ago, and how the Health and Social Care Act 2012 has proved to be the disaster that we said it would be, but we will spare the Government the We told you so lectures, because even those on the Government Benches are now aware that the 2012 Act has been among the worst policy mistakes in the history of the NHS"
4832," We were originally told that this was a Bill for integration, but halfway through its consideration, we were told there would be a White Paper along shortly to deal with integration"
4833, We have seen the NHS proposals for a provider selection regime to replace the regulations under section 75 of the 2012 Act
4834," I gave the example earlier that in our region, 15% of people with dementia will reach the cap, whereas 34% would have under the Dilnot proposals"
4835," I think that what we will end up with after this measure will be a whole lot better for people on low incomes than what we had, because the meanstest threshold will be raised from £23,000 to £100,000, and that is a very significant improvement"
4836," As has been highlighted in the media and by Members in the Chamber, those with assets of about £100,000 will not see any real gain from this policy, while those sitting on assets of £500,000 or more will keep a lot of their wealth"
4837, That has been provided free in Scotland both within the care home and in home care since 2002
4838," It was expanded in 2011 to provide more hours so that people with greater need could stay at home longer, and it was extended to those under 65 with care needs in April 2019"
4839," It is an investment that we spend 43% more per head on social care in Scotland, but it is an investment in peoples independence and their inclusion in society"
4840," of adults between 16 and 74 experience such abuse, and the Home Office has determined that the cost of that was £66 billion in 201617"
4841," Of that, £2"
4842,3 billion was the cost to the health service
4843," We know that 23% of those who are at risk attend AE, and yet nothing happens"
4844," The estimate from the pilot so far reckons that if we spent £450,000 a year on our GPs in Devon, we would get a return of £7 million"
4845," Does she agree that to find patients for studies, often tens of thousands of pounds is spent on radio and online adverts If her amendment 17 is successful, it could be revolutionary for research in this country"
4846," That is why I have put forward amendment 58, which is designed to ensure that any organisation carrying out the functions of an ICB on its behalf is a statutory NHS body"
4847, Friend agree that the Bill has the sense of being an NHS corporate takeover Bill We have already seen £5 billion in contracts being awarded to private companies through the VIP lane
4848," The purpose of the ICSs is to have a more preventive, more flexible and less siloed approach than we have under the current clinical commissioning groups, without removing the grit in the oyster that is the purchaserprovider split and without upsetting the 1948 settlement involving local authorities doing social care and having a national NHS"
4849,My amendments 1 and 2 primarily relate to selfcare
4850," We know the numbers 100,000 vacancies in the NHS and more than 120,000 in social care; and 1"
4851,5 million people missing out on the care they need
4852, Major AEs treated more than 1
4853,4 million people in Octoberthe third highest monthly figure on record
4854," The Government should delay the Bill for a few months and look properly at reforming social care, rather than doing a halfbaked job now"
4855, He can say that with some force because of the more than £5 billion extra being put forward by the Government to fund social care in a sustainable way for the future
4856, We now have more than 5
4857,7 million people on NHS waiting lists
4858," After the Government won the 2010 election, around 500,000 to 750,000 people were on NHS waiting lists, and the number rose every year before the pandemic, so the waiting lists are the longterm effect of the Conservative policies of underfunding and privatisation"
4859," Among people younger than 65, the covid19 mortality rate was almost four times higher for the 10% living in the mostdeprived areas than for those living in the leastdeprived areas"
4860,"I caught your eye half a minute ago, Madam Deputy Speaker, and you indicated to me with that look that I was next"
4861," Over the next few years, we need to recruit 9,000 more mental health nurses to   look after our constituents and more than 800 new psychiatrists, and we need to give all organisations charged with delivering healthcare that nudge, that push, that call to arms that they need to make these important things happen"
4862, The billions squandered on test and trace should serve as a warning of what the Government could do to the whole of our NHS
4863, Such tendering to the private sector was made a requirement under section 75 of the coalition Governments Health and Social Care Act 2012
4864," I will be voting against the whole Bill, but if the Government refuse to accept amendment 9 to make the NHS the default provider, that shows what the Government of the party that objected to the foundation of the NHS in the first place are really up to, despite all the warm words"
4865," NHS England research indicates that the outcomes for most major conditions are significantly better than they were 10 years ago, and the NHS is seeing more patients and delivering more tests, treatments and operations than at any time in its 73year historymillions more than 10 years ago when the Conservatives returned to power"
4866," The London School of Economics has assessed that perinatal depression, anxiety and psychosis carry a total longterm cost to society of about £8"
4867,1 billion for each oneyear cohort of births in the UK
4868, Analysis by the WAVE Trust indicates that up to 30% of domestic violence begins during pregnancy
4869,4 billion over the next three years
4870, That funding will end wholly unpredictable care costs and include at least £500 million to support the adult social care workforce
4871," It will be implemented using legislation already in place under the 2014 Care Act, which introduces the independent Dilnot Commissions social care charging reform"
4872,"Amendments made 31, page 222, leave out lines 9 to 11"
4873," We are increasing the upper capital limit from £23,250 to £100,000, which will make masses of people with moderate assets eligible for some state support towards the cost of care earlier, and the lower capital limit will also increase, from £14,250 to £20,000"
4874," Below that level, people will contribute only from their income, fully protecting their savings and assets below £20,000"
4875," According to the Health Foundation, assuming care costs of about £500 a week, those with assets of £150,000 will take a year and a half longer to reach the cap than they would have under the Dilnot proposals, those with assets of £125,000 will take four and a half  years longer, and those with assets of under £106,000 will never reach the care cap"
4876," Contrary to what the Minister has said, people with assets of £106,000 or less will not benefit from the proposal at all"
4877," Ordinary people on modest incomes will pay an extra tax that will not stop them having to sell their home to pay for their care costs, but that will mean the mansiondwelling millionaires can keep theirs"
4878," People on lower incomes will pay into a system that they will see little benefit from, but that will protect 90% of a property worth £1 million"
4879," Members need help translating that into what it means for their constituents, I have a selection of median house prices in various constituencies across the country in Hartlepool, the median house price is £128,000; in Bishop Auckland, it is £125,000; in Blackpool South, it is £114,000; in StokeonTrent Central, it is £112,000; in Hyndburn, it is £110,000; and in Burnley, it is £99,000"
4880," A richer council that pays more costs than the statutory minimum as set out in the Care Act 2014 would help local residents to meet the cap sooner than a poorer council that pays only the statutory minimum of care costs, and therefore people who live in poorer areas would take longer to reach the cap, so we would end up, in effect, with a postcode lottery cap meaning that people from poorer areas would tend to have to contribute more"
4881,"This part of the package was described in September, because it was made clear in September that the £86,000 cap was a cap on individual costs"
4882, It did not say then that that included the costs that local government may make on someones behalf
4883," The reforms increase the threshold above which people must meet the full cost of their care from £23,000 to £100,000more than four times the limit"
4884," The daily living costs limit of £200 per week means that more people will keep more of their income and assets and the package includes domiciliary care, which many others have not done"
4885," The first is how we support workingage adults, who make up more than half of those who need adult social care"
4886," It did not end where our fragile planet demanded, but, with 1"
4887,"5 now in critical care, it failed to grasp the scale of the crisis and it fell short of the demands required to safeguard against our planet burning, melting, flooding and people dying"
4888," In its first phase, it will deliver 4,000 goodquality green collar jobs engineers, biologists, agronomists, food technologists, chemists, natural capital economists, and robotic and digital expertsjobs so needed in the region"
4889,4 billion gross value added within the Yorkshire region alone
4890," As for our planet, in the UK, 2"
4891,8 million tonnes of carbon will disappear in emissions annually and landfill waste will be cut by 1
4892,"2 million tonnes, growing as technology is scaled"
4893, The price of this phase is just £171 million
4894, The central economic forecast is that BioYorkshire will deliver a return on Government investment of 8
4895,3 to 1
4896," That means that the UK, in an increasingly competitive global world, has to continue to punch above its weight in science with worldclass science and science for the global good that helps to prevent climate change, feed 9 billion hungry mouths and solve global challenges, as the hon"
4897," We have decided to increase that again in the next three years by 30%, from £15 billion to £20 billion a year, and we have recommitted to move to £22 billion a year  by 27 on the journey to spending 2"
4898,4% of GDP
4899," We have to feed 9 billion mouths and double world food production with the same land area and half as much water and energy, which is a big challenge"
4900," This was the taskforce on innovation, growth and regulatory reform reportor, Madam Deputy Speaker, the TIGRR report, if that trips off the tongue more easilyin which we identified 10 sectors where with very little regulatory leadership, and no need of primary legislation, we could unlock billions of investment"
4901,1 The Care Act 2014 is amended as follows
4902, Currently around half of all older adults in care receive some state support
4903," For those with assets of about £106,000, by my read of this graph, about 59% of their assets would be lost on average under the original proposals"
4904," Under the amended proposals, that figure would rise to 70%"
4905," He was born in the war, and they were given a council house by the Attlee Governmentmy dad could lecture us on it for weeks He was given a council house, which his very Conservative parents bought in the 1980s"
4906," She bought her council house in the 1980s, and that council house stands in my constituency"
4907," It is worth around £120,000"
4908," All through our lives we watched that area get a little bit trendier, and the price of my dads house, which he bought for £30,000, went up and up and up"
4909," His house is probably worth around £700,000 now, and it was £30,000 when he bought it"
4910," Yet today, the people who live in my constituency and the council house that my granny bought, to try to get a better life, will subsidise the care of my father, who has a £700,000 house that I do not need to inherit"
4911," As he quite rightly highlighted, we must look at the floors as well as the cap, at the support that is available, and at the increases in those floors from £14,250 to £20,000 and up to £100,000"
4912,"On the matter of confidence, the House of Commons Library has rather helpfully told us that half the public think there is inadequate regulation of political party spending and that only 14% think there is transparency around it"
4913,8 billion levellingup fund will invest in infrastructure to improve everyday local life and boost growth and jobs
4914," We are putting an additional £5 million into armed forces charities, bringing that support to more than £25 million this year, and an additional £2"
4915,"7 million into Operation Courage, bringing that total support to £20 million this year"
4916, 3MC
4917,"Some 90% of the public think that polling station voting is safe from fraud and abuse, and they are right to think that"
4918," Personation, which is the only problem the voter ID provisions of the Elections Bill are designed to address, resulted in a single conviction in 2016, 2017 and 2019, and zero convictions in 2018"
4919, Given that up to 3
4920,"5 million people may not have suitable ID and that the Governments pilots confirmed that up to 324,000 people would be denied a vote in a Great Britain election, let me ask the simple question why are this Government prepared to embark on voter suppression on an industrial scale"
4921,"According to the Electoral Reform Society, around 2"
4922,1 million people risk not being able to vote in a general election due to not having recognisable photo ID
4923," of the electorate already own an accepted form of photographic identification, including 99% of black, Asian and minority ethnic electors and 99% of young electors aged 18 to 29"
4924," The Electoral Commissions survey on this matter offers reassurance because the majority of the public say that a requirement to show identification when voting at polling stations would make them more confident, and 66% of people want more confidence in the security of the system"
4925," She really ought to read the 2015 Tower Hamlets election court judgment, where she will see the nature of the problem at hand"
4926, Research by the charity SSAFA has found that 77% of the veterans it works with felt that they were not fully prepared for civilian life
4927," Member for East Renfrewshire Kirsten Oswald knows, in Northern Ireland there has been a requirement for photographic identification at polling stations since 2003, and it operates with ease and is a proven and effective way of tackling fraud"
4928," As he says, this has been  working extremely well in Northern Ireland, which in fact has had an ID requirement since 1985it is the photographic ID requirement it has had since 2003"
4929,"In his evaluation, has the Minister looked at the experience of a number of European countries where this is happening and British holidaymakers and visitors are using the system without any detriment Has he looked at the views of Scotland and Wales, which are introducing certificates Can he assure the House of his view that in the event of its looking as though this may be necessary, it must be better to have vaccine passes than once again locking down the hospitality, entertainment and leisure industries, given the impact not only on customers but on hundreds of thousands of jobs"
4930," The NHS will be spending the best part of £150 billion a year, and it is vital that the best value is achieved with every penny that is spent"
4931,"1 It is an offence under the law of Northern Ireland for a person who is in Northern Ireland, or for a person who is outside Northern Ireland but who is a United Kingdom national or habitually resident in Northern Ireland, to aid, abet, counsel or procure the carrying out of virginity testing that has a sufficient jurisdictional connection"
4932,"Amendments proposed 86, page 117, line 34, after 2 insert 2A, 2B"
4933," I am hugely encouraged by the support that the Bill has received from so many quarters, from the NHS Confederation to the Kings Fund, the Health Committee and even those on the Opposition Front Bench"
4934," His Department told me back in May that 4 million people have been discharged under discharge to assessthat is, having their care needs assessed after they have left hospital rather than beforebut the same Department did not know what the clinical outcomes were and it did not know how many people had been readmitted to hospital within 30 days"
4935," I just put it on the record that 60% of people in Northern Ireland are opposed to abortion on demand, so when it comes to representing the views of those in Northern Irelandelected representatives and the local peopleI am afraid that Westminster and the House do not relate to the people of Northern Ireland on abortion"
4936," It is not right and not fair that the heaviest burdens often fall on those who are least able to bear it, so we are introducing a cap on the costs of care so that no one will have to pay more than £86,000 over their lifetime"
4937," We spend well over £140 billion pounds of taxpayers money on our healthcare system, so it is right that there is more accountability to this place"
4938," Somebody with a £1 million house will have 90% of that asset protected, but somebody with an £80,000 house in Barrow, Mansfield or Hartlepool will lose nearly everything"
4939," We have seen a £10 billion contract going to the private sector to use 8,000 beds"
4940," The most isolated of those hospitals is St Marys on the Isle of Wight, which has a 100% isolation factor because it is separated from everywhere else by sea"
4941," On the Island, our additional costs are estimated, at 2019 prices, to be some £12 million a year"
4942," Their passion in this House is matched by many in my constituency who, despite the fact that their view is constantly disregarded, still urge me in their hundredsI received hundreds of emails yesterday and hundreds todayto do what I can to speak for life"
4943, An opinion poll found that 60% of constituents were opposed to abortion on demand
4944," That is why the Secretary of State, through the winter access fund, has addressed the issue in two ways the availability of the cloudbased telephone system that GPs and primary care networks can be a part of, which will help to build their telephone capacity; and the £250 million winter access fund, which GPs can use to either recruit more telephone receptionists and train up existing telephone receptionists or build up more resources"
4945,1 Section 13A of the National Health Service Act 2006 Mandate is amended in accordance with subsection 2
4946, The debate has to finish at 4
4947,I would like to call the Minister at 4
4948," We propose to amend the existing listing of HamasIzz alDin alQassem Brigades, or Hamas IDQ, in schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000 to cover Hamas in its entirety"
4949, Hamas is a militant Islamist movement that was established in 1987
4950, IDQ was proscribed by the UK in March 2001
4951," During the May 2021 conflict, over 4,000 rockets were fired indiscriminately into Israel"
4952," 1 priority, and I commend the order to the House"
4953, We on the Opposition Benches appreciate the difficult balance that must be struck when considering the application of the test in section 3 of the Terrorism Act 2000
4954, The previous  Labour Government proscribed Hamass military wing in 2001 and made the assessment that there was at that time a meaningful distinction between the military and political wings
4955," Our worldleading security services have prevented 31 attacks since 2017; we thank them for their dangerous, careful and painstaking work"
4956," Nearly 2 million people are administered by the local Administration, who, strangely enough, have their own security forces"
4957," The history is very long, going back to the Balfour declaration in 1917"
4958," We delivered half of the Balfour declaration, perhaps one of the great moral projects of the 20th century, where we gave the Jewish people, who had suffered the most appalling, the greatest crime in human history in the holocaust, as well as the pogroms and all the other oppression in European history and elsewhere, a safe place in the state of Israel"
4959, Obviously half of that declaration is undeliveredthe bit that said it would not be done at the cost of the rights of the people already there
4960," That is why we have the Balfour project, led by our former consulgeneral in Jerusalem, Sir Vincent Feen, who is working away to draw attention to the fact that the work is half done and the United Kingdom still has to deliver the Balfour declaration"
4961," Why not United Nations Relief and Works Agency funding from the United Kingdom is going from £70 million to £20 million, which puts a huge responsibility on civil society to try to make up the difference because of the desperate, desperate situation in Gaza"
4962," Three quarters of UK victims online say that they have experienced abuse or harassment from anonymous accounts, and one in four people in the UK has been a victim of some type of online abusewe can see the levels that we are dealing with"

5354," From the start, the register needs a framework of rules that commands confidence and ensures the completeness and accuracy of information, so our amendments 5 and 6 to clause 7 would require that entries on the register be updated within 14 days of any trigger event, namely the change or removal of a beneficial owner"
5355," The idea that such a fine would deter those who fail to comply is frankly ridiculous, so we support Government amendments 45 and 46, which directly replace ours and will raise the fine to at least £2,500 a day"
5356," Labours amendments 15, 16 and 17 to schedules 3 and 4 would reduce the transitional period to 28 days, which in our view would provide enough time for overseas entities to get documents in order, while recognising the need to act urgently"
5357," Under Labours amendments 9, 13 and 14, all foreignbought properties would fall within the Bills scope, regardless of when they were purchased"
5358," We recognise that registering properties bought before 1999 in England and Wales or 2014 in Scotland may take more time, for reasons that the Minister has discussed, so our new clause 6 would allow an 18month transitional period for such properties, but it is important that we make sure that they are included in the scope of the Bill"
5359," That is why Labour has tabled new clause 7, which would require that the Secretary of State lay draft legislation on Companies House reform within 28 days of this Act coming into force"
5360, Member for Glasgow Central Alison Thewliss in new clause 4 on some of the areas associated with Companies House reform and verification
5361," The Government have accepted the principle of Labours new clause 8, which would require an annual update to be made to the  House on the use of UWOs, in their new clause 31"
5362," However, money laundering prosecutions have dropped by 38% in the past five years and the NCAs budget has dropped by 4"
5363,2% in real terms since 2016
5364," We support amendments 26, 27, 37 and 38, new clauses 2 and 9, and new clause 29, among others"
5365," It might disclose individual named nominees, but it would not then disclose the people on whose behalf the nominees hold the property"
5366," The logical way to do that is by introducing an amendment to introduce the same provisions we are introducing here into section 790C7 I am sorry, again, about the lengthof the Companies Act 2006"
5367,8 FTEThis information can be found in HM Treasurys Outcome Delivery Plan
5368, That is why new clause 2 is so very important
5369, Paragraph 3
5370,1
5371,"3 of the UK financial sanctions guidance in December 2020 says that the use of an asset, even when it is frozen, is not prohibited"
5372," Clauses 1 to 6 provide an overview of the register, define an overseas entity and establish the register and registration process"
5373, Clauses 7 to 11 set out the duties for updating and removing entities from the register
5374," Such powers underpinned the restraining, freezing or seizure of more than £979 millionworth of assets in 202021"
5375," Amendment 3 would not have the effect that we believe is sought, but I can see the potential merit in such an amendment and assure the House that we will look further at the intent behind the proposal to see whether there is a workable alternative"
5376," Member for Barking for tabling new clause 2, which seeks to place an obligation on the Secretary of State to provide additional reporting on the funding of enforcement agencies"
5377, The combination of this years spending review settlement and the private sector contributions through the levy will provide around £400 million of funding in respect of economic crime over the spending review period
5378," Since 200607, just under £1"
5379,"2 billionworth of assets recovered under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 have been returned to law enforcement agencies, prosecutors and the courts to fund further assetrecovery capability or work that protects the public from harm"
5380," I also support new clauses 7 and 2, which seek to beef up enforcement"
5381,8 fulltime equivalent staff
5382," It is welcome that the Government have increased the penalties, but I still fear that we are talking about people for whom billions of pounds are the standard currency that they are dealing with"
5383," For minor errors such as submitting a late return, there is usually a fixed penalty of a few hundred pounds, but if a tax return is intentionally wrong, or there has been a lack of reasonable care, HMRC levies penalties as a percentage of the tax dueup to 30% for carelessness and up to 70% for deliberate inaccuracy"
5384," Two years ago, the anticorruption campaign group Global Witness looked at this and found that 4,000 of the people registered as a person of significant control were under the age of two, while one had not even been born yet"
5385," At the opposite end of the spectrum, its researchers found that five individuals each controlled more than 6,000 companies"
5386, There are more than 4 million companies registered at Companies House
5387," According to The New York Post, the former owner of Chelsea football club transferred £92 million of New York City property to his exwife, Dasha Zhukova, just before the 2018 round of sanctions was announced"
5388," Maiyas real estate empire covers more than £50 millionworth of property in Moscow alone and includes at least three companies, including Katina, which owns prime oceanfront real estate in Croatia"
5389,"I rise to speak specifically to new clause 2, on the funding of enforcement agencies, but I wish to say a couple of things about the amendments in general"
5390, I am glad he is going to talk to us about amendment 3
5391," Fraud is now the most common crime committed in the UK, with more than 5 million offences, but hardly any are prosecuted"
5392,"7% in 201617 to 67% in 202021, so we are pursuing fewer criminals and we are being less successful in getting convictions"
5393," Just to be absolutely clear, that is equivalent to 0"
5394,"042% of GDP, and that is a generous estimate that I have put together"
5395," Even though the most recent estimate that I have seen of the cost of economic crime is around £290 billion, which is well over 10% of GDP, the National Crime Agency has suffered a 4"
5396,2% cut in its core budget over the past five years
5397," In contrast, I met a group of antifinancial crime executives working for the banks and they told me that the regulated financial services sector spendshold your breath£49"
5398,5 billion every year on financial crime compliance
5399, Our £852 million is just too small in comparison
5400,It always seems to me absurd that it costs £12 to establish a new company in Companies House
5401," Obviously we want to make it easy for new businesses to enter the market, but £12 is absurd"
5402," We know that that gets exploited in relation to shell companies, but does it also facilitate economic crime If we quadrupled that figure to £50, it would still not be a fortune, but we would then have a massive investment that we could put into our enforcement agencies without raising any further money through taxation"
5403," The British bank was fined £842 million in America, but only £102 million here by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK"
5404," Between 2016 and 2021, the law enforcement bodies brought £3"
5405,9 billion back into the UK coffers
5406," If that money had been reinvested, which is one of the ideas for funding the enforcement agencies, it could have brought an extra three quarters of a billion pounds to be spent on enforcement by all those agencies"
5407, Our amendments 18 to 23 would lower the threshold for beneficial ownership from 25% to 10%
5408, New clauses 2 and 9 deal with that
5409," There are nowhere near enough resources applied to economic crime it represents 40% of all crime, but 1% of the resources"
5410," For example, last year I think the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, one of the bodies charged with enforcement, sanctioned two individuals or companies with collective fines of £85,000"
5411," In the US, a similar body levied 87 fines totalling £1"
5412,"5 billion, because it is properly resourced"
5413," Some 43% of all financial crimes are identified through whistleblowers, yet it is something we do not talk about"
5414," Airbus paid $3 billion in fines internationally and £900 million to the UK Treasury, and all that money came as a result of a disclosure from whistleblowers"
5415," So if you are thinking of blowing the whistle, will you do it My constituent, Ian Foxley, who was involved in the GPT Special Projects case that resulted in £28 million of financial sanctions at Southwark court last year, has been 11 years without a single penny"
5416," That man was earning £200,000 a year"
5417," The ASA issues enforcement notices to online retailers where parcel surcharging practices are raised, and it has achieved a compliance rate of over 95%"
5418," Friend the Member for Moray described one of the 5%, where, because of the way it was phrased, the ASA let them get away with it"
5419, May I ask him specifically for an update on the £900 million that I have requested for South Yorkshire to match the shared prosperity fund commitments that the Government have rightly made to Cornwall
5420,I am delighted that the UK Government have recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Wrexham and Denbighshire councils in order to allow the first phase of the £13
5421,3 million levellingup projects in Clwyd South to progress
5422,1 The Secretary of State may by notice publish the name of a person being considered as a subject for sanctions
5423,"Amendments made 50, page 16, line 11, leave out £500 and onetenth and insert £2,500 and one half"
5424,"I rise to speak in support of new clauses 7 and 8, but I want to start by expressing my solidarity with the people of Ukraine, who face unimaginable heartbreak and horror, and particularly to black residents who have been subject to unacceptable levels of racism and brutality"
5425," Since as early as 2016, the Government have been making empty promises for tighter regulations to prevent these illicit activities, but since then, £1"
5426,5 billionworth of property here has been bought by Russian oligarchs accused of corruption with links to the Kremlin
5427, Given the almost £2 million received in Russialinked donations by the Tory party since the current Prime Minister entered No
5428,"I rise to speak to the amendments in my name new clause 5 and, in particular, amendment 4, which is supported by the crossparty group that has been trying to get our ducks in a row"
5429, I heard what the Minister said about Economic Crime Bill 2
5430," It sounds like the promise of the good sequel after the filmit is coming and it will be even bigger and better, with bigger stars than the first onebut we all know how sometimes part 2 can be a flop"
5431, I sincerely hope that part 2 will come sooner
5432, I wonder whether we might want to try to do that with part 2 and part 3 and get the sequels out as quickly as possible because each one will be pretty meaty and need time
5433, I hope that Economic Crime Bill 2 will have all the necessary powers to clamp down on that activity
5434, Many of them own companies that potentially employ thousands of people in this country
5435," We have all seen the reckless assault on nuclear facilities and the apparent use of cluster bombs and indiscriminate weaponry in civilian areas, but we have also all seen the incredible bravery and patriotism of the Ukrainian people, with hundreds of thousands of volunteers from all walks of life picking up arms and fighting and dying for their country"
5436," I understand why getting directly involved in this conflict could lead to much wider suffering and conflict, but because we are letting others fight and die on our behalf, it is incumbent on us to do everything else we possibly can to help them"
5437," It was the Labour party that introduced the tier 1 visa, which seems to have been one of the ways in which this country has been exploited"
5438,  Representatives of Americas justice system suggest that billions of poundsworth of properties are hidden in New York limited liability companies
5439," Whether it was behind closed doors, or in plain sight when they proceeded with the plans for Nord Stream 2, we know that ultimately that money and those projects date back to a corrupt, criminal regime that stole its funding from the Russian people"
5440, It is very important that this is included in part 2 of the Bill
5441,1 Section 11 of the 2018 Act designation of a person by name under a designation power is amended in accordance with subsections 2 to 6
5442,1 Section 12 of the 2018 Act designation by persons by description under a designation power is amended in accordance with subsections 2 to 9
5443, It is substantially the same as NC40 but refers in subsection 2 to Part 3 of the Sanctions and AntiMoney Laundering Act 2018 as well as to Part 1
5444, This new clause would therefore allow an appropriate Minister to make consequential amendments to Parts 1 and 3 of the 2018 Act and regulations made under Part 1 of that Act; and amendments to Parts 1 and 3 would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure whereas in NC40 only amendments to Part 1 would be subject to that procedure and amendments to Part 3 would be subject to negative resolution
5445," What we should be looking for is provisions that match the rights acquired under article 1 of the first protocolnamely, rights to propertyand clearly, there need to be qualifications on that in circumstances such as these"
5446, Members new clauses 2 and 3
5447," New clause 2 would bring long overdue scrutiny of that significant weakness, and renewed support for our enforcement agencies"
5448," That is why we will also be supporting new clause 3, as well as amendment 41, tabled by my SNP colleagues, in order to curb the ability of shell companies and other indirect ownership instruments, as well as their paid  London enablers, to obfuscate ownership structures for their clients"
5449," Those measures, along with new clauses 4 and 9, will tighten the massive loophole that prevents us from having a properly resourced, properly empowered and properly directed Companies House"
5450, The Government are doing something in this Bill to try to improve the equality of arms between Government lawyers and the multimillionpoundsayear lawyers on the other side
5451," If nominees are directed by someone elsesay, the beneficial ownerthe person doing the directing is caught by condition 4 in paragraph 6 of schedule 2 and is therefore a registerable beneficial owner"
5452," However, in my article in The Northern Scot this week explaining to my constituents that I was having this Adjournment debate, I said that hopefully we would get to it quicker than last Mondays, which started at 1"
5453, Amendment 4 is very simpleit would delete this now
5454," We would have pressed new clause 4 to a vote, had it not been so similar in intention to the official Oppositions new clause 7"
5455," The Hyde Group recently billed tenants £9,000 a year for waking watch, although, thankfully, it rescinded it"
5456," Leaseholders from the Renaissance buildings may be liable for £500,000 of costs relating to external wall investigations and the building safety fund application"
5457, Multimillionpound car collections will be loaded into jets; anchors will be weighed on superyachts; priceless artworks will be squirrelled awayall to wend their way back to Russia or some other safe haven for these people
5458," Similarly, we are committed to consulting Northern Ireland Ministers on regulations made under the similar mechanism for Northern Ireland in clause 324, 5 and 6"
5459, The levels were £2 million and £10 million
5460," If someone had £10 million, they could get their permanent right to remain in the UK fasttracked, and they could end up with UK citizenship"
5461," I refer to amendment 41, new clauses 4 and 21 to 23, and amendments 18 to 23  and 40"
5462,"The Governments rough sleeping snapshot recorded 2,440 people sleeping rough throughout the whole UK in the autumn"
5463,We have committed more than £800 million to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping in this year alone
5464," That includes the investment of £202 million through the rough sleeping initiative fund, which provides 14,500 bed spaces and approximately 2,700 staff throughout the country"
5465," We are also helping people to find longerterm accommodation, including through the £433 million rough sleeping accommodation programme, which we expect to provide 6,000 new homes before the end of this Parliament"
5466," Given that the new build premium is continuing to rise, and given that UK house price index data suggest that average house prices in England have increased by 18% since the scheme was first consulted on, can the Minister tell us in how many local authority areas the discount on those homes has not already been entirely eroded"
5467," We already have the First Homes scheme, which provides a 30% discount for local people, for whom those homes remain in perpetuity"
5468," Homes Englands early delivery programme will provide a further 1,500 homes, but of course we will monitor these developments and do everything we can to help people get on to the property ladder"
5469," The affordable homes programme that the Government have announced, with £11"
5470,"5 billionworth of investment, will help to secure that, so that we can try to deliver the 180,000 homes that that is expected to deliver"
5471," May I clarify it The Minister agreed to look at our amendment 3, which addresses the question of whether this is an entity or an individual, and whether, if it is an entity, that entity can put forward a company provider and thus hide the identity of the owner of the property"
5472," The SNPs new clause 4 would make Companies House an antimoney laundering supervisor, as it is strange that Companies House is not"
5473," Of the thousands of Scottish limited partnerships that have registered no person of significant control, there has now been a single fine of £210"
5474, We know they have been used  to launder millions of pounds in dirty money created by illicit business activities
5475,3 million in donations not to the Putin cronies who gave it to them but to those who have been harmed by Putin and his regime
5476," In the legislation, schedule 3 paragraph 6 requires the Land Registry to do that, and it can prohibit or restrict a transfer or a sale"
5477," To put that into context, the same report says that 87% of adults in the United Kingdom buy online"
5478, That figure rose as high as 95% during the pandemic
5479," That means that a big number of shoppers95% of 440,000 peopleare being punished not for what they want to buy, but because of where they want to buy from"
5480," The Scottish Parliament Information Centres report says that the additional cost of delivery charges in commonly affected areas, compared with the rest of Scotland, is £45 million"
5481," That is £45 million that someone has to pay because they live in Moray, Inverness or one of many areas north of Perthnot the cost of the products, but the cost to deliver them"
5482," A Findhorn resident tried to order a battery for a strimmer and was told it would be £30 to deliver to the IV36 postcode, which was almost more than the cost of the battery itself"
5483," Another constituent in Dyke was quoted £15 to order a tap for his motor home, even though free UK delivery was advertised"
5484, A constituent from Forres ordered goods worth £89 and the company was offering free delivery on orders over £40
5485, She put in her IV36 postcode and the delivery charge rose to £117
5486," So from free delivery for purchases of over £40, for her purchase of £89 it then became £117"
5487, Normal delivery was going to be £9
5488,"95, but they entered their IV36 postcode and an additional £40 was added, taking the total delivery cost to £50"
5489," Another constituent put in an order for some garden equipment and although free UK mainland delivery was advertised, they were asked to pay a surcharge of £24 for Scottish highlands"
5490," Finally, a product was ordered by one of my constituents in Elgin and they were told that the delivery charge was going to be £149"
5491, So by travelling 10 miles within Moray one can go from a charge of almost £150 for delivery to having no charge at all
5492," Another constituent in Elgin bought a bed for £435 and the order went through and was completed, but several days later she was contacted to say, Actually, we have looked at your address and there is going to be a £70 surcharge for delivery"
5493," They believed that they were going to pay a certain amount, only then to get a phone call or an email to say, Actually, weve found out where you live, we think it is too far away and we are going to put on another £70"
5494," The cost of the gardening tool was £40, but she was going to be charged £2,000 for delivery"
5495," The delivery charge for a £40 product came in at £2,001,997"

5502," If we look at the total financial impactthe aim here is to debilitate the Russian economywe can see that the sanctions we have put on banks, defence, aviation and oligarchs add up to £364 billion"
5503," In the US, they add up to £340 billion, and in the EU, they add up to £124 billion"
5504,"The Foreign Secretary knows that a vital way to help Ukraine is to prevent those who have stolen money from the Russian people from hiding it in our capital city, but after years of austerity, our hollowedout enforcement agencies simply do not have the resources to go toe to toe with billionaire oligarchs"
5505," In 2020, the debt stood at $94 billion"
5506," We are the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian aid to Ukraine, including with our largest ever UK Aid Match contribution to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal, which has now raised more than £100 million"

5512,"On International Womens Day, Europe is leading and united in welcoming more than 2 million refugees, almost all of whom are women and children, fleeing the bloody and murderous war by Putin against Ukraine and its citizens"
5513," Lady agree that one way we can help Crimea and the whole of Ukraine is to ensure that people in Russia and Russiancontrolled territories know the truth of the murderous barbarity being done in their name Will she be encouragedI am sure she isby the fact that, in the past week, visits to the BBCs Russian language website have trebled However, that is only 10 million people, and there are 150 million people in Russia"
5514," The UK has targeted £364 billionworth of assets, whereas the US has targeted £340 billion and the EU has targeted £124 billion"
5515," We have targeted and sanctioned £364 billionworth of assets, whereas the EU has targeted £124 billion"
5516, That saved thousands of lives and helped to document the atrocities
5517," The world of royal charters and the Privy Council approvals process may feel a million miles away from the new institute of technology agenda, but when I explain the reason for this proposal, then all should, and I hope will, become very clear"
5518," IOTs are a new type of provider designed specifically to deliver the technical STEMscience, technology, engineering and mathsskills, mainly at levels 4 and 5, that employers and our economy need"
5519, It received capital funding of over £17 million and launched last year with a range of new courses based on both campuses in Swindon

5522," On top of this, thousands more adults will be able to access free and flexible training, and get the skills needed in sectors that are booming, such as green technologies, digital and construction"
5523," As I said at the beginning of my speech, what seems like a dry procedure is in fact the opening of a door to new opportunities and an effective means of ensuring that skills qualifications, which are a vital way of increasing productivity, get the recognition they clearly deserve and that IOTs, which offer lifechanging opportunities to thousands of people, will be a permanent part of our educational landscape"

5539," There is also no plan to deal with massive MOD waste, despite at least £13 billion of taxpayers money being wasted through MOD mismanagement or misjudgment since 2010, with £4 billion wasted in the past couple of years alone while the present Defence Secretary has been in post"
5540," Restoring the Challenger fleet to full strength would cost an estimated £430 million, equivalent to the money wasted by the MOD"
5541," Creative accounting with rosetinted projections, which plan for undetermined savings to accrue to the MODs balance sheet at some unspecified point in the future, is the culture that manifests claims that we will see the plan come in £4"

5546, The Departments financial plans once again assume further unspecified workforce cuts of £2

5549, This Government provided defence with a fouryear settlement and a £24 billion increase in the defence budget

5559, We will ensure that the extra £24 billion that we have to invest in defence is spent wisely and appropriately
5560," We will also ensure that, as we made clear in the IR, with that £24 billion of extra investment in defence, we will have the armed forces that we require to deter and defend"
5561," Friend the Secretary of State for Levelling Up will be setting out a route by which the British peoplenot just the family reunion route, which can run into the hundreds of thousands, but a route by which everybody in this countrycan offer a home to people fleeing Ukraine"
5562," In 2010, a Conservative party came into power, in the coalition Government, that had argued before the election for more spending on everything in defence, but then, suddenly, they got into a programme of austerity, under the cloud of a mythical £38 billion black hole that the bad Labour Government had left them"
5563," I welcome things like the national shipbuilding strategy, but I am appalled that, even this week, the MOD has given a £10 million contract to a Dutch yard for a vessel that could have been built here"
5564," As a result, we need to look at absolute numbers in respect of what we need to invest in defence to achieve the things we want to achieve we must not be hung up on a particular percentageofGDP target, because that is going to be a moving feast and I think we will, unfortunately, be in a fairly major recession before too long"
5565," In June 2021, the National Audit Office published a report entitled, Improving the Performance of Major Equipment Contracts, because it was picking up on a catalogue of failures, of late delivery, of equipment being delivered that was not fit for purpose, and of contracts going hundreds of millionssometimes billions of pounds over budget"
5566," We identified, for example, that the contract for four Astuteclass attack submarines was more than £1 billion above budget and the Queen Elizabethclass aircraft carriers were £2"
5567,75 billion over budget
5568," It is easy to look at those numbers in the context of the total MOD budget and say that none individually is a huge percentage, but when we think what £3 billion, £4 billion or £5 billion could do to improve the accommodation that service personnel are living in, for example, and what that would do for morale, that waste of public money is simply inexcusable"
5569," I could talk until 7 oclock, if the right hon"
5570,"5 billion of additional funding to address the backlog in maintenance and repairs of that accommodation, which at the time was estimated to be about £1"
5571," I think it is dishonest to state as a matter of fact that the equipment plan is affordable, because in order for it to be affordable, as the NAO report states in paragraph 2"
5572,"7, £3 billion of financial risk was not included"
5573," For example, a future combat air system had an estimated cost in its business case up to 2031 of between £10 billion and £17 billion"
5574, The equipment plan allocates £8
5575,"65 billion, so that one project alone is, at best, underfunded by £1"
5576,"35 billion, and at worst it has possibly been allocated barely half the money it will cost"
5577,17 refers to £7 billion of what the MOD terms Planned Cost ReductionsI think this is what the right hon
5578," At the time, according to that report, the toplevel budget holders had plans to deliver less than half of the £3"
5579,1 billion
5580, Some £2
5581,"6 billion of it needed to be achieved by 2025, within the first four years, and the first of those first four years is up in three weeks time"
5582," It cannot afford to get it wrong this time, but I think we all know that the chances of it getting it right and delivering that £7 billion, if its past record is anything to go by, are very slight"
5583," An independent assessment carried out by the MODs cost assurance and analysis service, looking at projects that make up about 58% of the current years planalthough clearly there will be bigger expenditure on some of them laterreckoned that those projects alone were likely to cost £7"
5584,6 billion more than was assumed in the makeup of the defence equipment plan
5585,5% budget increase every year up to 2031
5586," It is costing billions and billions of pounds that the MOD simply cannot afford to waste, and there will be times when it risks costing the lives of our service personnel"
5587, The first is on the continual debate about percentage spending
5588, We should always remember that 2% is the minimum we are expected to spend on defence by NATO
5589, We now need to look very much at what that 2% is
5590," What does the 2% mean when it comes to UK defence spending A 2016 report by the Defence Committee called Shifting the goalposts showed that now the 2% includes war pensions, contributions to United Nations peacekeeping, pensions for retired civilian MOD personnel and MOD income, among other things"
5591," Fair enough, if that is to be included in defence spending, that is to be included in defence spending, but we should not for one minute assume that if we are saying we are spending 2% of GDP on defence, it is being spent on defence equipment or on personnel; it now covers a far bigger, wider range of things than it used to when we were calculating what we were contributing to the overall NATO budget"
5592, We must remember that people such as President Putin are the direct descendants of the regime whose ideology led them to kill millions of their own people in the decades in which Leninism and bolshevism held sway
5593," It is a fact that, in the aftermath of the Korean war, defence spending as a proportion of GDP at one point was as high as 7%"
5594," In about 1963, it crossed over with spending on welfare at 6%"
5595," That was all a long time ago, but as recently as the 1980s the spending on health, education and defence was roughly the same at just over 4% of GDP"
5596,I do agree with that point; using GDP percentages has always been only a very rough and ready guide
5597,1% on the old method of calculation and 3
5598,"6% on the new method of calculation, whereby the MOD is allowed to include certain things we never used to include, it then became an argument as to whether we would even manage to achieve 2% of GDP"
5599," Our expectations have been managed down so far that when, even in recent times, a number of us have called for 3% to be a target, it was regarded as being completely out of reach"
5600," The sort of effort we put into defending this country is the most important investment we can make, so 3% of GDP should now be seen not as a target or as a minimum, but as a stepping stone on the way to a realistic investment to meet the threat that never really went away, the reality of which in Ukraine has now been proclaimed for all the world to see"
5601," I found the IR quite frustrating, because the focus was on not making bad press announcements about the removal of regiments, although we have obviously heard the example of 2 Mercian"

5605," May I make two requests from that First, it is reported that there are many thousands of unaccompanied Ukrainian children across the border, who have been taken there for safety, and that the number is growing"
5606," We supplied them with 2,000 antitank missiles before the invasion, and I welcome what he said in his statement about what we are doing today"
5607," The initial supply was to be 2,000 new light antitank weapons, small arms and ammunition"
5608," I can update the House that, as of today, we have delivered 3,615 NLAWs and continue to deliver more"
5609," To date, the international community has donated more than 900 manportable air defence missiles and thousands of antitank guided weapons of varying types, as well as various small arms"
5610," Today the estimated number of Ukrainian civilians killed or injured stands at more than 1,000, but the true figure is expected to be much higher, and I am afraid that worse is likely to come"
5611," It is for that reason that the UK will increase its funding for Ukraine to £220 million, which includes £120 million of humanitarian aid"
5612," We have put over 1,000 more British troops on readiness to support humanitarian responses in the bordering countries"
5613,I agree 100% with my hon
5614," If there is a message from the House, which seems to be in agreement, it is that we need to spend more on defenceup to 3%and to reverse the cuts, before it is too late, to the infantry"
5615," In the light of Russias invasion, Germany has announced an increase in its defence spending, including a 100 billion fund to upgrade its armed forces"
5616," I do not want the impression to be abroad that Private Stone, doubling forward by half section with his Carl Gustaf, made a huge contribution to the defence of the realm"
5617," The only question is whether we end up at 3% quickly or slowly, because I think that that will be the direction of travel"
5618, There will be a great deal of support from Conservative Members for moving from 2%however the figures were added uptowards 3% or more
5619," He has designated a oneoff sum of 100 billion to set up a special fund, and has pledged an annual 2% of GDP"
5620," In the 12 months running up to 30 September 2021, the Royal Navy had an uplift in recruitment of 4"
5621,"3%, the Army had an uplift of 25"
5622,2% and the RAF had an uplift of 8
5623," One of the things that came up when we were having the debate around foreign aid was whether we should look at certain reforms, and if we return to 0"
5624,"7%, I would really like us to look at ways in which some of that money could be spent through the Ministry of Defence to support our armed forces to undertake humanitarian missions"
5625,"In commending the Government for their robust response to this dreadful invasion and notwithstanding existing levels of support and our article 5 commitment to NATO, the Government are right to rule out a nofly zone and also to emphasise that it is a difficult balance to ensure that any defensive support is calibrated not to escalate matters to a strategic level"
5626," Friend will agree that Poland is making a huge humanitarian effort, supporting hundreds of thousands of refugees and proposing military support"
5627,"In February this year we put a further £250 million into the Executive to allow them more flexibility, on top of their underspend, to support people at a time when there are such pressures"
5628,I am afraid that is the $60 million question
5629," Does he agree that we are not going to deter further Russian adventurism with a £4 billion light tank that not only does not work, but deafens its own crew"
5630," I challenged the Minister before Christmas as to whether his Department was going to give a £10 million contract to Damen in the Netherlands for a special naval vehicle, and he said we should wait for the competition"
5631," Some 36% of those 80,000 people were living in accommodation rated grade 4 or below"
5632," At a cost of about £150 million per aircraft, the fleet of 14 would have cost £2"
5633,"1 billion, comparable to the amount of money that the MOD has wasted on writeoffs since 2010"
5634," Some examples that Labour has uncovered are simply embarrassing, such as £64 million wasted on admin errors"
5635," and gallant Members how much they would like to see numbers in the Army go up, but they do not talk so much about the cost of the Defence Nuclear Organisation, which is 50% higher than that of the next department, the Army"
5636," Gentlemans remarks, and we believe the £4 billion figure is wholly spurious"
5637,There was a report from Reuters yesterday that dozens of former Paras have signed up for the Ukrainian foreign legion and that hundreds more are expected to do so
5638," Will the Secretary of State say a little more about the 1,000 UK troops who I understand from his statement are still on standby to provide humanitarian assistance Where are they and under what circumstances will they be deployed"
5639," Nevertheless, the commitment to article 5 is important"
5640," Also, one way the Ukrainians are delivering close air supportor, actually,  fires in depthis through the Turkish TB2 unmanned aerial vehicles, which are delivering munitions to their artillery and, indeed, their supply lines, which are credibly important, in order to slow down or block the Russian advance"

5642, There would also be a requirement under subsection 3 to record certain information in a register of cat and cat owner reunification organisations

5647,I am not sure I am in a position to give betting odds in terms of percentages
5648," These are political decisions that have been taken, and nearly 30% of our procurement is now bought off the shelf from the United States, with no commitment from companies such as Boeing to reinvest to ensure that not only jobs but technology stay in the UK"
5649," She is absolutely right to make the point that men are 99% of the problem, but we can be 50% of the solution"

5654," Violence extends to children, too; 60 million girls are being sexually assaulted on their way to school every year"
5655," Last year, less than 2% of rape cases ended in conviction, adding insult to injury for survivors who find the strength to come forward and report rapewhich only one in six women actually do, because they mistrust the system"
5656," Although such a measure would not be a silver bullet, there are many reasons why it would mean progress it would allow for the more accurate collection of data on harassment and make the collection of such data mandatory; it would set a precedent that such behaviour is unacceptable; it would curb the street harassment that 68% of all women experience on a near daily basis;  and it would stamp out lowlevel behaviour based on misogyny so that it would not lead to much more serious offences based on misogyny"
5657," This violence affects 51% of the populationwomen who work, women who vote, women watching as we fail to do anything at all to reduce these horrific statistics"

5661," More than 60% of women accessing mental health services have experienced domestic abusean appalling statistic at the heart of the Womens Aid campaign, DeserveToBeHeard, rightly promoted by my hon"
5662, That is one of many reasons why we have committed to guarantee mental health treatment within a month for all who need it and enable 1 million more people to access treatment
5663," Friend the Member for Coventry North West Taiwo Owatemi has repeatedly emphasised, black women are now 40% more likely than white women to experience miscarriage and four times more likely to die while pregnant, yet we still lack any hard targets for improvement"
5664," Womenled small and mediumsized enterprises contribute about £85 billion to economic output, and companies in which women are more prominent are ultimately more successful, yet women are still less likely to be able to access as much finance as men when they try to set up companies, and only eight of the FTSE 100s chief executive officers are women"
5665," It disrupts essentials services such as health and education that so many women and girls rely on, and it leads to the displacement of millions of people"
5666," According to the domestic violence charity Sistah Space, 86% of women of African or Caribbean heritage in the UK have either been a victim of domestic abuse or know a family member who has been assaulted"

5762," Certainly the 1,700 of us who stood together in Winchester cathedral on Saturday with our prayers for Ukraine are very appreciative"
5764,"I also welcome this scheme, and my constituents have been contacting me about what they can do to provide such accommodation, but can I gently remind the Secretary of State that there are still thousands of women, activists, prosecutors, judges and others in Afghanistan who are still waiting to hear from the Afghan resettlement scheme Will this type of scheme include those people in a further rollout"
5765,  Ofcoms recent affordability report found that 1
5766,1 million households are struggling to afford broadband
5767,We have delivered more than 1
5768,"9 million devices to schools, colleges and local authorities for disadvantaged pupils, as part of a £520 million investment during the pandemic"
5769,"Can the Minister confirm that, from September, up to 3,000 new places are being created for children with special educational needs and disability through 35 new special free schools"
5770," Throughout the review we have listened to hundreds of organisationsincluding the National Network of Parent Carer Forums, Let Us Learn Too and Special Needs Junglechildren and parents"
5771,"The Government are investing £290 million to establish a network of 21 institutes of technology throughout the country, actively targeting the areas where they are needed the most"
5772," Wave 1 has already established 12 IOTs across 50 locations, and wave 2 will add a further nine IOTs"
5773,"I rise to speak to amendment 3, which stands in the name of my hon"
5774," Amendment 3, which we will be pressing to a vote, would require the Secretary of State to ensure that there are representatives for each of the devolved nations on the centres board"
5775," I will whip through each amendment in turn, starting with new clause 2"
5776, Member for Sefton Central is assured that we share the priority highlighted by new clause 4
5777," As of this morning, only 4,000 have been issued"
5778," Can he confirm that, if households are taking on a family or individual registered with a community support charitysuch as the Pickwell Foundation in North Devon, which has a proven track record of providing a warm, safe and sustainable welcome to refugeesthey will still receive the £350 a month"
5779, Friend on behalf of East Devon for the Homes for Ukraine scheme
5780," Would he be able to use the £350 a month housing allowance to, say, come to a rental agreement with the local authority Would the Secretary of State reconsider allowing local authorities and community bodies to access that £350 a month so that we can provide as much help as possible for as many refugees as possible"
5781," The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the Home Office have also been providing humanitarian support on the ground to Ukraines neighbours, helping them to cope with the displacement of hundreds of thousands of peoplebut more can, and must, be done"
5782," In recognition of their generosity, the Government will provide a monthly payment of £350 to sponsors for each family whom they look after"
5783," Indeed, Lord Harrington and I met them in order to ensure that we can expedite phase 2 as quickly as possible, and we will update the House in real time over the next few days"
5784,"The Secretary of State says he hopes that many people will be ready to open their home, but it seems that, due to Home Office guidance, none of the 3,000plus spare rooms offered to Afghan refugees by hosts across the UK has been used"
5785,"The Bill is much improved following its passage through the Lords and the scrutiny carried out in this House, not least by the addition of new clause 1, which was tabled by the Secretary of State on Report and addressed at least some of the concerns expressed about the devolution settlement"
5786,"I do not intend to detain the House for long, but it is a pleasure to rise to speak in support of Plaid Cymrus new clause 5, which would require the Secretary of State or the Lord Chancellor to obtain the consent of the devolved Governments when acting in areas of devolved competence"
5787," On the face of it, that would be an improvement to the existing position, but it is still something of a halfway house that causes confusion"
5788, 1590
5789," We will be giving greater executive power to a Prime Minister who, in defiance of the security services, ennobled the son of a former KGB officer turned billionaire Russian oligarch, a Prime Minister whose career three weeks ago was hanging by a thread and who has been revealed to be up to his neck in dirty Russian money, and a Prime Minister who is currently under investigation by the Metropolitan police"
5790,"The UK Government have given the Saudi regime an estimated £20 billion in arms sales since the start of the war in Yemen, despite clear breaches of humanitarian law"
5791, Will he direct his officials to go even faster on phase 2 of the scheme so that we get this rolled out as quickly as possible
5792,"I will speak to new clauses 3 and 4 tabled in my name, then briefly come back to the Government amendment and to amendment 3"
5793," Due to do the increased number of regulators in scope, the Government also had to publish an updated impact assessment, with the total cost to regulators increasing by almost £2 million"
5794, The provisions in clauses 3 and 4 will allow for the implementation of regulatortoregulator mutual recognition agreements and of the recognition arrangements in new international trade agreements
5795," That is why I tabled new clause 4, which would oblige the Secretary of State to provide guidance to regulators on how to make the most of the provisions in the TCA"
5796," I see from new clause 1, having read it a number of times, that it is consistent with what is in the internal market Act and I thank the Minister for listening to the concerns that we raised, even though the Government voted against our amendments in Committee"
5797," Members on that, and I trust that the Government will still seek consent, in the spirit of new clause 1, when applying the regulations that are relevant to the devolved Administrations"
5798, Member for Richmond Park Sarah Olney that we will be supporting amendment 3
5799," Sir Bill Wiggin, on behalf of the Committee of Selection"
5800," It promised young people 250,000 jobs and got barely half of that"
5801, Friend agree that the way to recovery for our economy and the cost of living is the multibillion pound plan for jobs that the Government are delivering
5802," That is lower than the 250,000 jobs that the scheme could have funded, but the scheme was designed at a time when unemployment was expected to peak at 12%"
5803," Friend the Chancellor, the economy has recovered better than expected and unemployment peaked at 5"
5804,2% in 2020
5805," In total, the Department for Work and Pensions spend on labour market support will be more than £6 billion over the next three years"
5806," The DWPs youth offer, which runs until 2025 and is worth £60 million, includes a 13week youth employment programme, supported youth hubs and, crucially, specialised youth employability coaches"
5807," The National Farmers Union sees it as a particular problem and estimates that some 1,100 quad bikes are stolen from farms each year, costing farmers upwards of £3 million"
5808," If just a fraction of those end up on public roads, that is hundreds of illegal quads running rampant on our streets"
5809," There were over 10,000 reports of antisocial use of quads and bikes in West Yorkshire in 2021, a shocking 42% rise on the previous year"
5810, Just one antisocial quad rider ripping through a neighbourhood will disturb hundreds and hundreds of residents
5811," That can take hundreds and hundreds of hours of police time, piecing together official reports from members of the public, scouring community intelligence on social media or reviewing CCTV from businesses such as petrol stations for that one frame showing the riders face, all to make a strong enough case to act"
5812, The Government will invest £3
5813,"8 billion in skills by 202425, which is equivalent to a cash increase of 42% compared with 201920"
5814," On apprenticeships, I am happy to say that last year more than 3,000 people started apprenticeships in my hon"
5815,"With the leave of the House, we will take motions 3 to 5 together"
5816,"Businesses in the steel industry are more likely to be able to support the kickstart scheme if the Government manage to get Donald Trumps unfair tariffs of 25% on British steel exports lifted, as the Japanese and the EU have already achieved"
5817," However, moving on, the Chancellor really listened when he moved to make sure that the taper rate was reduced to 55% in the autumn Budget; that is ongoing, and it recognises the principle of universal credit that people will be better off working than not working"
5818," Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer is a multimillionaire who has no idea what it is like to get by on poverty, as many of my constituents and those on these Opposition Benches do, has she suggested that he should follow the Scottish Governments approach of uprating benefits by 6% with a fixed budget Is that something she is planning to ask him to do on Wednesday, or is it going to be more of the same from her Departmentno action"
5819,"Most benefits and the state pension will rise by just 3% in April, but inflation could be over 8%, so that is a realterms cut of 5% for people who are already having to choose between eating and heating"
5820,The Government are providing support worth over £21 billion across this financial year and the next to help families with the cost of living
5821," Has the Secretary of State urged the Chancellor to reverse the £20 universal credit cut and rule it out to legacy claimants, or has she asked to replicate the Scottish Governments £20 per week child payment Where is her comprehensive plan to stop our constituents sufferingand by plan I do not mean more loans"
5822," We will be filling half a million new jobs by the summer through our Way to Work campaign; that will help people progress, and I hope the hon"
5823,"We know we are at record levels of inwork poverty, with more than 8 million people in that category, so why are three out of four people who were in lowpaid work in 2010 still in lowpaid work now"
5824," In fact, research by York University has found that securing  child maintenance payments would lift 60% of children living in singleparent households that currently are not receiving them out of poverty"
5825, 2
5826, That is partly because the message has gone out to all the many hundreds of thousands who might have been tempted that it is not worth trying
5827,"The windups will begin at 12 minutes past 4, as the Minister has kindly agreed to truncate his windup to get more time in"
5828," At roughly 18 minutes past 4, we are expecting multiple Divisions"
5829,"I call Alison Thewliss, whom I must ask to sit down at 4"
5830," Giving £54 million to the French to do something about this; making constant requests, which have been rebuffed, for meetings with the French Interior Minister and otherswhere have the Government not tried to engage constructively How would the hon"
5831," Let us be clear that the UK has designated more than 1,000 individuals, entities and subsidiaries under the Russia sanctions regime since the invasion, including President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov"
5832, More than 3 million Russian companies are barred from raising money on UK capital markets
5833, What people are asking me is this what are we doing to get some money back from Fujitsu This will cost the taxpayer potentially hundreds of millions of pounds
5834," To be clear, in the past week the Government have passed the Economic Crime Transparency and Enforcement Act 2022, established a register of beneficial ownership, and sanctioned more than 1,000 individuals and entities"
5835," Evidence from programmes such as Justice and Cares victim navigator programme shows that when given wraparound support over a longer period more victims develop the confidence to engage with criminal investigations; 89% of Justice and Cares supported victims engaged with police at the last published evaluation, which compared with the national average of about a third"
5836," That 48% were criminally exploited, so we must ensure that children who have been victims of county lines gangs have protection"
5837," To demonstrate how difficult it still is to have your migration status resolved upon recognition of your exploitation, data obtained from the Home Office shows that in 201920 only 2%, or 17 out of 754, of child victims of modern slavery in the UK were granted discretionary leave to remain"
5838," That would have a considerable impact, given that 91% of conclusive grounds decisions made in 2021  were positive, which means the Home Office deemed the individuals to be confirmed victims of modern slavery"
5839," The most recent number of referrals to the NRM was 12,727, representing a 20% increase in referrals compared to the previous yearthe highest number of referrals since the NRM began"
5840," I express on behalf of the whole House our sympathy with his family, friends and colleagues on this sad anniversary"
5841," I especially support Lords amendment 4, which removes the licence given to the Home Secretary to deprive British people of their citizenship without informing them"
5842," I also support Lords amendment 5, which seeks to ensure that the Bill does not violate the UKs shared international obligations under the refugee convention"
5843," Lords amendment 6, which removes from the Bill the power given to the Home Secretary to treat people differently according to the way that they arrive and claim asylum, must also be adopted to prevent a twotier system that would limit protection for refugees due not to their need but to their method of travel"
5844," Lords amendments 8 and 9 are steps in the right direction, yet they do not go far enough to prevent asylum seekers from being transferred to other countries and processed offshore"
5845," I wholeheartedly support Lords amendment 54, which prohibits the use of new maritime powers contained in schedule 6 in ways that would endanger life at sea"
5846,"The events in Ukraine in the past month have shown how quickly millions of lives can be thrown into chaos by war and  violence, and how individuals can find themselves dependent on asylum or sanctuary afforded by other countries"
5847," I also associate myself with Lords amendments 9, 52 and 53, which would remove from the Bill the Governments inhumane powers to make it easier to remove a person to a safe third country while their asylum claim is pending"
5848,"Does the Minister agree that amendment 6 is a huge slap in the face for all those people who play by the rules and engage in proper legal processes to get to this country, whether they are a refugee or not"
5849," Many amendments were passed in the other place, but for the sake of time, I will focus on Lords amendments 4, 9, 10 and 13"
5850, Clause 9 is one of the most chilling parts of the Bill
5851," Friend the Member for Aberavon Stephen Kinnock, and other Opposition Members, in Australia the offshore processing cost is estimated to be Aus $1 billion a year to deal with 300 migrants"
5852," The truth is that even once claims have been processed and around 40% have been found not to be valid, people rarely leave because of a combination of irresponsible activists, fatcat lawyers and the Human Rights Act, which needs to be ditched as soon as possible"
5853," Let us remember that 89% of Iranian asylum seekers  have their claims granted, 97% of Eritreans, and 96% of Sudanese, none of whom have a legal route"
5854," Lord Kirkhopes amendment 9 strips out the Governments plans to create an offshore asylumprocessing system, and I believe he is right"
5855, Australia ended up spending over £1 million per person detained offshorearound £4
5856,"3 billion for 3,127 asylum seekers"
5857, Members that there are 84 million refugees globally
5858," Millions have been displaced because of conflict and persecution and are seeking safe passage, including Syrian Kurds, Afghans and Yemenis, who have suffered the worlds worst humanitarian crisis 20 million are in need of humanitarian aid"
5859," However, the Home Office data confirms that 87% of those arriving by small boats in 2021 comprised nationals from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen, for whom there is currently no alternative legal and safe route by which they can apply to get to the UK, so it is pointless the Minister saying that he believes in accessible routes"
5860,It seems that amendment 7 goes to the heart of what we are talking about today
5861," That is why I rise today to support amendments 4 to 9, especially amendment 6"
5862," There is no such thing as an illegal refugee in international law, yet that is exactly what the new group 2 category attempts to establish"
5863," However, the Government are scrapping humanitarian protection as we know it and aligning it instead with the new group 2 status, meaning regular visa reviews every two and a half years compared with every five, no recourse to public funds, no right to work, restricted family visa rights and no route to indefinite leave to remain"
5864, Clause 11 is out of tune with the hundreds of thousands of people who have come forward to help Ukrainian refugees
5865," Gentleman reflect for a moment on the fact that there are 1 million refugees in Bangladesh, many hundreds of thousands in Uganda and over 1 million in Poland Many countries around the world, which are very poor and have very little infrastructure, have taken in far more refugees than any European country"
5866," Members that we will continue to uphold our international obligations and ensure that any removal is compliant with our obligations under the refugee convention and article 3 of the European convention on human rights, which protects against torture and inhuman and degrading treatment"
5867," There were 1,131 refugees resettled in the UK through that scheme in the year ending December 2021"
5868," We have granted over 40,000 refugee family reunion visas since 2015, of which more than half were granted to children"
5869," In 2021, there were 6,134 family reunion visas issued, which was an increase of 28% on the previous year"
5870," Again, more than half were issued to children"
5872," Even with a cap on the number of individuals, we can expect many thousands of applications, which UK caseworkers would need to assess individually to determine whether each individual belongs to the specific group found to be at risk"
5873," During its reign of terror, Daesh raped, murdered or sold into sexual slavery thousands of women, and sent young boys to its terrorist training camps"
5874," Let us not forget that 70% of the individuals who are currently making that channel crossing are men, predominantly single men in their 20s and 30s"
5875," The number of desperate asylum seekers risking their lives by crossing the channel on small boats has increased from 299 in 2018 to an eyewatering 28,526 in 2021, of whom more than 3,000 were children"
5876," Gentleman is referring to offshoring, but as we have seen, offshoring does not work it is costing millions and millions in Australia and every expert is panning the idea"
5877," We therefore support Lords amendment 54, which adds language to schedule 6, stating that these enforcement powers must never put lives at risk"
5878," We therefore support Lords amendment 5, which would add a new clause stating that nothing in the Bill must authorise policies which do not comply with the refugee convention"
5879, We currently have thousands of Afghan refugees stuck in hotels
5880," The Lords amendment would also prevent asylum seekers from being forced into the dangerous net of the blackmarket economy just to survive, which is so often more attractive to them than relying on £38 per week from the Government"
5881," We are pleased to see that more than 66 Conservative parliamentarians, including 27 members of this House, have signed a letter to the Home Secretary expressing support for Lords amendment 7, and we encourage Ministers to see the light and follow suit"
5882," Of the 8,593 notices of intent to deem people inadmissible that were issued in 2021, incredibly, only 64 were upheld"
5883," This policy simply increases the enormous backlog further and is a complete waste of money, so we support Lords amendment 8"
5884," The latest ludicrous suggestion is that Ascension Island, 4,500 miles away in the South Atlantic, should be used for the purpose"
5885," This is why the Labour Party supports Lords amendment 9, which removes offshoring from the Bill"
5886," It is still too vague, and we will be pushing Lords amendment 4 to a vote"
5887," The Government know it as well, which is why they cannot even accept Lords amendment 5, a simple amendment that would require powers in part 2 to be exercised in accordance with the refugee convention"
5888," So Lords amendment 6, which deletes clause 11, must be left in place"
5889," So we support Lords amendments 9, 52 and 53"
5890," If that is not enough, perhaps Members should consider the billions of pounds such a system will cost, while achieving nothing"
5891," As I have said a million times in the House, once that funding is in place the hon"
5892," Offshoring is going to cost billions of pounds, there is no sensible argument in favour of it and we need to get rid of it as soon as we can"
5893, Lords amendment 7 is a simple but powerful example
5894, We therefore pay tribute to all the campaigners behind Lords amendment 7
5895," Unless that can be fixed, we continue to believe that Lords amendment 4 is the best solution"
5896," Can he outline what that means in practice Is it just reimbursing the legal costs, or will we have a more sophisticated scheme Certainly, my constituent Tom Brown, who paid back £84,000 that he did not need to pay, is £84,000 out of pocket"
5897, Friend for all the work that she has done on behalf of her constituent Tracy Felstead and the 554 other postmasters
5898," On where we are with the compensation, I can announce that as of 11 March, 45% of people in the historical shortfall scheme had already received offers"
5899," That amounts to 1,067 individuals"
5900, The Post Office reports that it is firmly on track to make 95% of initial offers by the end of the year
5901,"That is the last question, so I will say that although the last three quarters of an hour have been my moment in the sun, it is not about me it is about the 555"
5902," They begged and borrowed £70,000 from friends and families to fill a shortfall that they could not understand, but which we now knowand the Post Office probably knew at the timewas not a shortfall at all"
5903, 1684
5904," Indeed, a YouGov poll showed that 81% of people who were asked agreed with the principle of allowing asylum seekers the right to work"
5905," Member for Hayes and Harlington John McDonnell mentioned a figure of £200 million, and the potential revenue is certainly in the hundreds of millions"
5906," When we put on the other side of the balance the fact that asylum accommodation costs £350 million a year, we can start to see why the numbers add up"
5907," There are 324,963 signatures to a petition about clause 9, and I pay tribute to all those who have campaigned on it"
5908, We will be voting for Lords amendment 4 today
5909," In my constituency, I have two detention centres, which house nearly 1,000 people"
5910," There are 1,700 asylum seekers in hotels in my constituency as well"
5911, They are told to live off £5
5912," All Lords amendment 7 said was, Just allow these people to workallow them to support themselves and their families, and to give something back to this country"
5913, At least £200 million would be put into our economy
5914," There is an argument that allowing employment will somehow add to the pull factor, but having to live off £5"
5915,40 a day is not the sort of pull factor that will attract millions to this country
5916, That is why Lords amendment 7 needs to be looked at more rationally
5917," Members to contemplate that, to look at Lords amendment 7, and to think again"
5918," In 2019, 2"
5919,245 million visitors came to the island of Ireland and spent £589 million
5920, There has been a 90% increase in the number of visitors to the island of Ireland from North America and 60% of all visitors to the island spend nights in both the Republic and the north of Ireland
5921," There are tens of thousands of movements each day on the island of Ireland involving Northern Ireland citizensfor the purposes of work or education, for example, and because people living in one part of the island may have business in the other jurisdiction"
5922," The quickest route from Dublin to Donegal is through Northern Ireland on the A5, and even someone making a very localised journey from Clones or Cavan town, for example, will cross the border four times in the course of that short journey"
5923, This contrasts with the hundreds of children who have been put in hotels and forced to share rooms and even beds with adult men they do not know
5924," Last year, 43% of victims referred to the national referral mechanism were children, with 31% of them being British, and the rise in county lines gangs is believed to be one of the biggest drivers of the rise in child referrals"
5925," If the Minister is not minded to strike part 5 from the Bill and work with the sector and us on genuine alternatives, he must protect children from the worst of the changes, which only put barriers between victims and the support and justice they need and deserve"
5926," In fact, in Committee during our discussions on part 5 alone the Minister referred to the statutory guidance a staggering 51 times when it is still to be published, which I must say made a mockery of parliamentary scrutiny"
5927," Given that 48% of victims of modern slavery in the UK last year were criminally exploited, that suggests that clause 62 has the potential to exclude almost half of all victims from support"
5928," 83F, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 1"
5929,"Recently, I was sent hundreds of Valentine cards from pupils at St Dunstans Primary School in my constituency, to my surprise; it is more than I have ever received"
5930," The situation in Ukraine is driving millions from their homes, many of whom have found refuge in neighbouring countries"
5931," Clause 11, concerning illegal entry into the UK, will criminalise those who do not arrive by regular routes, which for millions of refugees are simply not available"
5932, Will he publish an economic impact assessment on how many billions of pounds this will cost the taxpayer It has been promised for months
5933,"With the leave of the House, we will take motions 4, 5 and 6 together"
5934,"Motion made, and Question put, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 9"
5935," Ladys record of Conservative interventions that are somewhat supportive, is not what she has just said about that 48% the answer to the question I posed to my hon"
5936," Friend the Minister Under the Bill as presented, the Home Office will be required to intervene in half the cases to make the very difficult judgment whether to exclude or not exclude"
5937," I think I have less than a minute and a half, so I will be brief"
5938,"Motion made, and Question put, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 4"
5939,"I rise to thank the Government sincerely for amendment 1, the Chagos nationality amendment"
5940," They have suffered an injustice of approximately half a century and the Government today have gone a significant way towards ensuring that those people who are descendants of British subjects rightly have the ability to apply for British overseas territories citizenship, and therefore ultimately British citizenship if they so wish"
5941,"Mr Speaker, may I begin by joining in, on behalf of the Home Office, your tribute to PC Keith Palmer, who lost his life five years ago today All of us who were in the House will never forget that day"
5942," The Home Office confirms that 87% of the 28,000 arriving illicitly in 2021 came from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen, for whom there is currently no alternative legal and safe route to which they can apply to get to the United Kingdom"
5943," Much more sensible is to recruit and train several hundred new civil servants to process these claims more rapidly and, yes, to crack down on an overlengthy appeals process exploited through unscrupulous lawyers"
5944,"The east midlands freeport will see nearly £9 billion of new investment, and tens of thousands of new jobs created in our region"
5946," As someone who over the years has worked alongside the Met and seen at first hand the incredible things that they are capable of achieving, I know there are thousands of officers, staff and volunteers across the organisation who perform their duties with skill, professionalism and pride every day"
5947, Lady raised in the first half of her remarks will be addressed by Her Majestys inspectorate as it looks at vetting procedures across the whole country
5948," As someone who, like me, has an intimate knowledge of policing, I am sure he will acknowledge that there will be thousands of police officers up and down the land who are as disappointed and distressed by the revelations today as we are"
5949," They, and millions of Londoners, deserve leadership in the Met that they can trust and have confidence in, not leaders who have indifference to the risks of corruption"
5950,"A freeport in Wales, especially in Anglesey, sounds like a great idea, just like in Teesside, where the UKs largest and first postBrexit freeport has already led to the announcement of thousands of future jobs in new green technologies"
5951,2 Any further Message from the Lords may be considered forthwith without any Question being put
5952,1 Proceedings on consideration of Lords Amendments shall so far as not previously concluded be brought to a conclusion one hour after their commencement
5953,I thank the Minister on behalf of residents for his answer and for the UK Governments interest
5954,"The UK Government are committed to supporting the development of the floating offshore  wind industry in Wales, with £160 million of funding available for floating offshore wind ports and factories across the UK"
5955," Friend says, Channel 5 is 25 years old this month"
5956," Friend join me in celebrating Channel 5s team who had the imagination and confidence to do that then, and the current team who continue to bring understandable, relevant, and relatable news to people in all parts of the UK today"
5957,The A2
5958," Lady slightly, I believe the threshold will still rise by £300 in April, as was the Governments original plan"
5959,"I beg to move amendment 1, page 1, line 8, leave out July and insert April"
5960," Friends powerful representations on behalf of Blackpool, particularly with the levellingup agenda in mind"
5961," In its wisdom, it intends to split the A2 and M2 into two separate twolane highways midway between the A227 and Marling Cross"
5962," The outer two lanes will be for M2 traffic going down deeper into Kent; the inner two lanes will be for the A2 to Strood and the lower Thames crossing, and the Hoo peninsula"
5963," Not only will it cause dangerous weaving and accidents while the traffic tries to get into the correct lane, but the A2 will be narrowed to two lanes, which is completely inadequate for traffic heading towards the M2 at peak periods"
5964," In 2009, Highways England actually widened the A2 at  this point from three lanes to four lanes to cope with increased volumes, and now the proposal is to narrow it to two lanes"
5965, The cost of the project for central Government has increased from £3
5966,72 billion in 2016 to £8
5967,2 billion now
5968," We make these throwaway comments about billions, but imagine having a stack of a million £1 coins and then creating 8,200 stacks of £1 coins"
5969,4
5970," But in 2013, the costbenefit analysis supported the Dartford option and was against a crossing east of Gravesend, which then apparently provided a benefit of 1"
5971," Anyway, at a new cost of £8 billion, any benefit must now be marginal at best"
5972," I can completely understand why that might not matter too much to Kent and Essex County Councils, because it is not money from their budgets, but it is the money of hundreds of millions of people who will remain sitting snarled in their cars in traffic jams at Dartford over the coming decades"
5973,2 billion and does not represent value for money for taxpayers
5974, Spending £8
5975,2 billion to build that white elephant will not address the current problems at Dartford
5976," There will still be oversized vehicles at red traffic lights, and hundreds of millions of people will still spend time stuck in traffic for the next three decades"
5977, When it does not address that problem and we have spent £8
5978,"2 billion on itI suspect the costs will go uppeople will rightly look at us and say, How on earth have you spent £8"
5979,"2 billion on a project that still means, on the very rare occasions when there is a catastrophic failure, that people end up having to sleep in IKEA That is a true fact once the congestion was so bad that nothing could move, IKEA opened its doors, and people slept in its beds and on its sofas"
5980," Friend the Member for Leeds West Rachel Reeves, whose windfall tax proposals would have helped those struggling to get by with a payment of up to £600 per household"
5981," The Chancellor and the Prime Minister had the opportunity to look at a number of policies, including a windfall tax on the energy companies, which would have offered up to £600 of muchneeded help"
5982, We are introducing a tax cut for a typical employee that is worth more than £330 in the year from July 2022
5983," Finally, we maintained the 8% higher rate of capital gains tax for landlords compared with the rate for other taxable gains"
5984,"I am wondering whether the Minister missed new clause 2, because she did not address the problem"
5985," People were being told yesterday that they should get an extra £330, but they will actually get less than half of that"
5986, What is the Government going to do about that The Treasury is clawing back several hundred million pounds from some of the poorest workers in the country
5987,"I rise to speak to amendment 1, tabled in my name and that of my hon"
5988,"25% increase in national insurance contribution payments without any protection through a higher taxfree allowance, and three months in which families will feel the full force of the Chancellors tax hike without any cushioning from the rising of the national insurance threshold"
5989, Mr Usmanov is clearly laughing at this Government; he has moved hundreds of millions of pounds into irrevocable trusts
5990,"I warmly congratulate Channel 5 on turning 25, along with Channel 4 on turning 40 and, of course, one of our greatest institutions, the BBC, which is celebrating its centenary in 2022"
5991, While the Government have been playing games with the future of the BBC and Channel 4and we welcome the extra funding for the World Servicetheir journalists have risked their lives to report the facts on the front line in Ukraine
5992," Will the Secretary of State give an assurance that any future ownership decisions that she makes on Channel 4 will ensure that its indepth, independent journalism will be protected beyond 2022"
5993,What recent assessment her Department has made of the contribution of Channel 5 to public service broadcasting
5994,"I congratulate Channel 5 on its 25th anniversary, and I was delighted to attend the parliamentary reception this week to celebrate that significant milestone"
5995," Channel 5 has played an important and awardwinning role in our public service broadcasting system, through its provision of new programming, and its unique focus on childrens television"
5996,"As I have said a number of times at the Dispatch Box, a decision has not yet been reached on the future of Channel 4"
5997," Lottery distributors are providing £22 million to help communities become involved, and there will be a series of events between 2 and 6 June, including a special Trooping the Colour event and a service of thanksgiving at St Pauls cathedral"
5998," The busy A2, which runs through the centre of my constituency, is the main road link to the existing crossing at Dartford  that is the problematic one we have heard aboutand the proposed crossing to the east of Gravesend"
5999,"I wish first to address amendment 1, which was tabled by the hon"
6000, Member for Bath Wera Hobhouse and would bring forward to 6 April the increase to the primary threshold that is introduced in clause 1
6001," Of course the Government want to help people with the cost of living as quickly as possible, which is why the Chancellor introduced a number of measures immediately, including the cutting of fuel duty, which came into force at 6 pm last night"
6002," Its delivery to an April timeline would see millions of individuals paying the incorrect amount of NICs at the start of the tax year, in just two weeks time"
6003, That will avoid millions of taxpayers having to make manual claims for refunds
6004," On the points that Members made about poverty, if we look back at the past 10 years, we see that around 1"
6005,"3 million fewer people are living in poverty, half a million fewer children are growing up in workless households and hundreds of thousands fewer children are living in poverty"
6006," He announced the first tax cut on his journey to cut taxationthe cutting of the taper rate, which will put £1,000 into the pockets of those on universal credit"
6007," They will have seen the £1 billion household support fund, which is helping people in all our constituencies, building on other measures that were announced at the autumn Budget"
6008," More recently, we have provided £9 billion in energy support"
6009," I reiterate that the changes that we have already made mean that those who are on universal credit will benefit by £1,000 from the cut to the taper rate"
6010,I want to speak to new clause 2
6011," As I pointed out to him in an intervention, there is an anomalyI hope it is onethat the Government will want to put right when those on universal credit who pay national insurance have their threshold raised to £12,500, the £330 that they gain as a consequence will be subject to the 55% taper"
6012," He announced a number of measures that increased the incomes of the poor, although we should remember that he took away the £20 a week uprating of universal credit"
6013, How can that be The poorest workers in the country number 2
6014,3 million; I suspect that what the Government  claw back from them will mean hundreds of millions going back to the Treasury
6015," By my calculationI will stand corrected if I am wrongsuch people will gain £330, of which they will lose £171, so the actual gain will be in the region of £159"
6016, Subsection 2 aims to find out how much the Government will gain from some of the poorest workers in the country because of the changes
6017, I note that the changes to the threshold for selfemployed peoples class 4 contributions take effect in two stages
6018," First, the lower profits limit is raised from £9,880 to £11,908 from April 2022, and then it is raised again to £12,570 in April 2023"
6019," The figure of £11,908 represents, as far as I can tell, a blended average for 202223 of the lower profits limit continuing at the level previously intended until July, and then being raised to £12,570 for the remaining months of the year"
6020," As with class 1 contributions, we will therefore have three months during which the Chancellors NI hike will be in place and hitting peoples pockets, yet the changes to the threshold will not yet have taken effect"
6021, This clause also enables the Treasury to make sure that selfemployed people with profits between the small profit threshold and the lower profits limit will continue to be able to build up NI credits but will not pay any class 2 national insurance contributions
6022," I would like, however, to press the Minister on two technical points that arise from clause 3"
6023," First, why are the changes to class 2 contributions to be made by way of regulations, rather than being implemented through this Bill I note that clause 53 seems to make it clear that regulations arising from clause 3 will, as they would amend Acts of Parliament, have to be laid before and approved by a resolution of each House"
6024," Will the Minister explain why the detail on clause 3 will therefore be decided a later stage, and not with the class 1 and class 4 changes today Secondly, clause 32b makes it clear that the changes to class 2 contributions may be made to have retrospective provision from 6 April 2022"
6025,1 billion and add to their distress right in the middle of the biggest cost of living crisis since the 1950s
6026, A nurse or a midwife on an average salary will see their tax bill rise by £310 next year
6027, A care home worker will pay around £140 more and ambulance staff will see a £420 increase
6028," The typical family will see a hit of £1,100 next year, according to the Resolution Foundation"
6029, Absolute poverty is set to rise by 1
6030,"3 million people, including 500,000 children"
6031," That is why the Chancellor should implement the changes in the Bill not from July, but from April, as that would save working families £2"
6032,1 billion in tax payments
6033, It would require the Government to produce a report to look at the impact of the 1
6034,25% increase in national insurance contributions on disposable incomes
6035,75%
6036," I wish to speak against amendment 1, in the name of the hon"
6037," Member for North East Fife Wendy Chamberlain, and against new clause 1, in the name of the right hon"
6038, Amendment 1 is simply impractical
6039,6% increase in the national living wage
6040,2 million people across the country
6041,"1 challenge facing my constituency is access to quality healthcare, which, as a former nurse and social worker, I understand acutely"
6042,"I tabled new clause 1 because, from now on, I do not think that the House should discuss any legislation that has financial consequences without it understanding or at least having information about the effect on poverty and low pay"
6043," At the moment, 4"
6044,3 million children and 2 million pensioners in the UK live in poverty
6045," Overall, 14 million people live in poverty, and that was before the cost of living crisis hit us"
6046," According to analysis today from the Resolution Foundation, 1"
6047,3 million more people will be living in poverty
6048," Child poverty is already up by more than 500,000 since 2010, and it is interesting to note that most of those childrenmore than 60%live in households in which one adult works"
6049,"1% will drag more than 400,000 more people into poverty, and as we have pointed out time and again during the debate, inflation is forecast to rise over the year to between 7% and 10%"
6050, A total of 4
6051,8 million workers earn less than the UK real living wage of £9
6052,"90 an hour, or £11"
6053, The rise in the minimum wage this yeara 6% rise to £9
6054,"50 still falls short of the Living Wage Foundations real living wage, and, given that forecast of an inflation rate between 7% and 10%, it is a realterms pay cut"
6055,2 per cent in 202223their largest financial year fall on record
6056," According to the IFS, public sector pay has fallen by 3% in real terms in the last year, and is 2% lower in real terms than it was 12 years ago"
6057," The Department for Educations average pay offer to teachers is 4%, and the fact that inflation is so much higher has obviously hit their wage levels"
6058,I do not want the Minister to miss the point of new clause 1
6059," Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell Chris Grayling, the then Transport Secretary, opted for Kent and Essexs preferred option, which will do nothing to ameliorate the situation at Dartford and will be yet another massive piece of Government spending on road infrastructure just at the moment in our history when roads are to be optimised by level 5 autonomous vehicles"
6060," The way I think of it is that if we look across the rooftops of London we see thousands of chimneys, none of them used any more"
6061, The lefthand one is 4
6063," They are the cause of the horrendous jams, because no fuel tankers or hazardous loads are permitted unescorted, and no vehicles over 5 metres high are permitted at all"
6064," Not only will Dartford be gridlocked, but so will Gravesend and the whole of the A2 eastbound from M25 junction 2"
6065," Some 42% of vehicles using the Dartford crossing are now goods vehicles, which has gone up from 33% in 2019"
6066,"3 miles of new road linking the M2A2, A13 and M25"
6067," By almost doubling road capacity across the River Thames east of London, it will cut traffic using the Dartford crossing by 22%, and will provide national road freight with a reliable new connection"
6068,5 million vehicles away from Dartford every year
6069,I would also like to extend my gratitude on behalf of the Department to Councillor Bob Lane for his engagement
6070," The tunnel itself has been lengthened by around 1 km, and the route has been lowered or hidden behind earth bunds"
6071," Now, around 50% of the route in Gravesham is in the tunnel and 80% of the entire route is hidden from view, either in tunnels or cuttings or behind earth bunds"
6072," Some improvements may well come from building a lower Thames crossing as proposed, because it will move some vehicles awayI cannot remember the current figure; I think it is about 22% of existing usebut the existing crossing will still be above design capacity"
6073," It is very costly, as we have heard, at £8"
6074,2 billion
6075," Friend the Member for Gravesham described his 8,200 towers of 1 million coins very aptly"
6076," The commitment one will have to make to the new crossing, as it is so far away from the existing crossing, means that thousands of vehicles will be beyond the point of no return, and my hon"
6077, Friend described junction 2of the A2 or the M2
6078," Will we actually need this capacity where it is proposed, or should we be having a rethink If this project goes ahead there are opportunities for businessesindeed, if any small businesses in Thurrock, Essex, Kent or Gravesham are not aware of this, there is a supply chain school, and large tier 1 contractors are looking for local businesses to help them deliver this"
6079," We will still get congestion at the existing Dartford crossing for all the reasons we have heard, and we will be back here trying to find a solution, having spent £8"
6080,"2 billion on something that might benefit those who want to get from Dover to Cambridge, but will not benefit those who want to get from Gravesham to Thurrock"
6081,3 miles of new roadbut there is an impact from that road on the communities that it will cut through
6082," There is no train link, for example, yet HS1 travels between Kent and Essex"
6083," Cabotage limits can add up to £16,000 a day"
6084," Those are substantial burdens, and most tours of UK orchestras are to Europe such tours represent 12% of their earned income"
6085," We have sanctioned more than 1,000 individuals and entities; there were 65 more announcements today"
6086," Friend was there on Channel 5s opening night, and so were the Spice Girls"
6087," Channel 5 does a huge amount for independent production companies, and one fifth of all its commissioning spending goes to those smaller companies"
6088," That is a larger spend than the BBC, Channel 4 and ITV"
6089,"On behalf of the numerous immunosuppressed people in Chesterfield and their families who have contacted me, I thank my hon"
6090, Somebody who I know and have been to football with over many years has not been to a game for two and a half years
6091," For example, provisions in the Act have helped the courts and tribunal system to keep functioning throughout the pandemic by allowing thousands of hearings to take place remotely"
6092, The Ministry of Justices spending review settlement has put £500 million into addressing the issue
6093," Since the Act was first introduced, we have made huge progress in our fight against the virus thanks to a national vaccination programme that has now put more than 140 million doses in arms"
6094," To be clear, sections 53 to 55 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 enable thousands of hearings to be conducted onlinecurrently around 11,000 per weekso that courts and tribunals can be reserved for hearings, such as trials, that must be heard in court"
6095,"I, too, put on record my enormous thanks to all the health and social care workers as well as the many unpaid carerswho have demonstrated extraordinary public service over the last couple of years, and also on a daily basis, day in day outfor the instances of love, care and medical attention for the thousands of people who have recovered, but also the 165,000 who did not"
6096, I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to the two motions before the House today on behalf of Her Majestys loyal Opposition
6097, It has certainly not gone anywhere for the 1
6098,"5 million people who are living with the symptoms of long covid, or the 800,000 clinically vulnerable and immunosuppressed people who continue to call on the Government for better clarity and access to antiviral and retroviral treatment"
6099," Almost 15,000 nurses, midwives and, in England, nursing associates joined these temporary registers to help deal with the impact of the pandemic, as well as more than 10,000 paramedics, operating department practitioners and other professionals, and about 6,500 social workers"
6100,7 million jobs
6101," We have also supported the selfemployment income support scheme, which paid out more than £28 billion to nearly 3 million selfemployed people and was one of the most generous schemes for the selfemployed in the world"
6102, We made 5 million doses of antivirals available for the immunosuppressed
6103," There are still more than 2 billion people who are unvaccinated, and that will accelerate the risk of new variants that may be even more lethal"
6104, Statutory sick pay currently sits at just £96
6105, The 2 million lowpaid workers who earn less than the lower earnings limit of £120 receive nothing
6106,Motions 3 and 4 will be debated together
6107," So what will stop him making serious mistakes like that again when he exercises his new check and oversight powers in, potentially, hundreds more cases Labour wants victims to have the right to make a new personal statement saying how they would feel if the prisoner is released"
6108,5% of reported rape cases ever make it to court
6109," Those that do now take more than 1,000 days, on average, before the trial startsthese are the longest delays in British legal history"
6110," It is striking that, as of last year, only 5% of all Parole Board panel members come from a law enforcement background"
6111, 1 thing in the Ockenden review that came out was that staffing shortfalls can make a difference
6112, A recent CQC survey shows that almost a quarter of women were unable to get help when they needed it during labour
6113," Does he recognise that the Ockenden review has raised fundamental questions for maternity services across the NHS over the culture of socalled normal birth, and that a focus on targets, under successive Governments, rather than on patient outcomes, can distort clinical best practice and, tragically, patient safety Following his discussion with the trusts current chief executive, which he has mentioned, is he satisfied that the current management and clinical teams have accepted the local actions for learning recommendations in the initial Ockenden report, and are committed to studying and rapidly implementing all further recommendations specific to the trust Finally, what reassurance can he give the thousands of expectant mothers in Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin that the maternity services there are safe, and that patient safety is paramount"
6114," It looks at the experiences of almost 1,500 families from 2000 to 2019"
6115," In 12 cases where a mother died, the report concludes that in three quarters of them, the care could have been significantly improved"
6116," That includes providing £95 million for maternity services across England to boost the maternity workforce and to fund programmes for training, development and leadership"
6117," Just a few days ago, the NHS announced a £127 million funding boost for maternity services across England"
6118, I can tell the House that the trust has implemented all the actions set out in the interim report; that was backed at the time by £95 million in extra funding
6119," As I said a moment ago, the final report quite rightly makes many more recommendations, which have all been accepted and which are backed by funding of at least £127 million, much of which will go to workforce"
6120," Lady will have heard me talk about the £95 million given at the time of the interim report, plus the £127 million given for maternity services in the past few days"
6121," Hundreds of thousands of births are delivered through the NHS each year, and the vast majority are completely safe, as I myself have found and as many other Members have found, including my hon"
6122, We have thousands of midwives marching on the streets
6123, The Department has sneaked out the view that restricting contributions to the cap for those being meanstested for their care charges would save an estimated £900 million by 202728 in cash terms
6124," If the calculation towards the cap is to be changed, that change must come the same way, through crossparty working with the sector, patients and people involved, understanding the evidence on impact and considering the consequencesnot through this halfarsed addition to an NHS reorganisation, which is essentially what the Government are doing"
6125," If we are serious about providing governance that rules out the possibility of the private sector influencing the expenditure of public money, an organisation carrying out the functions of an ICB on its behalf should be a statutory NHS body"
6126," Before the pandemic, adult hospices on average received 34% of their funding from Government, with some receiving little or none"
6127," Hospice funding came primarily from charitable donations, with the sector needing to raise £3"
6128,1 million every day
6129, That is a direct transfer of £900 million from household wealth to somewhere else
6130," It also true to say that most people will not be affected, because only people on very long care journeys tend to be affected badly,  but there are quite a few of them according to the Departments own figures, about 6,000 a year10 people per constituencywould be affected in this way, and most of them have dementia"
6131," We know that there are 900,000 people with dementia in the UK today; according to the Alzheimers Society, there will be 1"
6132,"6 million by 2040; and 70% of care home residents are dementia sufferers, and they are the sort of people who will suffer because of the changes"
6133," The research provided by the Alzheimers Society is clear under the Dilnot proposals, about 50% of people living with dementia benefited fully from the care capthey reached the care cap"
6134," Only 13% of people in the least wealthy quintile will reach the cap, whereas 28% of the most wealthy will"
6135, That £900 million has been found from people with less wealth
6136, Look at how different regions are affected only 13% of people in the northeast reach the cap whereas 29% of people in the southeast do so
6137," Previously, in almost every part of the country, about 50% of people did so"
6138," First, it is a really terrible way to come up with policy to change a policy halfway through a Bill, because it starves important policies of public debate and parliamentary scrutiny"
6139," Lords amendments 1, 25, 27 and 49 strengthen our approach to mental health"
6140," As the House knows, this Government are committed to tackling health inequalities, and Lords amendments 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 24, 31, 32, 38, 39 and 41 take us further in tackling disparities and levelling up opportunity and outcomes across the country"
6141," Lords amendments 9, 18, 33 and 40 place duties on NHS trusts, foundation trusts, ICBs and NHS England to have regard to the Governments key ambitions on climate change and the natural environment in everything they do"
6142," Unlike schedule 3 to the Care Act 2014, this duty applies to all carers where the patient has care and support needs following discharge; and it applies to young carers as well as adults"
6143," We want to end unpredictable care costs for everyone by introducing a universal £86,000 cap on an individuals personal care costs"
6144," It would be fairer to keep to the original Dilnot proposals, but can the Minister outline how the £900 million saving that, it is estimated, will result from the Governments proposals and the use of meanstesting will better protect those with lowervalue properties"
6145," I have the witness statements of more than 2,000 people who suffered with mental health problems during the pandemic and who wrote to me detailing what that was like"
6146,"5 million carers supporting a loved one who may be older, disabled or seriously ill"
6147, It is an enormous contribution and saves the health and social care system billions of pounds a year
6148," Friend the Member for South West Surrey Jeremy Hunt, £6"
6149,2 billion was spent on locums in the financial year 201920 to plug the gaps
6150," That means 7,500 more medical schools training places in England over the past six years"
6151," The shadow Health Secretary is obviously right to say that the population has grown in recent decades, but I think it has grown by 8% since 2010, while the number of doctors working in our NHS is up by about one third"
6152,I draw the Ministers attention to the 2 million Uyghurs who have been detained in concentration camps
6153," The Government are rejecting the amendment because they think it would compel them to train more doctors, which is true, but it ignores the fact that this is the best way to reduce the £6"
6154,2 billion locum bill that is currently devastating the NHS budget
6155," Why is there this reluctance to publish the number of doctors we are going to need in 15 years time, given that 97% of hospital bosses say that staff shortages are having an impact on the quality of care they are giving and there are 110,000 vacancies The answer is simple it is because the Government know we are not training enough right now"
6156," This is why it is supported by more than 100 health organisations; every royal college and every health think tank; people in all parts of this House; many peers in the other place, including Lord Stevens, who used to run the NHS; andthis is the point I wish to conclude withby thousands of thousands of doctors and nurses on the frontline"
6157," On Lords amendment 29, does the shadow Minister acknowledge that Macmillan Cancer Support said that it needs an additional 3,371 cancer nurse specialists That would double the nurses by 2030, and it gives us a reason why we need to support Lords amendment 29 and why workforce safety is critical"
6158," I have referred to Macmillan and their request for an additional 3,371 cancer nurse specialists to help address that issue"
6159," Lords amendment 56 clarifies that the powers in part 3 of the Bill in respect of special health authorities apply in relation only to England and crossborder special health authorities, and not Walesonly special health authorities"
6160, The monthly workforce statistics for December 2021 show that there are more than 1
6161,2 million fulltime equivalent staff
6162," In that context, I highlight the decision made, I believe, under one of my predecessors to expand the number of medical school places from 6,000 to 7,500, which has come on stream"
6163," He and I have discussed the significant increase in percentage terms in the number of radiographers, radiologists and others since 2010, but I acknowledge his underlying point that there is more to do if we are to achieve the ambitions set out in our consultation on the 10year cancer plan and our broader ambitions for cancer care and treatment"
6164," Instead, it is in the unenviable position of having to deal with those ongoing challenges at the same time as trying to address the significant backlog that existed before we went into  the pandemic, when a record 4"
6165,5 million people were already on NHS waiting lists
6166, Six million people are now waiting for NHS treatmentthe longest waiting lists on recordand they are waiting longer than ever before
6167," The Health Secretary has admitted that the Government will not meet their manifesto commitment to recruit the 6,000 GPs we need to get people seen on time and we know that many cases will simply present in overstretched accident and emergency departments"
6168," It hopes that ignorance is bliss and that we can carry on as we are, and perhaps nobody will noticeeven the 6 million people on NHS waiting lists"
6169," After the scandal of billions in taxpayers money being handed out to mates for duff PPE and testing contracts, and PPE literally going up in smokealong with taxpayers moneywe hope that this is the start of Ministers looking again at where they went wrong during the pandemic"
6170, The £1
6171,"1 billion given to Wales for test and trace was a Barnett consequential, but we spent only half of that, £533 million, because we used public sector procurement and production effectively"
6172," There are 93,000 NHS staff vacancies; £6 billionplus has been spent on temporary staff to fill gaps; and more than half of staff are working unpaid extra hours each week, with 44% saying that they have felt ill with workrelated issueslittle wonder, given that retention remains a huge issue"
6173, One survey shows that public satisfaction ratings with the NHS are reported to be at a 25year lowa quarter of a century of surveys thereand another shows that the number of NHS staff who would recommend their trust as a place to work has plummeted

6179," Does that impact assessment then mean we cannot do that because we do not want to lose £20 millionor £20 billion or whatever it happens to bebecause that is too expensive, and that we will on balance therefore purchase from a known slave labour provider Is that what we are saying Is that what the impact assessment will say to us I say to those who call for an impact assessment be careful what you call for"

6181," For example, wealthier people who entirely selffund their own residential care are likely to have to spend £86,000 of their own money if they live in a residential home for just over three years"

6188," Over half the VIP suppliers provided PPE that the Department of Health and Social Care considers unsuitable for frontline services; in addition, some 1"
6189,5 billion items of PPE are currently in storage and expected to expire before they can be distributed
6190,"The Minister talks about value for money, yet we know that the Government handed hundreds of millions of pounds of our money to an offshore company involving a Tory peer, created just days before and without any transparency, that sold Government PPE at three times the price it had bought it for"
6191," The Government succeeded in getting domestic production, excluding gloves, up from 1% to 70%"
6192," Gentleman refers to 50% of suppliers having something faulty all that means is that in a shipment that may have been of tonnes of PPE, one item was faulty"
6193, It does not mean that 50% of the items received were faulty
6194," There is around £250 billionworth of public procurement and around £50 billionworth of central Government public procurement, and I am extremely keen that SMEs in Northern Ireland are able to get visibility of that pipeline, so that we can tap into the talent and entrepreneurial spirit of which the hon"

6209, This is just one example where it has been made clear that HS2 is being constructed with a complete lack of consideration for the environments it is destroying and people it is impacting
6210, It seems that HS2 Ltd and its contractors are doing neither
6211," Just before Christmas, HS2 Ltd presented some of my constituents with the gift of a notice of entry declaring that it would be entering their homes to install movement monitoring apparatus"
6212, I am sure Members can imagine how distressing it was when my constituents were then unable to contact HS2 Ltd for weeks to understand what that meant in practice
6213," HS2 Ltd is failing to communicate transparently, exacerbating the already strained relationship with communities, who feel they are having this project imposed on them"
6214," HS2 Ltd is treating its interactions with people and the environment like a tickbox exercise, doing no more than meeting minimum requirements"
6215," The debates cannot be the same without him, but as you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, we have urged on behalf of the Committee that the summer recess Adjournment debate be titled the Sir David Amess Adjournment debate"
6216," Member for Gateshead Ian Mearns, was taken unwell this morning, so on behalf of the Committee I would like to say to the hon"

6220," The Governments resettlement scheme for Afghans has placed more than 6,000 people and continues to be supportive, but he was right to make that point"

6257," We now have PAS 9980, which will not replace EWS1, but could the Minister say that from his perspective he would rather people look at PAS 9980, as opposed to EWS1"
6258,"I must draw the Houses attention to the fact that financial privilege is engaged by Lords amendments 6, 17, 22 to 30, 103, 104, 111 to 113, 116, 120 to 127, 137 and 138"
6259, Lords amendment 1 addresses a concern with clause 10
6260, Lords amendments 2 to 4 and 48 are minor and technical in nature
6261," The salary of an immigration tribunal judgea firsttier tribunal judgeis £117,000"
6262," If we put on oncosts, even most generously we get £200,000"
6263," So far, £120 million has been committed to the Rwanda scheme; around 600 firsttier tribunal judges could be bought for that, or any number of hundreds of Home Office caseworkers"
6264," Right now, the average percentage of victims who engage with investigations is not 89%, but 33%"
6265, Lords amendment 9 exempts from the prohibition on relocation those relocation subsidies that have the effect of reducing social or economic disadvantage
6266,"I would like to use my three minutes, which have not come up on the clock yet, to focus on Lords amendment 6B"
6267," The Bill would further expand the number of people without access to public funds such as welfare benefits and housing assistance, and thereby ensure that thousands more refugees a year fleeing war and persecution are at increased risk of falling into destitution and homelessness once they have reached the UK"
6268, I urge all Members to support Lords amendment 6B to ensure that refugees living in the UK are not forced into poverty and destitution
6269, An estimated 80 million people are displaced by conflicts and instability around the world
6270," For nearly 20 years, it has been possible under UK law to remove individuals from the UK while their asylum claim is pending if a certificate is issued under schedule 3 of the Asylum and Immigration Treatment of Claimants, etc Act 2004"
6271, At an annual cost of around £1
6272,"5 billion, it is the highest in more than two decades"
6273," Every day, the cost of the broken system on hotels alone is nearly £5 million"
6274, I shall be quick and focus on Lords amendment 7
6275, Friend accept that Lords amendments 7B  and 7C have been qualified to make the proper concession that people seeking asylum should not be given preferential treatment to those who already have refugee status and that there is a builtin review period I and others have said on many occasions that there is simply no evidence to suggest that a limited right to work is a pull factor
6276," It will not tackle the 12,000long queue of Afghan refugees loyal to Britain who are currently languishing in hotels, alongside a further 25,000 asylum seekers, at an eyewatering cost to the British taxpayer of £4"
6277,7 million daily
6278," It is caused by this Home Secretary, on whose watch we have seen a staggering 60% drop in processed claims"
6279," Contrasting that with the £11,000 that it costs to process an asylum seeker here in the UK, we start to see the impact on the public purse"
6280, Then there is the £120 million in development aid
6281," There can be absolutely no doubt that the Governments claim that Rwanda is a safe country for refugees will be challenged in the courts given that thousands of Rwandans seek asylum in Europe every year, with 76 Rwandan citizens granted asylum here in the UK since 2017"
6282," Labour Members have continually made the case that the Bill must meet Britains obligations under the 1951 UN refugee convention, and we are supporting Lords amendment 5B, which secures this"
6283," First, we support  Lords amendment 6B, which seeks to ensure that all refugees are given their convention rights and that family unity is maintained, even if the Government are determined to introduce the utterly inappropriate differential treatment aspect of this Bill, which, shamefully, contravenes the UN convention"
6284," For example, only 13% of land in the UK is owned by womenin other words, 87% is owned by menand boys are twice as likely as girls to inherit family businesses"
6285, Friend always raises pertinent issues on behalf of his constituents in Winchester
6286," If a leaseholder property is valued at less than £175,000, or £325,000 in London, the leaseholder will pay nothing and, if the leaseholder has already met interim costs that exceed the contributions cap, they will pay nothing"
6287," The Government originally proposed that leaseholders contributions be capped at £10,000, or £15,000 in Greater London, and we believe that creates a fair balance"
6288," We are therefore restoring the caps at £10,000 outside London and £15,000 in London, as originally proposed, and have made a small number of other technical improvements to those measures"
6289,"As I understand it, the difficulty is that a claim would need to be made on behalf of leaseholders by their landlord, who would insist on indemnity funding"
6290," However, we recognise that any subsidy regime must provide sufficient transparency and accountability for the spending of billions of pounds of public money each year"
6291," As of today, DP World is still a partner in the London Gateway freeport and is potentially set to benefit from £25 millionworth of public funding"
6292,5 million threshold for subsidies to services of public economic interest were far too high
6293," Lords amendments 26 to 30 and 32 lower the threshold for publishing subsidies to services of public economic interest to £100,000"
6294," In Committee, Labour tabled new clause 3, which would have given the CMA the power to investigate subsidies that may be of concern and subsidy schemes on its own initiative"
6295," I am therefore pleased that the Lords tabled Lords amendment 9, which removes the relocation prohibition on subsidies that work to reduce social and economic disadvantages"
6296," It reduces the threshold for subsidies to be included in the transparency database from £500,000 to £100,000"
6297," The threshold of £500,000 was too high for us to have a good enough overview, and that is without mentioning peoples inability to challenge subsidies if they do not know they exist"
6298," Setting the threshold at £100,000 makes it much less likely that a company will be badly damaged by a harmful subsidy that it is unable to challenge because of the lack of transparency"
6299," Schedule 2 contains a lot of commonsense principles already, which support the UKs priorities on net zero and protecting the environment"
6300, I am massively concerned that net zero is included only in schedule 2 and not in schedule 1
6301," If the Government are not prepared to come to any kind of compromise with the House of Lords, would it not be even better for all these powers to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament, so that the people of Scotland could build the kind of humane immigration and asylum system that hundreds of constituents in Glasgow North have lobbied me to advocate for in this House"
6302," She needs to hire more caseworkers and invest in the court system, so that we can process applications quickly and dramatically reduce the ludicrous £4"
6303,7 million a day that is being wasted on housing refugees in expensive hotels
6304,"Motion made, and Question put, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 5B"
6305,"Motion made, and Question put, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 8B"
6306," Since then, thousands of leaseholders have been forced to live with the anxiety of being in unsafe buildings through no fault of their own"
6307," On the point about the building cost thresholds, he will know that the London median house price is £515,000, but in Runnymede and Weybridge it is £475,000"
6308," There is a general welcome for the Governments attempts to take a more proportionate approach and for moving away, albeit over a period of time, from EWS1 forms to PAS 9980, which can cover whole blocks rather than individual properties"
6309," The two questions that the Select Committee has not had answers  to are, first, whether the Government will look at making the building regulator responsible for deciding which blocks need this new assessment rather than the building owners, who might have a particular interest in saying no; and, secondly, whether he will ensure that the professional indemnity insurance scheme also applies to assessors on the PAS 9980 assessments as well as to those on the EWS1 forms"
6310," That was going to solve everything, but obviously it was not, even when the Chancellor stood up and offered in his Budget the £1 billion building safety fund and said that was going to give everything the Select Committee had asked for, which it was not and did not"
6311, The National Housing Federation has said that up to £10 billion could be needed to remediate social housing
6312," The G15 group of social housing landlords has said that, for their properties alone, it could be over £3 billion"
6313," Friend raised about what happens if leaseholders have already paid up to the £10,000 cap but there are further costs"
6314," What happens in those circumstances It would be scandalous if leaseholders who have already paid the £10,000, or £15,000 in London, were to suffer that for want of someone to pay the bill"
6315," As has been said, many of those people have been presented with eyewatering bills, such as £250,000 or more, to fix fire safety issues that are definitely not their fault, are clearly the responsibility of the developer in the first place and should have been put right since"
6316," It cannot be fair, or in keeping with natural justice, that in some cases the single determinant of whether someone has to pay £10,000 or £15,000and someone else does notis the arbitrary fact of whether the Government can find another party to carry the can"
6317," The valuation of properties could leave one flat liable for £10,000 or even £15,000, while an identical flat in the same block could be exempt"
6318," Of course, I was not nearly as cynical as the leaseholders who were facing bills for tens of thousands of pounds and were wondering whether the issue would just be kicked down the road and into the long grass"
6319," Member for Sheffield South East Mr Betts, who said that if a building were 1 cm lower than it needed to be, that could be the most expensive centimetre in history"
6320, Leaseholders in buildings above 18 metres are already protected by the Governments £5
6321,1 billion building safety fund for the removal of unsafe cladding
6322," Assessments carried out in accordance with the new PAS 9980 principles should produce more proportionate responses than costly and, ultimately, unnecessary remediation"
6323, The Government have been clear in their view that an EWS1 form should not be required for buildings below 18 metres in height
6324," Given the small number of buildings involved, a blanket legislative intervention bringing hundreds of thousands more buildings into scope to deal with an issue affecting just a handful of buildings would be entirely disproportionate"
6325, Enfranchised buildings are eligible for the £5
6326,1 billion building safety fund in the same way as other buildings
6327," Gentleman is right that it would not be appropriate for me to speak on behalf of the Welsh Government, and I do not think they would like that either"
6328, Social housing providers will not be subject to provisions that stipulate that building owners and landlords with a net worth of more than £2 million per inscope building must pay all inscope remediation costs
6329," Friend the Member for Worthing West Sir Peter Bottomley, let me say that we are retrospectively extending the limitation period under section 1 of the Defective Premises Act"
6330," Mandale House, in my constituency, faces a range of problems, and has secured £3"
6331,4 million from the building safety fund towards the necessary remediation
6332," However, that falls short of what is needed, and Mandale House is left with £7"
6333,4 million to find in order to complete the work
6334," Six years later, those responsible were fined more than £300,000 because their fire protection work had been clearly inadequate"
6335," I am not talking about people who live in big, expensive, multimillionpound apartments looking out over the Thames"
6336,"May I suggest that it would be a good idea if the Government had a roundtable with the insurers about what informal provision they are making in case there are successful actions, and about whether they would like voluntarily to contribute, say, £4 billion to £5 billion No residential leaseholder would then carry the cost, and the insurance company would know that it would not be chased with legal claims that were likely to succeed"
6337," Leaseholders can still have to pay up to £15,000 if funds cannot be recovered from the developer or freeholder, and leaseholders in buildings under 11 metres are entirely excluded"
6338, Large sections of the Bill have been completely rewritten on the basis of hundreds of Government amendments tabled in the other place that the noble Lords had relatively little time to consider carefully or properly scrutinise
6339," Lords amendment 6 specified fourfire suppression systems, the safety of stairways and ramps, the certification of electrical equipment, and provision for people with disabilitiesand we supported it"
6340," Having maintained in the other place that the amendment was entirely unnecessary, the Government yesterday tabled an amendment in lieu of Lords amendment 6 that almost entirely mirrors its provisions"
6341, 1508
6342, 1509
6343," Four and a half years after Grenfell, the Bill needs to be amended to reflect and deal with this issue"
6344," As it stands, buildings held in trust on behalf of a thirdparty investor,  where the landlord is a professional depository or custodian regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, or buildings owned on trust by what I can only describe as ground rent grazersalmost invariably based offshoredo not meet any of the association tests or the net wealth test in the Bill"
6345," Unless the Bill is revised to capture such trustee arrangements, they will escape the socalled waterfall system as set out in schedule 8, and the leaseholders will find themselves picking up a proportion of the costs of noncladding remediation"
6346," Although we fully acknowledge that the waterfall system now set out in schedule 8 provides leaseholders with a far greater degree of protection than the Bill as originally drafted proposed, it does not protect them fully"
6347, I want to represent the leaseholders in Monument Court in my constituency who at the momentI will speak to the Minister about thisare being sent bills by Higgins Homes for 50% of costs
6348," They are already getting £10 million from the building safety fund, and they need to find £5 million from leaseholders"
6349," In my constituency, leaseholders who are affected would not pay a single penny, because the Secretary of State gave a commitment from the Dispatch Box in a previous debate that waking watch costs that had already been paid over the past five yearsextended to 10 years, which we are very pleased about and did not even ask forwould contribute towards the £10,000"
6350," Up and down the country millions of leaseholders have won, but we must turn that victory into reality"
6351," As we know, at the moment millions of them are trapped"
6352," Because we know that the most that any leaseholder will ever paytechnically, in theoryis £10,000, we have created value again in every single one of those properties"
6353," We have got the market moving again, because everybody knows that they will not have to face what in the case of Vista Tower is a remediation bill of £180,000 or £200,000 on a £180,000 flat"
6354," Indeed, a recent survey by End our Cladding Scandal of more than 2,200 properties and buildings over 11 metres tall shows that more than 64% of leaseholders outside London and more than 83% of leaseholders in London will not be protected from the costs of noncladding fire safety defects"
6355," Leaseholders in buildings that are under 11 metres remain unprotected, and there is still no funding commitment from house builders for the £4 billion required for the remediation of buildings where the developer no longer exists"
6356," First, in place of the higher transparency thresholds that applied to subsidies given under a published scheme, and given as minimal financial assistance or services of public economic interest assistance, we have introduced a single upload threshold of £100,000, which now applies to all subsidies that are subject to the transparency requirements"
6357," This represents a substantial 80% reduction from the original threshold of £500,000 for subsidies given under the schemes"
6358," On insurance, which has been my bugbear as well, it is not just that many of the insurance companies insured the development beforehand, and therefore provided a warranty of sorts, but that since then they have increased premiums on leaseholders, sometimes by more than 1,000%"
6359," There is an important distinction between companies or businesses with which the Government may be working to achieve policy objectives, and their eligibility still to receive public subsidies, potentially to the tune of hundreds of thousands of pounds or millions, where they have explicitly even admitted to this House that they have broken employment law"
6360,"With less than 2% of the Conservative parliamentary party in the Chamber, it must be beyond debate that the Prime Minister will be investigated by the Privileges Committee"
6361," More seriously, it is also coming at a cost to the publics faith in political leadership, such as it is, except, I am pleased to say, in Scotland, where Scottish Tory votersincluding in my Angus constituencyneeded to take only one look at this Prime Minister for Tory seats in Scotland to fall by 55% at the 2019 election"
6362, He is a disgrace to the office of Prime Minister and an insult to the millions of the electorate who played by the book
6363," Is it not important that we have this inquiry now to understand whether that has happened and there has been a repeated offence against the House   In the past year, half of the public have lost what little trust they had in politicians"
6364," On the point about repeated offences and forgiveness, I would encourage her to look at Romans 7"
6365," 10 and showing complete contempt for his own rules, workingclass communities and young people in overcrowded flats all over Britain were in lockdown The mental health crisis that we still have around us was intensified by the very strict operation of those rules, and many young people faced massive £10,000 fines for organising parties"
6366," For context, in the same period the parties took place we were held to a strict oneparent bedside rule, and were only allowed to swap every 5 nights"
6367, The Prime Minister has to accept that this is not just a Westminster row that nobody outside SW1 is concerned about

6407," We enhance and work our relationship with Finland and Sweden through the joint expeditionary force, which is 11 nationsScandinavian and Nordic, and Britainworking together and exercising together in the defence world"

6411," Can that be confirmed as on the table today The measures must also include tougher action on Russian money laundering and include action by the Treasury to tackle the ongoing and improper use of Scottish limited partnerships, which have been used to funnel millions of pounds in dirty money"
6412," Do not forget, it is quite right to say that 41% of Russias GDP comes from oil and gas"
6413,Is this the wakeup call that NATO needs so that all its members finally meet their obligations to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defence
6414,"I remind the House that we do actually guarantee the sovereignty of Ukraine, having signed the Budapest memorandum in 1994, along with the United States and Russia, and I think later France, and even China"
6415," In 2014, the seizure of Crimea was discussed in the Security Council on seven occasions, I think"
6416," Is the Prime Minister not concerned, given the answer he just gave about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and the fact that discussions are still continuing about exclusion from the SWIFT system, that we are not demonstrating determined, united resolve at the very moment when we need the credible threat of strong sanctions to try and deter President Putin from invading Ukraine"
6417," That was the fantastic achievement of the end of the cold war, the fall of the Berlin wall, and that high moment in 1990 when we had a Europe whole and free"

6421," Friend knows, the Americans have sent about $650 millionworth of military assistance to Ukraine"
6422," I am sure he has read the 5,000word essay by Vladimir Putin about Ukraine and the origins of Russia"
6423, We already have a very wide package of sanctions in place since the Russian incursion of 2014
6424, I am afraid he is not right in what he says about abandoning Ukraine since 2014
6425," With Operation Orbital, the UK has been out there in the front, helping to train 21,000 Ukrainian troops since 2015"
6426, I have been saying for a very long time that the arguments that President Putin uses about Russian speakers in Ukraine are exactly the same as Adolf Hitler advanced over the Sudeten Germans in Czechoslovakia in the 1930s
6427, I am sure there will be other sanctions comingI do not quite understand why we have sanctioned only 25% of the people the  American Government have already sanctioned
6428,President Putin has not even waited for the gas to start flowing through the Nord Stream 2 pipeline before exploiting the stranglehold that he has been building on the German economy
6429,A percentage of our natural gas comes from Russia and Putin has already said that he will turn off the taps if he deems Moscow to be unfairly sanctioned by the west
6430," Could I ask him to take further action on energy, as I did during the Russian invasion of Crimea Alongside all the measures he rightly proposed in his statement, will he convene a summit of the G7 Energy Ministers, as we had back in 2014, to look at how we can improve shortterm and mediumterm energy security, protect consumers in this country and elsewhere against rocketing gas prices and give ourselves a much stronger hand in the face of Putins aggression"
6431," We have to be respectful of this, but the simple fact is that about 3% the UKs gas supplies come from Russia, whereas about 36% of German energy needs come from Russian gas"
6432," As I told the House just now, only 3% of our gas supplies come from Russia, but he is right about the spike in prices, which is why we are working together with President Biden and other colleagues to see what we can do to increase the supply of gas both to Europe and of course to this country"
6433," Actually, Russian gas comprises only 3% of the UKs gas supplies, but we have to mitigate the impact of the  cost of energy on families with the cold weather payments and everything that we are doing to increase the living wageall the support that we are giving families throughout the winter and beyond"
6434," But I reassure the House and the country that I and the whole Government are focused 100% on dealing with the peoples priorities, including the UKs leading role in protecting freedom around the world"
6435," Russia has, of course, already attacked Ukraine, illegally annexing 10,000 square miles of her territory in 2014 and igniting a war in the Donbass region"
6436," Last week, the UK acted to strengthen Ukraines ability to defend her soil by supplying antiarmour missiles and deploying a small training team of British personnel, in addition to the work of Operation Orbital, which, as the House will know, has trained 21,000 Ukrainian troops since 2015"
6437," Denmark is sending a frigate to the Baltic and deploying four F16s to Lithuania to join NATOs longstanding air policing mission; France has expressed its readiness to send troops to Romania under NATO command; and the United States has raised the alert level of 8,500 combat troops, preparing to deploy them in Europe at short notice"
6438," We cannot bargain away the vision of a Europe whole and free that emerged in those amazing years from 1989 to 1991, healing the division of our continent by the iron curtain"
6439," More than half of Europe, including a dozen or more members of NATO and of the European Union, would be only partially sovereign and required to seek the Kremlins approval before inviting any military personnel from NATO countries on to their soil"
6440," The Czech Republicat the very heart of Europe, hundreds of miles from Russiawould have to ask the Kremlin for permission if she wanted to invite a company of German infantry to join an exercise or even to help with flood defences"
6441," It is therefore important that we demonstrate that although Ukraine is not in NATO, we can do our best to protect its right to choose; and it is also important that we make it crystal clear to the President of Russia that if he tries this with NATO partners, no matter how big or small, article 5 is a reality"
6442,The President of the United States made it very clear that he will stop Nord Stream 2
6443," Friend specifically about sanctions Will the UK, when it presents its package, ensure that its sanctions are synchronised with those of the United States, that they include action to prevent UK banks from handling foreign currency transfers from Russian stateowned banks, and that they also include what I know our colleagues in the United States Senate would like to includespecific sanctions against Nord Stream 2"
6444," Yemen gets about 20% of its food from Ukrainian grain; for Libya, the figure is 44%"
6445," Will he comment on a specific loophole relating to where Russia gets its money from Under the International Monetary Funds special drawing rights, $650 billion was allocated to states around the world last year, and Russia got $17"
6446," That is done by our forces, and it is why we have made even more available, including 1,000 members of the Army currently on standby in the UK to send elsewhere"
6447," The purpose of that extra £24 billion was to modernise our armed forces, and also to ensure that we are able to enter new domains where we are threatened by both Russia and other adversaries"
6448," We also fully support moves to reinforce the security of NATO allies, as the Labour leader and I told the Secretary General at NATO headquarters earlier this month"
6449,"What will the Government do to try to impress on President Putin that even if he invades the rest of Ukraine without military comeback on behalf of Ukraine, it would be a fatal error for him to think that he could then invade an outlying NATO stateone of the Baltic states, for examplewithout an attack on one rightly being considered to be an attack on all NATO members"
6450," Although I accept that NATOs potential for direct intervention is limited due to article 5, what planning is there for a possible crossborder refugee and humanitarian catastrophe"
6451," Does he want to apologise for that remark, which was not only crass, but undermined efforts to deliver Minsk II as the starting point for our best chance of avoiding war Does he accept that if the Government are serious about playing a constructive role, they should start by getting their own house in orderfirst of all by repaying the almost £2 million that his party has received in Russian donations since the Prime Minister took office Will he finally end Londons role in hiding the proceeds of Kremlinconnected corruption"
6452," However, Russian aggression against Ukraine threatens the strategic supply of food around the world, because Ukraine is the third biggest exporter of grain, at 100 million tonnes a year, so what assessment has he made of the areas of the world that are most likely to be affected if aggression should lead to that food not being available Does he not agree that that underlines the strategic importance of Ukraine and the importance of giving it every bit of support to allow it to defend its independence, democracy and vital economic role"
6453," If 1 million refugees appear in Hungary, Romania or Poland, I would urge the EU to step up and think about what it is going to do about millions of refugees on its soil rather than think about it afterwards"
6454," Gentlemans behalf, to engage with the National Crime Agency to see what more we can do"
6455, The British Government are continually exhorting our European friends to exceed the 2% threshold
6456," It would be a great thing if we could get some of them up to 2%, never mind 3%"
6457," I think there are about 1,100 currently still in Ukraine, and there is a helpline that people should ring"
6458, It is 01908 516666
6459," I am expecting to run this statement until around 2 oclock, so short questions and pithy answers would certainly be helpful"
6460, Friend accept that too many NATO Governments and political parties have accepted energy  dependence on Putin and financial dependence on dodgy donations from Russian oligarchs Given that we spent between 4
6461,"5% and 5% of GDP on defence throughout the 1980s until the end of the cold war, will he now accept 3% of GDP on defence as a suitable future benchmark"
6462," We must shore up that country, and that is why I announced a further $500 million of support today from the UK Government"
6463, I echo his welcoming of Chancellor Scholzs brave decision today to freeze Nord Stream 2
6464," Given the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the fact that we have now entered a new era in the battle for democracy globally, will he now consider a substantial and sustained increase in defence spending, well above the 2"
6465,"4% that is required to ensure stability and peace in our time Jawjaw, if indeed there is room for it in future, will be more effective with stronger armed forces"
6466," If the worst happens, a European nation of 44 million men, women and children would become the target of a fullscale war of aggression waged, without a shred of justification, for the absurd and even mystical reasons that Putin described last night"
6467, We will now guarantee up to $500 million of Development Bank financing
6468," Gentlemans point about visas, we are stopping tier 1 visas from Russia"
6469," We have put another 1,000 troops on standby, and this country will continue to do what it has always done and receive those who are fleeing in fear of persecution"
6470, We should work with our European allies to ensure that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is cancelled
6471," Friend go back to the EU and NATO, in particular, and say that we have to raise our spending budgets to at least 3% to have more planes, more ships and more men to deter Russia and not to wage war, but to prevent one from happening"
6472,"Ukraine has been experiencing conflict since 2014, which has created a crisis of 2"
6473,9 million people in need
6474," Promsvyazbank is a top 10 Russian bank, which services 70% of state contracts signed by the Russian Ministry of Defence, but the measures we have prepared are much tougher still, and we will have absolutely no hesitation in implementing them"
6475," There is a G7 meeting straight after this statement, and we will be holding meetings in NATO, in the P5 and in every forum where it is relevant and possible to bring President Putin to understand the gravity of what he is doing"
6477," In the UK, we are in the fortunate position of having only 3% of our gas coming from Russia, but other European countries have learned that they have much more to do"
6478," By the way, I salute the decision of the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to cancel Nord Stream 2"
6479," Friends point about defence spending, actually we are up at 2"
6480,4% of GDPI think that is one of the highest figures in NATOand we are the second biggest contributor and military power in NATO already
6481,"We have seen a 10% increase in defence spending in this country, and we will sustain that increase in defence spending"
6482," As he knows, in Poland we have increased our support with another 350 Royal Marines from 45 Commando, and in Estonia we have doubled our presence in Tapa to 2,000"
6483," He asked about support for Ukraine; as I mentioned in the House, we have given £100 millionworth of support particularly for Ukraines energy crisis and also for other economic needs, plus the further $500 million I announced just now"
6484," We must understand that and be prepared for it, which is why we are investing massively in cyberpreparedness, with another £2"
6485,6 billion to help fortify our defences
6486,"According to expert legal advice I have seen, there are serious flaws in the new sanctions regime it may not affect oligarchs close to Putin who do not hold an official position in a company or who own less than 50% of shares; it is too narrow in defining the individuals it covers; unlike US legislation, it is limited in how we can sanction Russian Government officials; and the definition of Government of Russia excludes the legislative branch, including the Duma"
6487," Can the Minister give us an update on the membership action plan, the prelude to NATO membership When Poland joined in 1999, we were told it was a step too far; when Romania joined NATO in 2004, we were told it was a step too far"
6488,"We stand firm in our support for Ukraines NATO membership aspirations, in line with the 2008 Bucharest summit declaration, in which NATO allies agreed that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance"
6489," Will the Minister set out very clearly that the article 5 protection of our NATO allies in the Baltic states stands firm and will be unquestionable, and that Britain will not renege on our enhanced forward presence, which is protecting the Baltic states from any Russian aggression"
6490, The UK position on Nord Stream 2 has not changed
6491," We have repeatedly aired our concerns about the construction of Nord Stream 2, which would undermine European security by allowing Russia to tighten its grip on those nations that rely on its gas"
6492," Nord Stream 2 would divert supplies away from Ukraine, and the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine is regarded as a deterrent against further Russian aggression, so it is a vital part of Ukraines national security"
6493," We cracked down on illicit finance through the groundbreaking legislation introduced in 2017, the Criminal Finances Act, and we published our economic crime plan in 2019"
6494," We remain willing to engage in consultations, as provided for under that memorandum, as we did back in March 2014 in Paris after Russias illegal annexation of Crimea"
6495," When Iran was excluded from the SWIFT system in 2012, it required an EU regulation to make SWIFT do that, because SWIFT is incorporated under Belgian law"
6496,"We have continually voiced our concerns about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and we will continue to do so"
6497, We have heard alreadywe have not had an answerthat the SWIFT payment system and Nord Stream 2 must be on the table
6498," Friend support a strengthening of our £23 million counterdisinformation and development aid package to Ukraine, which can help Ukrainians to discern fact from Russian fiction on social media"
6499," Gentleman for the wisdom and the statesmanship with which he has just spoken On his points, we have put 1,000 troops on standby to help with the humanitarian exodus in the adjacent countries, and we have people in forward presence in the adjacent countries to help UK nationals come out"
6500," Gentleman is absolutely right to raise that appalling possibility, and it is vital that we reaffirm, again, that under article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty, we stand foursquare behind every one of our NATO allies and will come to their defence"
6501, We are investing massively in cyberprotectionI think we are putting in another £2
6502," In the past few years, we have tackled more than 3,000 cyberattacks It is a risk, but a risk, I am afraid, that we must run in the cause of freedom"
6503," The Prime Minister has some very important meetings, and I will be running the statement to 6"
6504," This must include ending Europes collective dependence on Russian oil and gas that has served to empower Putin for too long, so I welcome again Chancellor Scholzs excellent decision to halt the certification of Nord Stream 2"
6505," With around half of Russias trade currently in US dollars and sterling, I am pleased to tell the House that the United States is taking similar measures"
6506," So far today, Russian stocks are down by as much as 45%, wiping $250 billion from their value in the biggest oneday decline on record"
6507," Sberbank, Russias biggest lender, is down by as much as 45% and Gazprom down by as much as 39%, while the rouble has plummeted to record lows against the dollar"
6508," Our undersea cables carry more than 95% of western military, diplomatic, commercial, financial and personal communications, and the consequences of these cables being weaponised is terrifying"
6509,"Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland triggered article 4 of the north Atlantic treaty today, and I heard that we will be joining those discussions"
6510, That is why on Tuesday I announced the $500 million extra package of development aid on top of the £100 million that we have already given
6511," Today, thousands of Russians are protesting in citiesagainst their domestic lawabout this awful war"
6512," May I ask him to look wider than simply the Russian people, and at all those who are enabling Putins economythose who sit on boards of the businesses that finance him, whether they are former Chancellors of Germany, or former Prime Ministers of France Will he look here, close to home, at those who enable and propagate the propaganda that is used by Putin to undermine his own people and free people everywhere Will he update the Treason Act 1351, so that we can identify those people and call them what they are traitors When the Prime Minister speaks to people around the world, will he   speak with the truth that he can in Russian through the BBC Russian service, and start to broadcast in languages other than Russian into Russia, so that all Russian peoples can know that their oppression does not need to exist and they do not need to side with the tyrant"
6513,"As well as being incredibly ruthless, President Putin is incredibly rich, with one assessment saying that his personal wealth is up to $200 billion"
6514," The world must isolate Russia like the rogue state it is, including the statebacked oil giant Rosneft, which is 20% owned by BP"
6515," In this new era, the permissive environment that we created for the Kremlins quartermasters to live, invest and party in London, sometimes with the Prime Minister himself, must now come to an endInterruption"
6516, We are lucky in this country in that only 3% of our gas comes from Russia
6517,  He has hundreds of billions of foreign currency reserves and a military that has been tested
6518," Around 300 civil service roles have already moved or are moving to the city, in addition to the 2,790 civil servants already based in York"
6519,"Yes, and what is so encouraging is that the whole House understands the vital importance of that article 5 guarantee that we make to every one of the 30 members of NATO"
6520," So what steps are the Government taking to prepare for the humanitarian issue Will the 1,000 troops on standby to help with humanitarian assistance now be deployed"
6521,"I would like to state, on behalf of the people of Norwich, our solidarity with the people of Ukraine"
6522,The US ambassador addressed the UN a few days ago to say that up to 5 million refugees may be coming out of Ukraine and into the rest of Europe
6523," Member for Hastings and Rye SallyAnn Hart, Sky News is reporting that over 1,000 brave soulsRussian soulswere arrested last night across 54 cities while protesting against the shedding of both young Russian and Ukrainian blood, as the Minister has pointed out"
6524," Does Britain support NATOs response force now being activated in full What further contribution will the UK make to reinforcing NATO allies on the eastern flank, and when will the 1,000 UK troops on standby to help with humanitarian assistance be deployed The Minister also mentioned the doubling up of British forces in Estonia"
6525, The Antonov2 airfield north of Kyiv was taken by Russian airborne forces as part of the initial assault yesterday morning but was reportedly retaken by the Ukrainian forces overnight
6526, They report that 137 Ukrainian service personnel have been killed in action as well as 57 civilians; hundreds more have been injured
6527," Those doubledup force levels will  remain indefinitely and will be augmented by the headquarters of 12 Mechanised Brigade, meaning that the United Kingdom will have an armoured brigade in Estonia, reassuring one of our closest NATO allies"
6528," We need to have our eyes wide open to the reality that in such an event NATO jets would, not just possibly but most certainly probably, come into a combat situation with Russian jets, and the risk of miscalculation, escalation and the triggering of article 5 could not be understated in those circumstances"
6529," As Members will appreciate, in the air domain the risk of miscalculation is greater, because things are happening at Mach 2 and there is no time for political calibration; it is in the hands of pilots who are flying at well over the speed of sound"
6530," I understand exactly why the Ukrainian ambassador is asking for this, but we need to be clear that it could well trigger an article 5 moment and we need to be cleareyed about that reality in considering it"
6531," The 1,000 troops that the right hon"
6532, Gentleman asked about when the enhanced forward presence battlegroups will have been doubled up and when the brigade headquarters will be in place
6533," There were some fantastic pictures yesterday of Challenger 2 tanks being loaded on to low loader trucks to be driven north through Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, and into Estonia"
6534," It is a testament not only to the Royal Welsh battlegroup but to the brigade headquarters, 3rd Division and the Field Army that that work has been completed so quickly; we expect them to be complete in Tapa by 1 March"
6535," As I said in response to the initial question about a nofly zone, when things are happening at Mach 2, and where border incursions can last for just seconds, often it is not heads of Government who get to make the decision about whether a trigger on an antiaircraft missile system is pulled"
6536," Lady a disservice, but I understood her question to be whether the 1,000 troops will go into Ukraine, as they went into Kabul in the summer, to facilitate the egress of Ukrainians"
6537," The 1,000 troops who are on standby are there to support Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Poland with the expected humanitarian challenges they will face as people make their way out of Ukraine"
6538," It is absolutely essential that the diplomatic effort, even if it requires a bit of patience, brings with us the whole of the western alliance, because if Putin wants one thing more than the territorial gains in Ukraine, it is to see NATO fracture and article 5 no longer mean anything"
6539," Friend, his constituents and the service people who live in his constituency should be enormously proud of what the members of 12th Brigade, headquartered in Bulford and with many living in Tidworth, are doing in Estonia today"
6540," President Putin wants not just territorial gain, but the fracture of the western alliance and for NATO and article 5 to become meaningless"
6541,"I want to voice condemnation of Mr Putin on behalf of the residents of Hastings and Rye, and their support of and prayers for the Ukrainians"
6542," Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup Mr French pointed out, this is an issue that overwhelmingly affects women and girls, with 80% of underage marriages in 2018 being undertaken by girls"
6543,"I, too, offer my prayers and support for the people of Ukraine on behalf of my Ynys Mn constituents"
6544, This outrage against international law is happening just two and a half flying hours from here
6545," Friend the Member for Wentworth and Dearne John Healey will the 1,000 UK troops that the Minister has placed on standby to help with the humanitarian crisis now urgently be deployed"
6546,"I am full of praise for the Government for now being able to sanction 1,000 individuals, but will the Minister confirm two things First, can he confirm that a large number of them can be sanctioned for only 56 days under our rules, because it depends on the Act that we passed yesterday Secondly, can he confirm that we will proceed with many more sanctions The tiny number of people around Putin may not be moved by all of this, but the people who have £750,000 tucked away here as their possible bolthole are terrified of what may happen, and we need to get to them as well"
6547," Friend aware of the £30,000 accepted by the Conservative party from the wife of a Putin ally, Lubov Chernukhin Let us be clear, in answer to the hon"
6548," I do not think we can say that about the Ministry of Defences procurement, which is known across Government to be ineffective and inefficientI need only mention the Ajax armoured vehicle to make the point that billions have been misallocated and spent inefficiently and ineffectively"
6549," Before we start talking about spending more, let us not forget that we are one of the biggest spenders on  armaments in the world, dwarfing Russiawe spend more than Russia every yearand that global spend on armaments is approaching $2"
6550,"5 trillion, which is 20 times larger than what we have pledged to spend on the climate crisis, the biggest existential threat facing humanity"
6551," Almost 3 million people have fled, the vast majority of them women and children, with little more than the clothes on their back"
6552," An investigation by openDemocracy in 2019 revealed that, in a decade of austerity, the Conservatives took £130 million in donations and 80% of their 2019 general election funding came  from the elite Leaders Group, with exclusive access granted to group members for a fee of £50,000"
6553," Overseas territories, British tax havens, are responsible for 29% of the £245 billion in global taxes that the world loses to corporate, according to the Tax Justice Network"

6556," We welcomed the delivery of more than 3,600 NLAW antitank weapons"
6557, Sergey Brilev regularly reports on the war in Ukraine for Rossiya 1 and always touts the Russian line
6558," He has a £700,000 flat in Chiswick and a British passport, as well as a Russian one"
6559," Why on earth is he not on the list Vladimir Solovyov, a 58yearold who is also on Rossiya 1, is on the EU list but not on the  UK one"
6561," I simply point out that Nigel Farage received £548,573 from Russia Today in 2018 alonethis is from the Russian state"
6562," I am sure that he would acknowledge, however, that whatever courage it took for him to make that rather unpopular contributionI dare say his contribution was possibly, in some respects, inaccurateit took a lot more moral courage for Maria Ovsyannikova to speak out as she did on Channel 1 Russian TV"
6563," He has been at the heart of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which my hon"
6564," I simply say what I have said all along, which is that if NATO overextends the guarantee of article 5 to the point at which it ceases to be credible that the major NATO countries would fight world war three to defend the country in question, it undermines the credibility of the guarantee as a whole"
6565," After today, we will have designated more than 1,000 individuals and entities under our Russian sanctions regime"
6566," We have led the way with our financial sanctions, targeting 10 Russian banks, and we have hit over £300 billion of Russian bank assets"
6567," We were the first European country to send defensive weapons; we have already donated more than 3,600 next generation light antitank weapons and are now supplying Javelin missiles"
6568, I am under no illusion that the incredibly brave defence and sacrifices being made by the Ukrainian people against Russian aggression and barbarism is nothing less than a sacrifice on our behalf
6569,"Up until that point, I was 110% with the hon"
6570," Friend the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said yesterday was that £350 was the payment to the host family or household"
6571," We have pledged almost £400 million, which includes the supply of more than 700,000 medical items directly to Ukraine and more than 500 power generators to keep essential facilities such as hospitals running"
6572," The Governments response has been late, halfhearted, partial and discriminatory"
6573," So many of them have opened their hearts and their purses, and now we hear that hundreds  of thousands have even offered to open their homes"
6574," Ukraine faces debt payments of $7 billion this year alone and, so far, there has been no offer of suspension or cancellation of debts"
6575," It is a Government of kleptocrats, representing the interests of the billionaire robber barons, with their palaces and yachts paid for with the wealth stolen from the Russian peopleso solidarity with those antiwar protesters"
6576,"The world and all of us across this House have watched in unity the horrors of recent weeks, as Ukrainian civilians and thousands of soldiers have been killed in this predicted and premeditated invasion"
6577,"5 million people, mainly women and children, to flee their country and face the prospect of many months of uncertainty in refugee camps across Europe"
6578," Despite the Prime Minister last week offering hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians sanctuary in the UK, the Government were shamefully forced to admit that only 1,000 people have been admitted and given refuge on our shores"
6579," Inexplicably, it was not even made public as tens of thousands of Ukrainians streamed across France in search of safe passage"
6580," It is completely unacceptable that already exhausted people, who have travelled hundreds of miles, women and children, are being asked to jump through multiple arduous and unrealistic hoops, while they wait nervously for weeks to find out whether they will be admitted"
6581," They used the Home Offices existing systems as a starting point, but they are simply not suitable in a period of war with almost 3 million refugees in three weeks"
6582,"Nobody could fail to be moved by the images of Ukraine that we have been seeing on our screens for days nowthe destruction, the death and the millions of refugees"
6583," None of us can know how long this conflict will last, but we do know that there is already a severe refugee crisis with the potential of literally millions of victims"
6584," The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says that there are still more than 9 million Iraqi refugees worldwide, yet there are currently only 20,000 in this country"
6585," According to him, its breakup was the greatest disaster of the 20th centurya revealing and curious choice when compared with the millions killed in two world wars, in the Russian civil war and in the forced collectivisations, the mass deportations and the hell of the Soviet gulag"
6586,"5 million refugees have fled Ukraine, with the United Nations estimating that the number will double by the end of this week, and what have this Government actually succeeded in doing They have created barrier after barrier and piled confusion on top of misery, using excuse after excuse and exploring any possible way in which they could avoid playing their full part in this European humanitarian crisis"
6587, The UK sold £15 billionworth of weapons to Saudi Arabia last yearthe very same weapons that are now being used to terrorise the Yemeni peopleand Britishmade bombs rain down on Palestine
6588,"We tend to forget Moldova, but it is always worth remembering that the poorest country in Europe has taken in a quarter of a million refugees"
6589, A quarter of a million Does not that make it doubly shameful that what we are told is one of the wealthiest countries in the world has so far done so little
6590," One hundred years ago, when Russia wanted to impose its will on the Ukrainian people, it enforced famine on Ukraine"
6591, It is in multimillion pound properties scattered across the City of London
6592,"With the leave of the House, I would like to conclude this debate on behalf of my hon"

6594, Bank assets worth over £350 billion have been frozen
6595," The artists, athletes and performers blocked from performing overseas and the hundreds of people queuing in recent days for their last McDonalds must be dismal signals to all Russians that Putin is damaging their country"
6596, It is the oppression of the freedom of hundreds of thousands of innocent people to feed the ego of one man
6597," It is imperative that we all bear in mind that this is not about the millions of ordinary Russian citizens, both those still in Russia and those here in the UK"
6598, The Polish community in this country is now almost 1 million strong
6599, Poland has taken in more than 1
6600,"5 million Ukrainian refugees, and the figure is rising all the time"
6601," That is why it is essential for Britain to take a lead in creating a Marshall plan to help countries such as Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova, which between them have taken more than 95% of all Ukrainian refugees"
6602," Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania have the comfort of being NATO partners, so we know we stand by them under article 5if the Russians cross that fence, both sides know what the ramifications will be for both sidesbut Moldova does not have that protection"
6603," The suffering of the Ukrainian people, of the Georgian people and of others, including Russians demonstrating on behalf of us all, must not go unrecognised"
6604," The Disasters Emergency Committees appeal has now reached over £150 million, which we are supporting with our largest ever matchfunding pledge of £25 million"
6605," At that time, natural gas exports from Russia to Germany amounted to 35% of Germanys annual consumption"
6606," Nord Stream 2 let alone Nord Stream 1bypasses Ukraine, so it remains one of the greatest strategic mistakes of our time, conceived all of 20 years ago or more"
6607," As I speak, Germany still depends on Russian oil and gas and Nord Stream 2 has only been paused, not yet completely abandoned"
6608," Levelling cities, forcing women and children in their millions to flee, lying and lying while watching ones own country and its citizens become impoverishedthat is not insanity; it is evil"
6609," This month marks eight years since  the beginning of the Saudiled war on Yemen, which has claimed more than a quarter of a million lives and pushed 20 million people to the brink of starvation"
6610," As experts have made clear, that war would not be possible without the Governments support and the £20 billionworth of arms that they have sold to the Saudi regime since it began"
6611," A huge percentage of the Russian population will still be with Putinwill believe what he is putting outbut hopefully the slow drip, drip, drip of resistance will eventually reach a  tipping point, and the grey suits in the Kremlin will tap him up and suggest, Time to go"
6612," They gave Ukraine the means to fight  back, and the training to help it, and some percentage of the success is down to what the Ministry of Defence in this country did to help our Ukrainian friends"
6613," Member for Haltemprice and Howden Mr Davis observed, that is £1 billion of assets that have left the United Kingdom"
6614," She has paid over 1,000 for visas, including for Valeria, an unaccompanied minor who turned 11 years old yesterday"
6615, I am offended on behalf of my constituents that they are struggling with the system
6616," Make no mistake, Ukrainians are fighting this war on behalf of all of us who are part of the free and democratic world"
6617, It is important that people recognise that the £350 some hon
6618," Members have mentioned will go to the householder, but more than £10,000 of support will be made available to local councils for those being homed in the UK"
6619," Friend the Defence Secretary two weeks ago, there was a commitment of 4,241 nextgeneration light antitank weaponsNLAWSwhich have been delivered"
6620," In Syria, 5 million people were internally displaced and 5 million people were outside in the surrounding countriesthat is 10 million people out of a population of 20 million"
6621," Sanctioning leads to asset freezes, so the Government will be left holding millions of poundsworth of houses, boats and other assets, but what happens next Will these assets be sequestrated and used for the benefit of Ukraines rebuilding, or will they be held to be returned to oligarchs after the war The latter option may not be so popular, but it might be legally correct if we do not legislate further on this matter"
6622," 1404, dated 8 December 2021, a copy of which was laid before this House on 13 December 2021, be approved"
6623," 4 Regulations 2022 SI, 2022, No"
6624," 5 Regulations 2022 SI, 2022, No"
6625," 6 Regulations 2022 SI, 2022, No"
6626,"Do we not need an update of the Treason Act A treason charge can be laid only in relation to the person of the monarch, and this Act from 1351 really does need updating"
6627, We should be working to support our allies in the EU to cancel Nord Stream 2
6628," We did not sanction Russias oil and gas supplies, which make up 70% of its exports"
6629," However, we should not forget that no gas is travelling down Nord Stream 2 now and that all the gas comes into Germany on Nord Stream 1"
6630," SberBank has roughly 36% of SMEsmall and mediumsized enterpriselending in Russia, with VTB having 20% of consumer loans"
6631," Although we do not want to do anything that would cause systemic risk to UK financial markets, we are talking in the billions of dollars here rather than in the trillions, and there are other ways of shoring up our system to prevent that happening"
6632," I am told that Putin has squirrelled away more than $250 billion around the world through his oligarchs; they are not actually wealthy individuals, but only nominally wealthy, because it is his money, which he has stolen from the Russian state"
6633," Last week, ITVs Peston show explained that £1"
6634,"5 billion of property in the UK has been bought by Russians accused of corruption or with Kremlin links, and nearly 30% of that is in Westminster"
6635," There are 2,100 UKregistered companies involved in Russian laundering and corruption cases, involving a staggering £82 billion"
6636," I am going to be a bit repetitive here, because it needs to be said again and again where is the economic crimes Bill Where is the reform to beneficial intereststrue ownership for offshore properties For heavens sake, is it really in our national interest to have tens of thousands of properties used and owned by offshore shell trusts, hiding organised crime or the worlds kleptocrats If the Government understand hybrid conflict, what are they doing to deal with this threat"
6637, The analysis of the Royal United Services Institute is that 60% of the measures in the plan have not been implemented
6638, It is a task we perform with our allies for the benefit of billions of people around the worldto take on the kleptosphere in new and aggressive ways
6639, Friend the Foreign Secretary announced that we will be increasing our support to Ukraine by £100 million
6640," As has been mentioned, £1"
6641,5 billionworth of property in the UK is owned by Russians who are connected to crime and corruption
6642," Some 50% of that is registered in overseas territories and Crown dependencies, the public registers of which are not supposed to go live until 2023"
6643," The Prime Minister himself said in his statement that, in a worstcase scenario, 44 million people could get pulled into a very aggressive war, which would mean a refugee crisis"
6644," Banks in Germany, Denmark and Sweden all laundered billions of pounds from Russia but they used UK shell companies to do so"
6645, Some £1
6646,"5 billion of UK property has been bought with suspicious Russian wealth, according to Transparency International, and that is just the tip of the iceberg"
6647," I do of course welcome the sanctions announced today, but Germanys first tranche of sanctions was Nord Stream 2"
6648," Up to this point, for the last two weeks, the narrative was about how we had done more than Germany, but this is round one in the boxing match Germany has brought Nord Stream 2, and we have brought five banks that do not really matter and three people whom the United States had already sanctioned"
6649," They must be a precursor to decisive action taken with our allies, because it is clear that Russian aggression will not dissolve in the face of what will equate to a parking fine for a millionaireirritating, but in no way lifechanging"
6650," Upon that acceptance, NATO troops could carry out NATO manoeuvres in Ukraine, support our allies against the aggression of Russia and protect the 44 million Ukrainians"
6651," I agree that the Germans have moved swiftly, as we know, to suspend Nord Stream 2I would like to see them end the whole idea of itbut if they are going to do more, we should be cooperating with them and going in hard ourselves this one time"
6652," Mr Putin has proven to be considerably better at salami slicing than we are, so now is not the time for half measures"
6653," It is not nothing, but it is not much, particularly when set against the actions of the German Government in announcing the icingthe cancellation perhaps, but the icing certainlyof the Nord Stream 2 project, a $10 billion project, which has huge implications for their energy security, and indeed ours, given the interconnectedness of the EU and the European energy markets"
6654, New legislation is unlikely to affect oligarchs close to Putin who do not hold an official position in a company and who own less than 50% of the shares
6655, It is not a time for halfmeasures or naivety as to President Putins intentions
6656," In this city of more than 7 million people, with at least a quarter of a million properties owned in London by foreign nationals, just three individuals have been named, when the EU has already indicated the naming of 27"
6657," We need to understand what these tier 1 visas did, and where the vulnerabilities are in the British economy"
6658," As it stands, paragraph 4 of the legislation would allow sanctions to be laid against individuals on the board of companies with certain links to the Russian Government but it would not enable sanctions to be laid against officials who enable the Russian Government to pursue their policy of aggression in Ukraine"
6659," Paragraph 7 of the legislation defines what is meant by the Government of Russia, but it does not include members of Russias legislative branch, the Federal Assembly"
6660," 2 Regulations 2021 SI, 2021, No"
6661," 1146, dated 11 October, a copy of which was laid before this House on 14 October, be approved"
6662, This includes the forced diversion of Ryanair flight FR4978 on 23 May in order to arrest the journalist Roman Protasevich and his partner Sofia Sapega
6663, Friend is 100% right
6664,"I welcome the sanctions that the Foreign Secretary has set out and her words about getting Putins dirty money out of UK finance, but can we also get it out of UK politics Would she support the Conservative partys handing back its £2 million from Russian oligarchs"
6665," Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber Ian Blackford has also raised the question of the £2"
6666,3 million of donations
6667, The rouble has fallen by more than 40% as a result
6668," As much as $250 billion has been wiped off the Russian stock market and, today, its stock market is closed"
6669," The EU, Germany, Sweden and others are following our lead in providing defensive weapons to Ukraine, and Germany has frozen Nord Stream 2"
6670," Friend the Prime Minister announced a further £40 million of  humanitarian aid, which will provide Ukrainians with access to basic necessities and vital medical supplies"
6671," The UK is also supporting Ukraines economy, including through £100 million of official development assistance and guarantees of up to $500 million in development bank loans"
6672," With over 50% of Russian trade denominated in dollars or sterling, our coordinated action with the United States will damage Russias ability to trade with the world, and as soon as this legislation comes into force, we will apply it to SberbankRussias largest bank"
6673," The same legislation will prevent the Russian state from raising debt here, and will isolate all Russian companiesmore than 3 million businessesfrom accessing UK capital markets"
6674, I am pleased to see Germany committing 2% of its GDP to NATO
6675," The rouble has crashed by over 40%, the main borrowing rate is up 20%, and inflation is reportedly hitting about 65% per year"
6676, Oligarchs are being frozen out of their bank accounts and the central bank of Russia is being blocked from part of the $640 billion war chest that it holds in foreign reserves
6677," We should remind everyone that the oligarchs are mostly in possession of Putins own personal fortune, which is in the order of $200 billion to $250 billion, squirrelled away through their accounts"
6678,We are already donating £40 million of additional humanitarian assistance to Ukraine
6679," This war is not on behalf of the Russian people; this war has been instigated by President Putin, and it is very important that we focus on the personal agency that he has had in mounting this unprovoked attack on Ukraine"
6680," Together with the G7, we represent half the global economy, and that is what will really shift Putins behaviour"
6681, The NS Challenger is due to berth at 6 am on Wednesday
6682, The UK gets only 3% of its energy from Russian oil and gas
6683," The figure for some countries is as high as 90% or 100%; we have to reduce that over time, and that is what we are working on through the G7"
6684,"This sanctions package has been agreed across the G7, which represents more than 50% of the global economy"
6685," Surely we should at least be cutting the Russian embassy here by a half or three quarters, if not deciding that the ambassador, who has lied through his teeth to this House, should go back home"
6686," On the specifics of the Foreign Secretarys statement, she said that over 50% of Russian trade is denominated in dollars or sterling, but so that the House can understand the impact of our Governments actions, how much of Russian trade is denominated in sterling"
6687," From the 1990s onwards, Britishheadquartered legal, finance, audit and risk companies have helped to create the kleptocracy that exists in Russia"
6688," The point that I was making is that the action that we have taken on clearing is in conjunction with the United States, so between us we are able to cover 50% of that trade"
6689," We will be making sure that there is a process by which people can apply, but there is clearly a ceiling in the first year of 5,000 and then it goes up to 20,000 over the next few years"
6690," Has he noticed that the Chinese Government, since our departure from Afghanistan, have used Afghanistan to up their threats on Taiwan, with hundreds of overflights threatening the Taiwanese and telling them that, when the war comes, the US will not be there to support them Could my right hon"
6691, It was America that supplied 98% of the air power98% of the munitions dropped were from the US
6692, Friend; I believe he speaks for millions of peoplequiet peopleup and down this country
6693," Nor is it correct to say that the initial budget of 5,000 for the resettlement scheme has already been filled"
6694," In addition to the extra £3 million that we have invested in mental health support through NHS Op Courage, we are providing another £5 million to assist the military charities that do such magnificent work, with the aim of ensuring that no veterans request for help will go unanswered"
6695," Even before the onset of Operation Pitting, we had brought around 2,000 to the UK between June and Augustand our obligation lives on"
6696," We have already doubled the UKs humanitarian and development assistance to £286 million this year, including funds to help people in the region"
6697," If anyone is still tempted to say that we have achieved nothing in that country in 20 years, tell them that our armed forces and those of our allies enabled 3"
6698,6 million girls to go to school; tell them that this country and the western world were protected from alQaeda in Afghanistan throughout that period; and tell them that we have just mounted the biggest humanitarian airlift in recent history
6699," Eight times, the Royal Air Force rescued more than 400 people on board a single planethe most who have ever travelled on an RAF aircraft in its 103year historyhelping thousands of people in fear for their lives,  helping thousands to whom this country owes so much, and thereby revealing the fundamental values of the United Kingdom"
6700," Thanks to their remarkable efforts, thousands were evacuated, British nationals have returned safely to their families and Afghan friends are starting a new life here in Britain"
6701," Eighteen months passed between the Doha agreement and the fall of Kabul, yet as the Prime Minister now concedes, only 2,000 of the 8,000 people eligible for the Afghan relocations and assistance policyARAPscheme have been brought to Britain"
6702," In the last few weeks, MPs have had thousands of desperate calls from people trying to get to safety"
6703," From his service, he understands these issues deeply, but I must tell him that people listening to this debate across the country could be forgiven for not recognising that this country ceased military operations in Afghanistan in 2014"
6704," That is what we are going to do, and we will continue to show leadership in the G7, the P5, NATO and all the other forums in which this country leads the west"
6705," He is mightily relieved to be here, but understandably deeply concerned about the hundreds of his men and their family members who, although approved for relocation to the UK, were left behind"
6706," Gentleman knows, because he has heard me say it before, that there was a full review after the end of the military operation in 2014a review of what it achieved and of the legacy of those brave British men and women who served in  Afghanistan"
6707,"I have received hundreds of emails about Afghanistan from constituents, and I have British national constituentsa husband and his pregnant wifein Afghanistan"
6708, The thousands who are coming to this country are largely coming in through Heathrow and being quarantined in about seven hotels in my constituency
6709," Friend agree that, if we are tonight to help the people of Afghanistan, millions of whom are out in the open and will not be fed, we need to ensure that the whole international community focuses on doing so through the mechanism of the United Nations and probably through the traditional mechanism of a regional contact group, and that Britainthrough its experience on these matters, its membership of the UN Security Council and its G7 chairmanshipis now in a pivotal position to help the people I mentioned"
6710," Wiltshire, my county, is home to many thousands of British soldiers who have served with Afghan colleagues over the past 20 years"
6711,"I realise that the Governments focus at the moment is on refugees and dealing with the immediate crisis, but does the Prime Minister not think that, with tens of thousands of Afghan dead, thousands of American dead and hundreds of British dead, it is time for a full inquiry into the whole process that led us into Afghanistan and the whole notion of a foreign policy in which we intervene all over the world, and that we should start to reexamine our place and our role in this world"
6712,"Some 80% of the worlds heroin and opium supply originates in Afghanistan, providing the Taliban with more than half their income and causing untold misery across the world"
6713," The House has paid tribute, quite rightly, to the work of the armed services over the last few weeks and months, but it should also pay tribute to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Offices rapid reaction team who went to Afghanistan, and to the Border Force officials who went out there, who worked hand in glove to help thousands of people come to this country in safety"
6714, It is precisely to support those fantastic agencies that we have doubled our humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and the region to £286 million this year
6715," Friend join me in commending the team at Birmingham airport, Solihull Council and third sector organisations such as Entraide at Three Trees Community Centre, who have welcomed nearly 1,000 people a day, sometimes including many, many children and young babies"
6716," Before April we helped 1,400 people to safety from Afghanistan and, under the ARAP scheme, between then and 14 August we helped a further 2,000"
6717," I ask him to continue that, on behalf of the UK and the G7, for women and girls in Afghanistanboth for their education and their wider participation in Afghan society"
6718, Gentleman asked some specific questions about the handling of requests from those still in Afghanistan and those who have been interceding on their behalf
6719, I can tell him that by close of play today every single one of the emails from colleagues around this House will be answeredthousands and thousands have already been done
6720,"Just to help the House, let me say that we will be running this until around 4"
6721,The Council for AtRisk Academics has been rescuing scholars in danger from oppressive regimes since the Nazi period in 1933
6722,"As I have just reminded the House, the UK ended its military operation in Afghanistan in 2014"
6723,"The Prime Minister will be aware that the entire House is united in offering our respect and congratulations to the people at the grassroots who made the evacuation of British passport holders and Afghans possible in recent weeks, but he must also be aware of how difficult it has been to get responses from Government Departments on behalf of our constituents who are terrified for their relatives and want to arrange safe passage for them"
6724," Again, that calls into question where the 5,000 number comes from, because at the moment we are not even in a position to assess the position outside Kabul"
6725," However, we must look at its actions, not its words, and, as he has just pointed out, its action has been to release thousands of highvalue Taliban, alQaeda and Daesh fighters"
6726," Sorry, but more than half the people are not going to get inI do apologise"
6727," We want to help many of them to get out of Afghanistan but, for some reason, we are saying that we will take 20,000 over several years, but only 5,000 this year"
6728,"That is the 5,000 on whomwe are spending £200 million to bring a further 5,000 on top; I think it will be 10,000 altogether that we bring in  under the ARAP and other programmes"
6729," He makes a great deal today of the money he is putting in, but £292 million was spent in Afghanistan in 2019, and £155 million in 2021"
6730,"Is that not why it is so important that the UK Government maintain and increase their aid commitment No matter what the Foreign Secretary says about doubling aid, the reality is  that less aid money will go into Afghanistan this year than was previously planneda direct result of the unfortunate decision to cut aid from 0"
6731,7% to 0

6757," The human impact on the lives of millions of Afghans, especially women and refugees, is the most obvious and alarming consequence, but the impact on global politics and on Britains national security will be so negative that I fear this mistake will affect the lives of millions around the world for years to come"
