208," Given its dependence on linear advertising, we have concerns, looking at viewer trends, that that model will be difficult to sustain if Channel 4 is to continue to make the investment in content that I think we all want"
209," We are therefore looking afresh at what Channel 4 needs, not only to sustain itself, but to grow"
210,"I may have my facts wrong, but as I understand it, Channel 4 is phenomenally successful"
211," Its subscription service levels are something like a third higher than Netflixs in the UK, and All 4 is the largest subscription service in this country"

226, We know from the Governments own figures that there are 2 million people without the right sort of photo ID
227," We know that the alternative, which is forcing through photographic ID, is about a form of ID that more than 2 million voters lack, according to the Governments own figures"
228, The relevant part of the Bill is discriminatory and will disenfranchise millions of people
229,"It is a pleasure to speak in this debate, as I have at every stage of this Bill, and I am sure the Minister will agree that it is nice to be on the home stretch after so long, especially as she very bravely took over halfway through"
230," I should like to know whether the Electoral Commission will answer that question this week rather than next week, whether it would require evidence to be gathered both by itself and by the police lest there should be a case afterwards, and whether Mr Speaker might be able to take this up at 4 pm, when he is due to have a private meeting on the Electoral Commission"
231,"We should never forget, of course, that Her Majesty the Queen was among thousands who lost close family members during the troubles and that, by her actions, she has supported the efforts towards peace and reconciliation"
232, Will there be that commitment to prime time news for Channel 4 under a new ownership model
233,"Our TV and radio industry is one of our great success stories, and public service broadcasters such as Channel 4 are central to that success"
234," As a result, while streaming services have enjoyed a 19% increase in subscribers in recent years, the share of total viewers for linear TV channels such as the BBC and ITV has fallen by more than 20%"
235," Tomorrow, therefore, we will be publishing a White Paper that proposes major reforms to our decadesold broadcasting regulationsreforms that will put traditional broadcasters such as the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 on an even playing field with Netflix, Amazon Prime and others, and enable them to thrive in the streaming age"
236," The independent production sector has exploded in the last few decades, growing from a £500 million industry in 1995 to an industry of approximately £3 billion in 2019"
237," However, since it was structured to address the challenges of the 1980s, there are limits to Channel 4s ability to adapt to the 2020s and beyond"
238," Streamers such as Netflix spent £779 million on UK productions in 2020, more than twice as much as Channel 4"
239," While other PSBs, such as the BBC and Channel 5, have the freedom to make and sell their own content, Channel 4 has no inhouse studio and relies almost entirely on linear television advertising spend at a time when those revenues are rapidly shifting online"
240," The Government believe that it is time to unleash the broadcasters full potential and to open Channel 4 up to private ownership and investmentcrucially, while protecting its public service broadcasting remit"
241," We believe we can sell Channel 4 to a buyer who will fund emerging talent and independent and impartial news, and invest in every corner of the UK"
242, Only 7% of its revenue comes from Channel 4
243," We need to give people the skills to fill the jobs in them, so we will reinvest the proceeds of a Channel 4 sale into levelling up the creative sector and giving people in leftbehind areas the training and opportunity to work in the industry"
244," As I said, the future of Channel 4 is just one part of our wider reform of the entire broadcasting sector, and I look forward to providing the House with the full details shortly"
245," Channel 4 is an incredibly important economic asset in that ecosystem, and we want to make sure that it is sustainable not just now but long into the future"
246, We think it is our responsibility as the Government to do that futuregazing and to make sure that Channel 4 has the freedom and flexibility it needs to be able to make changes to thrive
247, We had very much hoped that we would be able to set the sale of Channel 4 in the context of a wider series of incredibly important reforms that we wish to make to the public service broadcasting sector
248," We think that we can get the right blend by retaining Channel 4s public service broadcast remit, which maintains its distinct and unique appeal, while enabling it to get the private sector capital investment that it requires to deal with some of the wider challenges presented by the likes of Netflix"
249," If Channel 4 is to remain uniquely appealing, we need that investment in content, and we believe that the reforms will give it greater sustainability going forward"
250," In this country, we are able to have a great blend of specific public service remits that private broadcasters can deliver, and that is what we would seek to do with Channel 4 going forward, protecting the things that we enjoy and love about it"
251, We believe that any future buyer of Channel 4 would seek to purchase it precisely to tap into the specific markets that it appeals to
252," Channel 4 has fundamentally accepted those concerns in providing us with a range of alternative options, which we have looked at very carefully"
253, Gentleman needs to understand that we are not seeking to have a subscription model for Channel 4
254,"Urgent Question To ask the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on the privatisation of Channel 4"
255,"Up and down the country, public service broadcasters, such as Channel 4, the BBC and ITV, are treasured national assets, delivering vital news, education, entertainment and sport"
256," Friend is working with me to help to improve that situation in rural Cumbria, but please, please can I urge the Government to rethink this Channel 4 privatisation idea Now is the time to support and bolster our public service broadcasters, not challenge them or lead them to being a competitive, subscriptionbased service, which is the last thing that our rural communities need"
257," Friend was right, of course, to say that previous Secretaries of State have considered the privatisation of Channel 4, but she will also recognise that not all of us were persuaded at the time that it was the right thing to do"
258," If the Government are determined to privatise Channel 4, she will also recognise, I am sure, that one of the things that makes Channel 4 distinctive is its willingness to take risks and commission work it cannot be sure will be successful"
259, Channel 4 will be gobbled up in no time by someone like the richest man in the world
260, That would not have happened without Channel 4
261, There are 81 jobs in Northern Ireland supported directly by Channel 4
262, It contributes £8 million annually to Northern Irelands GVA
263, Over a quarter of £1 billion is contributed to Northern Ireland as a result of television and film making
264," I grew up not too far from the Central Independent Television studios in Nottingham and have been a fan of Channel 4 over the years, particularly Fifteen to One, Football Italia, and my favourite, The Crystal Maze"
265," I am not too sure which zone the Opposition are in today, but does the Minister agree that this deal not only makes really good financial sense for the Government, but allows the purchasers of Channel 4 to raise capital to produce even more of the independent programming that we all value"
266," Working people are looking for help, but this week millions will look at their payslip and see a tax rise with his fingerprints all over it"
267, Five hundred thousand more peopleInterruption
268," Under Labour, just to remind everybody, youth unemployment rose by 45%"
269, The national insurance contribution went down by an average of £330
270,"What we are doing for working people is not only lifting the living wage by a record amount and helping people on universal credit with a £1,000 tax cut, but cutting national insurance contributions and lifting the threshold so that, on average, people pay £330 less"
271, Half a million moreInterruption
272," Gentleman asks about universal credit; we are tapering it so that working people get another £1,000 in their pocket"
273, By giving £0
274,"5 billion more to councils, we are making sure that we look after the types of people to whom the right hon"
275," The Scottish Government have introduced, and now doubled, the gamechanging Scottish child payment of at least £1,040 a year, helping those families who are being hit the hardest"
276," Here are three other ideas for the Prime Minister that would help families with their soaring costs right now scrapping his national insurance tax hike, reversing the Tory cuts to universal credit and matching Scotlands 6% benefits rise instead of imposing a realterms cut"
277, Those are three things that would make a difference to millions of people
278," This Bill is littered with various things we have voted against throughout the process, in relation to voting, to political finance and to electoral systems, but today we are really down to just two issues voter ID, as set out in part 1 of the Bill; and the independence of the Electoral Commission, as set out in part 3"
279, Nearly half of them do not have any photographic ID
280," When electoral ID was first introduced in Northern Ireland, there was a £2 charge"
281," Member for Torbay Kevin Foster, spoke about in the urgent question, where extra staff were employed and a million passports were processed in one month"
282," Member for Hayes and Harlington, and they are sitting at around 60% with no voter ID; in my constituency in Northern Ireland, where voter ID is required, turnout is higher"
283," I stood for election in my constituency in 92 when poll tax had been introduced and 5,000 people dropped off the register thereby the sound of it, most of them were Labour voters because I lost by 54 votes"
284, I did not suggest that Channel 4 would pursue a Netflix subscription model; I simply made the point that Netflix and othersthis is not a Netflix issue aloneare changing the dynamics of the marketplace very rapidly
285, She took the responsible decision to look not just at Channel 4 but at how we ensure that public service broadcasters have the flexibility they need to be able to provide the content that we all love
286," Friend plays an important role through her work with the allparty parliamentary group for Channel 4, and I am glad for the engagement that we have already had on the issue"
287, Friend raises the alternatives that Channel 4s management put forward
288, Our reforms are really to sustain Channel 4s place in in our creative ecology
289, I simply refer him to my previous answers we would maintain Channel 4 as a freetoair service
290, Channel 4 is intrinsic to making all of that work because it does something that no other broadcaster in the world ever did it guarantees diversity through the private sector for everybody
291,"All 4 is the UKs largest freeofcharge streaming service, providing entertainment and educational programming across the UK, without regard to users income, which is particularly important in this economic crisis"
292," The staff union, the Public and Commercial Services Union, has claimed that the Passport Office planned to recruit 1,700 new staff members to help deal with this increased demand, but only 300 have actually been brought in so far"
293,"In the year before covid, the aviation industry contributed £22 billion to the UK economy and £3"
294,"6 billion to the Exchequer through air passenger duty, and it is expected to be at 70% demand this summer, so we cannot put this at risk, for the sake of our economy"
295," I would also make the point again that 90% of applications were completed within six weeks, and the service standard is 10 weeks"
296," It was 13% higher than the previous record, so we are talking about it beating that record not by one but by some distance"
297," As I said, there are 500 extra staff and we are in the process of recruiting more; between January and March, 90% of applications were dealt with within six weeks; and support is there"
298," To be clear, those staff have now fully returned to passport production, and on 1 April more than 4,000 staff were working on it"
299," Last year, we sent 4"
300,7 million texts to those who had not renewed their passport to try to encourage more people to get their passport applications in
301," As I have touched on several times, we saw record output last month, with over 1 million passports dealt with in just one month, whereas normally we deal with 7 million across a whole year"
302," As of 1 April, there were more than 4,000 staff in passport production roles"
303,"Again, let us go back to what we have already said 4"
304,"7 million texts were sent out last year; 1 million passports were issued last montha record amount; more staff are being recruited; and existing staff, if they wish, are being given the opportunity to work incentivised overtime"
305," There has been a large amount of planning and work done to meet the challenge, but inevitably, with 2"
306,"5 million extra passport applications due this year, on top of the 7 million that we expect to receive from those whose passports fall due this year, there were going to be pressures in the system"
307," As I said, between January and March, 90% of people got their passport within six weeks"
308, I can assure him that we are absolutely determined that this will be article 2compliant
309,The Road Haulage Association has confirmed that the cost of moving goods from this part of the United Kingdom to Northern Ireland has risen by 27% in the first year of the operation of the protocol

311," She spent £7,000 on a holiday and is due to fly out on Sunday"
312," I echo the comments about the staff in the Belfast office, who are assiduous in their response on behalf of our constituents"
313,"Prior to the pandemic, HM Passport Office routinely processed approximately 7 million passports each year"
314, Over the last two years the necessary restrictions on international travel meant only 4 million people applied for a British passport in 2020 and 5 million in 2021
315, This left about 5 million unrenewed passports
316, We expect this year to deal with 9
317,5 million British passport applications and have been planning for this
318," These preparations ensured passport applications could be processed in record numbers, last month seeing the highest total for any month on record, with HM Passport Office completing the processing of over 1 million applications, 13% higher than the previous record output"
319," The vast majority of applications continue to be processed within 10 weeks; in fact, over 90% of applications were issued within 6 weeks between January and March 2022, despite the muchincreased demand"
320," Their hard work will enable millions of British citizens to enjoy a holiday abroad this summer, and I thank them for that"
321," I reassure people that, as I touched on, 90% of applications were done in six weeks"
322,"As we have touched on, we are seeing an unprecedented level of demand we would normally process 7 million applications in an entire year and did 1 million last month alone"
323," As I said, though, in recent months 90% of people have still been getting their passport within six weeks and we retain the ability to expedite if people have particularly compelling reasons for travel"
324," I do not expect that would massively mitigate the number of applications we are receiving, given that during the pandemic 5 million passports were not renewed, and we expect a lot of people will now want to renew, looking ahead to summer holiday travel, but I certainly welcome the right hon"
325," As I said, there are 5 million unrenewed passports and we expect 2"
326,"5 million of them to be renewed, and that is on top of the normal 7 millionstrong demand each year"
327," Last month we processed over 1 million applications, which is 30% higher than the previous record, and 90% of those between January and March were done within six weeks"
328," Certainly, 90% between January and March were issued within six weeks, so not the 10week standard, and over 1 million were issued last month"
329, We sent out 4
330,7 million texts to people who had not renewed their passports to point out that there might be a surge if they wished to travel in the following year
331," As I say, we are still managing to deal with most passport applications relatively quickly, with over 90% issued with six weeks"
332, No other month has seen over 1 million passports issued
333," In terms of being low on delivery, we delivered more than 1 million passport decisions last montha record number"
334," With a holiday booked in May, they risk losing thousands and thousands of pounds if they are unable to travel"
335," In 2020 and 2021, the Home Office was asked what it was doing to plan, but people are already losing holidays, trips to see loved ones and thousands of pounds that they have spent in good faith because of the lack of planning at the Passport Office and at the Home Office, which is in danger of becoming a StayatHome Office instead for people this summer"
336,"There has been a spike in demand for passports, but that should have been anticipated since we know that 5 million people put off renewing their passport during lockdown"
337, We will be unveiling very shortly another very exciting proposala competition in Northern Irelands schools for something to be presented to Her Majesty on behalf of the young people of Northern Ireland
338,"The Minister said in his opening remarks that over 90% of applications were meeting the timescales, but the particular problems, based on my own casework, seem to be with firsttime applications and children"
339,Some 4
340,5 million people pay for their gas and electricity through a prepayment meter
341, We are putting in £9
342,"1 billion, with an immediate £150 cut in peoples council tax"
343, Labours thing raises only £6
344,"6 billion, and it clobbers the very businesses that we need to invest in energy to bring the prices down for people across this country"
345, I am delighted that Mansfield was awarded £12 million as part of the towns fund
346," Amendment a will require the Secretary of State, when preparing a statement, to have regard to the duty placed on the commission by section 1451 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 to monitor and ensure compliance with the rules set out in that Act"
347, These amendments provide for enhanced parliamentary scrutiny of a statement that has been subject to statutory consultation under new section 4C of the 2000 Act by providing both Houses with a supplementary opportunity to consider the draft statement and make representations before it is laid for approval
348," It was therefore necessary for the Government to table Lords amendments 6 to 8, 13, 14, 24 to 28, 30 to 33, 37, 38, 40 to 43, 46 to 48, 51 to 63, 88 to 102, 117, 125 and 126 to ensure the measures apply to reserved matters only"
349," Rightly, much has been made of the calibre of some of Channel 4s programming, but tonights schedule includes The Great Home Transformation, Grand Designs The Streets, Bling Ring Hollywood Heist and Shocking Emergency Calls UK"
350, We think that any future buyer would look at the unique and distinct content that Channel 4 provides as one of its great assets
351," We are able to protect some of that via the remit, which we would seek to do, but it is also important that Channel 4 is only one part of why the creative sector has been very successful in Northern Ireland"
352,I very much welcome the opportunity to talk in this House about The Crystal Maze and the fantastic content that Channel 4 has produced over the years
353, Our reforms are fundamentally about making sure that Channel 4 can continue to make the investments that my hon
354," Given the cost of living crisis, why push ahead with forcing a successful, publicly owned Channel 4 to adopt a privately financed model when subscriptions are becoming a luxury that many people and families simply cannot afford"
355, Channel 4 is in the best state that it has been in creatively or financially for decades
356," If they do not, they could engage with Channel 4s management team about its proposalsI am not sure that we have all seen them in publicand explain why they prefer to go to the United States than to have a state broadcaster that is independent of Government"
357," Alongside the £617 million in city and growth deal funding, the levelling up, community renewal and community ownership funds have invested £62 million to date in the people and places most in need in Northern Ireland as a demonstration of our commitment to the people of Northern Ireland"
358," We certainly accept the point that there need to be significant improvements in the performance of the advice line and the MPs line, and we are already engaging with Home Office teams about how we can get more resources in so that people can have their queries answered, particularly when Members of Parliament raise issues on behalf of those with compelling and compassionate reasons for travel and therefore need their application to be expedited"
359,Independent production companies across our nations and regions rely on Channel 4s current operating model
360," Channel 4 is an  important public service broadcaster, but that does not mean that it has to be owned by the Government"
361," We will be looking at bidders who share our vision for Channel 4, the important role that it plays in investment in our creative industries and the distinct and unique remit that it has in our country"
362,"The selloff of Channel 4 is an important matter for Parliament, yet instead of a statement we had announcement by tweet during recess, and now we hear that a White Paper is to be published tomorrow, when we will not be here and there will not be an opportunity for statements"
363, Nothing screams rudderless Government like fixating on the governance of Channel 4 while peoples energy bills are going through the roof
364," Is it to help level up the country Given that Channel 4 commissions half its budget outside London, creating a pipeline of talent across the nations and regions, and stimulating the creative economy in places such as Leeds, Glasgow and Bristol, of course it is not"
365," Or is it to save the Treasury money I know that the Secretary of State was a bit confused about this in front of the Select Committee, but Channel 4 does not cost the taxpayer a single penny"
366," She says the selloff will generate a pot of up to £1 billion for her to dish out in grants, but Channel 4 already invests that amount here, commercially, each and every year"
367," She says she will protect the essence of Channel 4 in a new remit, but I thought that was the straitjacket she wanted to free it from"
368," Channel 4 is a great British asset, owned by the public, that does not cost them a penny"
369," As the Member of Parliament for Bradford West, Channel 4 in Leeds makes a real difference to diversity, especially in news channels and in journalism as a whole"
370," Can the Minister assure me that if we go down that road and they privatise it, the buyer will be required to maintain the presence and trajectory of workforce growth in Channel 4s regional offices in Leeds, Glasgow, Bristol and Manchester"
371," May I therefore urge on the Minister the very Conservative action of listening to the voice of small businessthe many small businesses and creative companiesthat Members from all sides of the House are praising because they provide innovation, creativity and jobs around the country, precisely serving the levellingup agenda Can she tell us, having looked at the consultation responses the Government have not published, what is the overwhelming voice from those small businesses They are all saying that Channel 4 is not broke and does not need fixing in this way"
372," For the supply chain, it will mean laying off up to 2,000 workers"
373,"Channel 4 invests about £20 million a year in Scottish independent production companies, contributing £36 million in gross  value added and supporting about 400 jobs"
374," Glasgowbased indies do get contracts with Netflix and the others, but they are clear that the Channel 4 model is at the heart of their success"
375,"How do the proposals genuinely fit in with our levellingup agenda What protections and safeguards would be put in place to ensure that Channel 4s HQ not only stays in Leeds, but continues to flourish there What safeguards can be put on Channel 4s excellent commitment to quality regional TV production so that it can continue to flourish, particularly because Channel 4 currently invests more in independent production companies outside London than any other broadcaster and supports thousands of jobs outside London"

393," By 2017, its vote had gone down by about 26%"
394," Does he agree that the UK Government have thus far committed £41 million to that project However, that was not what I wanted to intervene on; I wanted to intervene on his mention of the £500 million just transition fund for the northeast of Scotland"
395," Members for Kilmarnock and Loudoun Alan Brown and for Aberdeen South Stephen Flynn have not been able to do thus far, and describe in detail what that £500 million will be spent on in the northeast of Scotland"

400, Inflation stands at 7% and rising; household bills have gone up by hundreds of pounds; the cost of the weekly shop has rocketed; and people are seeing their wages run out much earlier in the month and the value of their savings fall
401," That would take £400 off energy bills every year and cut gas imports by 15%, but this Prime Minister is far too concerned with vanity projects ever to prioritise investment in insulating homes"
402," If the Tories had simply matched Labours record on growth in Government, people would have had higher incomes, boosting public finances, and we could have spent over £40 billion more on public services without having to raise a single tax"
403," Fraud has become commonplace, with 7 million incidents a year and Britain routinely ripped off, but the Business Secretary has suggested that it does not even count as crime"

409, Germany saw growth over the same period of over 13% in its exports
410," Across the G7, average growth in exports was 10%, yet Britain, under the Conservative party over the same decade, managed growth of just 4%"
411," Indeed, where is the serious plan to tackle the climate crisis If the Government had backed the Oppositions plans, we could double our onshore wind capacity to power an extra 10 million homes, back tidal power, triple solar power by 2030 and accelerate energy insulation to reduce the bills of working families and pensioners"
412," British banking is dominated by four large banks, which provide 70% of current accounts"
413, It did not do so during the LV debacle and almost £35 million of owners money was wasted as a result
414," In time, there will, I am sure, be much for us to be proud of about the councils actions under Labour control, particularly the response to covid, but we have to confront now the question of whether, despite cuts in Government funding to Harrow Council of more than 90%, better council services could have been provided"
415," It comes in a context where we have seen the Tory vote across Scotland  collapse, with the Labour revival amounting nationally to no more than a lacklustre 1"
416,6% increase in first preference votes on the council elections in 2017 and its secondworst local government performance since devolution in 1999
417,"7% living below the poverty line, sadly things look as though they are set to get even worse"
418," As well as the attacks on Scotlands democratically elected Parliament, which are set to continue, our resource budget allocation has been cut by Westminster by 5"
419,2% and the capital budget allocation has been cut by 9
420,7% in real terms
421," In all but one year, growth under this Government was less than 2%"

424, Last year there were 1
425,"78 million violent crimes, which is 1"
426,78 million opportunities to see the full cost of that failure
427," Gentleman does not want his speech dominated by the Northern Ireland issue, but will he accept that the Northern Ireland protocol is not only adding significantly to the cost of living crisis in Northern Ireland and slowing down the Northern Ireland economys recovery from covid, but poisoning the very essence of the Belfast agreement, and therefore stopping the working of the institutions It removes democracy, because not only Unionist Members, but all Members of the Assembly will have no say on 60% of the laws"
428," They could have chosen to ask energy companies to share a little of their grotesque wealth, or they could have asked landlords and property billionaires to pay a little more"
429," In my constituency alone, the Scottish Government are forced to spend £11"
430,8 million each year to mitigate the worst of what Westminster throws at us
431," As an aside, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Anna Cookson and the team on BBC Radio Kents  The Wake Up Call on, a week ago, winning an ARIAAudio and Radio Industry Awardin the teeth of competition from, I believe, the Today programme, Radio 5 Live and others"
432," I am not philosophically opposed to the privatisation of Channel 4, but I do believe we are in danger of throwing a baby out with the bathwater"
433," I hope very much that if we are going to continue to go down this road, we take great care to seek to secure the future of the independent production industry that Channel 4 has fostered"
434," Some two and a half years later, that commitment has not been honoured"
435," Companies such as Centrica, BP and Shell are making record profits, much of which goes to their already wellheeled shareholders, and yet my constituentsand those of Members on both sides of this Househave seen a 50% increase in the energy price cap and are likely to see an equivalent increase later this year"
436," She is frightened that that will go, and makes the point that his 3"
437,"1% benefit increase for his disability is, de facto, a serious decrease in his income, as inflation is likely to hit 10% later this year"
438, They have seen only a 3
439,"1% increase in their pensions, when they know inflation will hit levels way above that"
440," Even increasing the national minimum wage by 50p to £10, for which many on the Opposition Benches argue, would yield in the order of £900 a year"
441, The average income in my constituency is £250 a week less than is earned in wages in the Prime Ministers constituency
442," That is a staggering difference £12,500 a year per person working in a fulltime occupation"
443," We have a society that is now profoundly unequal, in which the billionaires are floating on a sea of riches while millions of people are living in poverty, including children and families in work"
444," When inequality and the lack of social mobility are put together, what do we have We have a class structure, the old British disease ossified, unchanging and built on a system that enriches a few and leaves so many millions behind"
445, Paying people in my area the same as people in the Prime Ministers would require a fifth of £1 billion a year; getting halfway there would cost us a staggering £100 million a year
446, It would cost £200 million a year to pay people in my constituency what people earn down in the Prime Ministers
447, That is why we have already committed £9
448,1 billion to assist with energy costs alone
449," We are giving back £150 to people in their council tax, cutting fuel duty, increasing the warm  home discount, creating a tax cut for 30 million workers by raising the national insurance threshold and delivering the biggest ever increase in the national living wage, worth an extra £1,000 a year to those working full time"
450," But however great our compassion and ingenuity, we cannot simply spend our way out of this problem; we need to grow out of the problem by creating hundreds of thousands of new highwage, highskilled jobs across the country"
451," This Government help people with the cost of heating, with the £9"
452,"1 billion that we are putting in, with the holiday activities and food programme and with the extra billions that we are putting in to support local councils"
453," We have heard a lot of words being very rapidly delivered, but what we have not heard yet is an apology to the pensioners who are choosing between heating and eating, an apology to the children who have gone hungry throughout the school holidays and an apology to the hundreds of thousands of family members of covid victims who were lost during the pandemic"
454,"I am very grateful for that intervention, and I agree 100% with what the hon"

456, I pay tribute to the speech that was given on her behalf
457," We are the rat run of choice for every HGV, whenever there is congestion on the M1 or the M40"
458," I do not know why that is so difficult, but I do know that by the end of the year, when inflation hits 10%, we will see even more people queuing at food banks, which is not a sight that any of us wish to see"
459," Of course, that situation will also be exacerbated by the 30% drop in Ukraines exports, particularly of cooking oil and wheat, which will increase hardship at our tables"
460," In the past few days, we have been bombarded with news of how household energy bills could hit £3,000 a year by October, how fire services across the country are reporting that they are dealing with blazes caused by people burning scraps of wood to keep warm, and, as was widely reported, how more than 2 million people are not eating every day because they just cannot afford it"
461," That move was referred to by the CEO of Tesco on Radio 4 today, and it would save every household hundreds of pounds a year on their fuel bills and provide muchneeded additional support to the lowestincome households"
462, The extra support in Wales includes a £150 cost of living payment to all households in properties in council tax bands A to D and to all those in receipt of any council tax benefit
463," There will be an extension to the Welsh winter fuel support scheme, which will provide people on low incomes and others with a nonrepayable £200 cash paymentnonrepayable being the key wordto help with their energy bills later this year, which they will receive on top of the £200 loan from the Government"
464," Today, we have 11,000 fewer police officers, 7,000 fewer police community support officers and 8,000 fewer police staff in work than we did when Labour left office in 2010"
465," With Wales facing a loss of more than £1 billion in unreplaced funding over the next three years, it begs the question as to whether the Prime Minister seriously thinks that the people of Wales have forgotten his Governments not a penny less promise to at least match, postBrexit, the size of the EU structural funds that Wales would have received"
466," Waless rail networks are underfunded by billions of pounds, and that needs addressing today"
467," We know that 14 million people are living in poverty, over 8 million of whom are in work"
468, We also know that 4
469,"5 million children living in poverty and, again, more than half of them are in working families"

471,"3 million more people living in absolute poverty, including 500,000 children"
472, She has developed estimates showing that £13
473,2 billion a year is being lost because of this differential in health
474," There is just 3%, when we know that inflation is currently at 7% and predicted to go to 10% by the end of the year"
475," That has to happen in the next three months, and the impact, according to the Governments own documents, is that nearly 1 million more people will be worse off"
476," A million more These are Government choices, unfortunately"
477," Friends and the people of Northern Ireland and in particular on behalf of the residents of Royal Hillsborough in my constituency We look forward to Her Majesty being able to travel to Northern Ireland again in the near future to stay with us in Hillsborough and meet again the very proud citizens of that village, who have recently been accorded royal status"

480, That is why I will be a loud voice for the brilliant Southend charity Prost8 and its groundbreaking work in this area
481," We have heard a lot of words being very rapidly delivered, but what we have not heard yet is an apology to the pensioners who are choosing between heating and eating, an apology to the children who have gone hungry throughout the school holidays and an apology to the hundreds of thousands of family members of covid victims who were lost during the pandemic"
482," Some of it is things that we have announced hundreds of millions of pounds for, getting on for two years ago now, that are bogged down in process, and often bogged down in Whitehall"
483, Two thirds of my generation bought their own home; today it is a quarter
484," We are at least a million houses short, in a period in which the  population has increased by 7 million"
485," We are about 100,000 houses a year short in what we are constructing, in addition to that million"
486," In the last 20 years or so, the top 1% of the population have roughly trebled their income whereas the median has roughly flatlined, so there is a stronger argument for social mobility today than there was before"
487," For me, that only highlights the question what on earth have they been doing for the last 12 years Why are we looking at negative growth Why are we looking at a projection of 10% inflation Why are we notand why were we not beforemore resilient and able to cope with the pandemic that hit us Why are my constituents wages stagnating Why are they not any better off The paucity of speakers remaining says an awful lot, too"
488," However, we now know that apprenticeship starts have declined since 2010 by nearly 200,000, or 41%"

492," Where is the security if people cannot afford to buy their own home and cannot qualify for social rented housing In my constituency, that is in massively short supply in any case, with hundredsthousandsof families living in massively overcrowded conditions"
493," Every policy so far has fuelled the equity of those who already own their home, rather than giving a real legup to wannabe firsttime buyers in constituencies such as mine, whereI have said this repeatedly in this House, but I repeat it againa modern twobedroom flat will be on the market for about £750,000"
494, That is a huge increase9
495,1% over the past five years
496," According to teachers in my constituency, children in years 7 and 8 are having to be taught how to do decent handwriting because they missed those crucial years at primary school"
497," In some areas, pupils in years 7 and 8 are losing out because the qualified teachers are focused on the exam years"

502, All of the hundreds of farms that I represent are in that position
503," This year, 13 of the farms that I representa tiny proportion, little more than 1%will be getting anything from the new sustainable farming incentive"

509," In Devon, this has meant a 70% reduction in the longterm private rented sector"
510," The proposal takes no account of the fact that, for instance, 90% of second homes bought in my constituency are bought for investment and then let out for 70 days a year"
511," So I am angry, not just on behalf of my community but on behalf of communities across rural areas of our great country, that there is so little, if anything at all, for us in this Queens Speech"
512," The Chancellor is getting £9 billion more in VAT receipts than the Budget prediction of £38 billion, yet the Government say that they cannot afford a VAT cut"
513," That does not just mean a VAT cut; we want to increase and extend the warm home discount to help more than 7 million people with their heating bills, and we want to increase the winter fuel payment to help pensioners betrayed by the Conservatives when they broke their election promise on the pensions triple lock"
514," Only last week, we learnt that BP and Shell are now raking in £1 billion in profit between them every single week from the same soaring gas and petrol prices that are making families suffer so much"
515," They are selling them down the river with trade deals that allow lowwelfare foreign imports to undercut responsible British farmers, and cutting the payments on which they rely, which is costing some of them up to half their entire income"

518," More than 1 million people are missing out on the care they need right now, and still the Government are doing nothing to help"
519," According to one set of figuresand they still keep changingit came in at £90 billion below the Office for Budget Responsibility and Treasury forecast, because with more growth comes more activity, more incomes and more spending, so the Treasury can collect more VAT and income tax"
520," The two main aims of economic policy should be a 2% inflation target, embedded as a Government target as well as a control mechanism on the Bank of England, and a complementary 2% growth targetnot that exacting in the context of 20thcentury experience in the United Kingdom, but fairly challenging in the context of the current centurys experience because of the disfiguring effect of the big banking crash and great recession in the middle of its first two decades"
521," Anyone who wants to see what happens with the playbook should look at what is happening in Turkey at the moment, and at what has happened, on a grotesque scale, in Venezuela, where the generous state kept printing and kept borrowing and ended up destroying more than half its national income and much of the potential of the oil industry, which used to pay for everything because it was nationalised and incompetently run"
522, It makes green sense because the CO2 output created by burning our own gas is considerably less than that of the elaborate process of carrying it halfway round the world and having it compressed and decompressed so that it can travel as LNG
523, It is about half the CO2 generated
524," First and foremost, on the need to address the cost of living crisis, the Government have brought in some measures to help to support families and businesses, but more targeted assistance is required to enable people to get through the coming year, which many are facing with fear and trepidation with the expectation of inflation at 10% and Ofgems increase in the energy cap looming in the autumn"

539," They want urgent action to secure peace in the middle east, an end to arms sales to brutal regimes and the restoration of the 0"
540,7% aid spending target
541," Gentleman agree that it is remarkable that, for a Government who say that they care about the cost of living crisis, there was absolutely nothing new in this Queens Speech around, for example, a mass home insulation programme Such a programme would be the cheapest, most effective and fastest way of getting our emissions down, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, and tackling climate emissions, and yet we have nothing new on that at all in this Queens Speech"

825," The Schools Bill banishes the lazy culture of low expectations and poor aspiration, which is also important, especially the increase in literacy and numeracy to 90% in young primary school students"
826," It is so important to remember that 60% of grammar schools are situated in 11 out of 150 local education authority areas, which is simply not right"
827," Given Channel 4s plans to provide 100,000 opportunities for young people starting in the media industry, to invest £2 billion in nations and regions content over the next decade and to become a truly digitalfirst public service broadcaster, the Governments plans to sell it off to the private sector are, I am afraid, severely misjudged"
828," Let us think of what Channel 4 has produced the Paralympics, Its a Sin, and Derry Girls, which was made in Northern Ireland"
829, These are all shows and features that have a British hallmark and would not have been made if Channel 4 did not have the freedom to prioritise public interest and purpose over profit
830," English is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, and the work of Channel 4 and the BBC gives our country international soft power that can hardly be imaginedI have seen it for myself"
831," When we think that, over the last seven years, we have spent no less than £701 million on developing new radar systems for Typhoon that will not be ready until 2030, we can see there is something desperately wrong with how we are planning to defend our country in the future"
832," There are challenges with the cost of living and inflation, but the Government have so far put in £22 billion of support, they are monitoring the situation and I am sure that, as things unfold, there will be further support as and when needed"
833, I would be very disappointed if the food we were producing reduced to below 50%
834," Meanwhile, oil and gas producers announce seismic growthbillionsin their profits, propped up by this Government, while they themselves have welcomed our suggestion of a windfall tax to help hardworking families"
835," With crime up by 18% under this Home Secretary, prosecutions down and criminals getting off, the Conservatives are clearly not taking crime seriously"
836," Under the Tories, hundreds of thousands more criminals are being let off the hook"
837," That is before we even consider the failure of prosecution rates, which have gone down from 8"
838,5% in 2015 to just 1
839,3%
840," Each carbon bomb would result in at least a billion tonnes of CO2 emissions over their lifetime and have catastrophic global impacts, yet nothing announced yesterday by this Government will help avert climate catastrophe"
841," I think the 1,000plus people who work at Springfields can look forward to extra work if this Government and any future Labour Government are committed to delivering on the ground, instead of just the talk we have had over the last 20 years"
842,"We meet during a cost of living emergency, which is why I am so taken aback that too many Tory MPs in this debatethough there are far too few here nowinstead of calling for the action and support that millions of people across our country need, have resorted to Alf Garnett cosplay, ranting about socalled benefit cheats, ranting about asylum seekers and fixating on a single protester outside Parliament and how he annoys them"
843," British billionaires increased their wealth hugely, by £290 million a day, in the first year of the pandemic"
844, We have seen billions of pounds handed out in crony Government covid contracts
845," We have seen multibillion pounds of tax cuts for bankers, even as banks are recording record profits"
846," The Tories scoff, but millions of people in this country will not take kindly to having it explained to them by the hon"
847," That is completely out of touch, despite the Alf Garnett theatrics, and it is completely contemptuous of the reality faced by millions of people in our society"
848," At the same time, gas and oil giants are making £900 profit every second"
849," Yesterdays Queens Speech should have been the moment to make our energy system work for people, not for profit, by including a windfall tax to raise billions to lower the bills of millions"
850," Not only that, it should have introduced the price caps we have seen in France, which have allowed bills to rise by only 4% and not by the 54% we have seen here, and we should have seen action to bring the energy system back into public ownership so that it works for people and not for profit"
851," But the Prime Minister and his Government are willing to accept millions of people being forced into fuel poverty because that, to them, is more acceptable than the alternative of reducing the profits of the oil and gas giants"
852, The tens of billions of pounds that would raise could be used to create a huge emergency fund to support people through the cost of living emergency
853,The Home Secretary talks about victims; why is crime up 18% but prosecutions are down 18%
854," All our staff who have offices in 1 Parliament Street suffer considerable stress and anxiety from the disruption he causes to their, and our, work"
855," He is causing misery to hundreds of staff, he is intimidating many"
856," Therefore, even though we have a onecity ecology strategy that says we want to protect 30% of the land as green space, we cannot oppose the planning application on those grounds because the previous local plan is still in place"
857, Channel 4 is not broken and does not need the Government to fix it
858," Privatising Channel 4 could mean £1 billion in investment lost from the UKs nations and regions, with over 60 independent production companies at risk of going under"
859," Gentleman would not want to inadvertently mislead the House, but the £700 million to which he refers is for options to develop"
860," We are also aware that as many as 16 million people may be in poverty by 2023, which is less than a year away, and, according to the Resolution Foundation, 1"
861,3 million are currently suffering in extreme poverty
862, That the UK Government have reduced nutritionspecific international aid by 70% is certainly concerning
863, It is relevant to point out that 83% of the individuals who took part in this survey were living in England
864," Using the malnutrition universal screening tool, the survey demonstrated that 40% of the participants were at medium or high risk of malnutrition, and that diseaserelated malnutrition at that time affected 1"
865,3 million people over the age of 65
866, Members can see how this mounts up to be a significant cost to the NHS that equates to around 15% of the total UK healthcare budget
867,5 billion
868," It has been calculated that treating a nonmalnourished patient amounts to £2,155, whereas treating a malnourished patient comes to £7,408"
869," She will also reflect on the fact that when the statistics for crime in England and Wales for year ending September 2021 were published, neighbourhood crime was 33% lower than the previous year, burglary offences were lower than the previous year, and other offences including robbery, vehicle offences and theft from the person were also down"

882,"7 billion to fasttrack Innovabranded lateral flow devices with an eyewatering profit margin to middle men, taking a tiny UK firm run by a property agent and a shoe retailer from being £3,500 in debt to a £20 million profit in a year"

911," In amendment 7, the Lords calls once again for asylum seekers to be granted the right to worknot granted the right to work but for their right to work to be recognised, because the right to work is a fundamental human right that cannot be taken away"
912," Over the course of the Bills progress, I have had literally hundreds of messages, ultimately asking for the whole Bill to be withdrawn, but if not, then at least to try to humanise it wherever possible, as their lordships have tried to do this evening"

915,7 million per day
916," The deterrent effect of a returns agreement would be so much stronger than the threat of being offloaded to Rwanda, because it would mean that every small boat refugee would be returned rather than just a tiny percentage, which is the most we can hope for from the Rwanda deal"
917," Lords amendments 6D, 6E and 6F provide  that a person can be a tier 1 refugee if they have travelled briefly through countries on their way to the UK, as somebody from Kabul or Kyiv would have to, or if they have delayed presenting themselves to the authorities for a good reason"

921, We certainly would not be spending £120 million on a press release

931, She has discussed the merits of the objections to phase 2b of HS2 with my constituents who are injuriously affected
932," Those facilities, together with another proposed arrangement at the Crewe rolling stock depot, will, I believe, waste an estimated £475 million of taxpayers money"
933," With a further £171 million of savings to be made by the use of a Transport and Works Act order on phase 2, the Minister will know that I and parliamentary colleagues are calling for less than half the total of the £650 million saved to be directed towards the reopening of eight miles of the former North Staffordshire railway"
934, I therefore call on the Minister to amend the phase 2 Bill and remove the proposals for Ashley when it returns to the House
935," I greatly look forward to further discussions taking place between my constituents, the Ministers officials and appointed rail experts on how we can make required improvements to the phase 2a proposals as soon as possible"

941," Before Easter, in February and March 2022, more than 85% of queue measurements were under 45 minutes for nonEU passengers"
942," Secondly, the cost of HS2 had continued to rise at an eyewatering rate, and that was before we saw the current huge rates of inflation, which will put it up further"

951," It is worth also reflecting on the other impact, which is that hundreds of police officers are pulled away from policing neighbourhoods across the UK, because forces provide each other with mutual aid"
952, That is why we consistently see 30% or 40% of our energy on many days in 2022 provided by renewables rather than by fossil fuels
953," We have made significant progress in the past 30 years, under Governments of all colours emissions down 40%, the economy up by nearly 80%, renewables now making up nearly 40% of our electricity generation in 2021, up from 7%, and by far the most advanced decarbonisation of any western country"
954, Last years United Nations Environment Programme production gap report concluded that in order to limit warming to 1
955,"5C, the world will need to decrease fossil fuel production by at least 6% per year between 2020 and 2030"

965," I do not support any strategy that defines winning at this critical juncture in human history in terms that literally sacrifice the future of humanity, or indeed policies like a climate checkpoint that would somehow greenlight the pumping of new North sea oil and gas when there is no global scenario in which that is compatible with keeping 1"

975," What is more, 70% of what is left in the North sea basin is oil, not gasand it is not even the type of oil that we use in UK refineries anyway"
976," No Government in their right mind would consider such a move, and nor would they continue to support the fossil fuel industry through tax breaks and financial support for exploration and for research and development, yet that is happening, to the tune of £12 billion a year"
977," I know the Treasury does  not consider a penny of that to be a subsidy, but New Economics Foundation analysis found that around £10 billionworth is indeed covered by the subsidy definition used by, for example, the International Monetary Fund"

1009,2 million last year
1010, From that £11

1050," That is £112,000 in total, and I am proud to report that the local community in Flint has raised £263,000 and counting"

1060," As we have heard, every year 1,800 children get a cancer diagnosis, and the biggest childhood cancer, leukaemia, accounts for about 30%"
1061," Just over 30% of children survived leukaemia in the 1970s, but things improved fast; in the 1990s, my cousin, Suzanne Adamson, had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia when she was 10 but she has gone on to have a wonderful life, with a second child on the way"
1062, So there are some good outcomes and the leukaemia survival rates in the 1990s were at 80%
1063," Cancer survival rates overall are now at 84%, but there is still room for improvement, as is shown by the death of Sophie"
1064," At present, there is still a 0% chance of fighting that cancer and being able to survive"

1075," What can be done to ensure that those who can and wish to be part of those trials can be part of them There is also no data publicly available to show progress towards the commitment of the 50% by 2025, and again I look to the Minister for help on that"
1076," Worryingly, there are also reports that referrals to principal treatment centres are only occurring in about half of all cases, despite that being contrary to NICE guidance"

1080, While 80% of children survive childhood cancer as a wholestill far too low80% of children with brain tumours die within five years of diagnosis
1081," It is the biggest cancer killer of those under the age of 40, yet brain tumours receive less than 1% of the national spend on cancer research"
1082,"I think the names that we have read out this afternoon show that, while cancer in children only accounts for 1% of cancer cases, if you are in that 1%, it does not feel very rare at all"
1083," I know from my experience as a nurse that we always serve food at 7, 12 and 6, and if someone is hungry in between, it is often very difficult to get any food at all"

1090," Seventy years ago, children simply did not recover or survive a cancer diagnosis; now around 80% do"

1249," We welcome the decision by the World Bank board in November to transfer £280 million to support the humanitarian response, but it is vitalit is vitalthat the World Bank produces options to allocate the $1"
1250,2 billion remaining in the fund
1251,"To correct the record, because it is important that we make accurate statements, between April and December 2021 we disbursed over £145 millionworth of aid, £135 million of which went into lifesaving humanitarian support inside Afghanistan, including for food, health, nutrition, shelter, water, sanitation and landmine action"
1252, Another £10 million went into neighbouring countries to support new and existing refugees
1253," Just to be clear, £135 million of our aid has gone, to the end of December"
1254," On the funding available to meet this crisis, it is really important that it is all unlocked, which is why I refer again to the importance of unlocking that $1"
1255,2 billion within the World Bank
1256," Our armed forces on the ground worked at great speed and in great danger to evacuate around 15,000 people to the UK"
1257," Since the end of Operation Pitting, the UK has supported nearly 1,300 people to leave Afghanistan, including 700 British nationals and eligible dependants"
1258, Women now account for more than half of all apprenticeship starts across the country and our apprenticeships diversity champions network is working with employers across the country to make sure we see the improvement we need
1259," It is by no means an exaggeration to say that the country is hurtling towards a humanitarian cliff edge that places millions of Afghans, including millions of children, at risk of starvation"
1260, More than 90% of the countrys health clinics and hospitals are without the funds that they need to stay open
1261," With 97% of the Afghan population soon to be living below the poverty line, almost 23 million people are teetering on the edge of starvation"
1262," Banks ran short, millions lost work or went unpaid and the currency nosedived"
1263," Of the £286 million pledged, so far only £81 million has been disbursed"

1266," The word Otherwise at the start of clause 196 currently refers back to clause 195, but it also needs to take account of the provisions of clause 206 which makes provision corresponding to clause 195 for oral hearing fees"
1267, The parties rights and obligations in relation to arbitration costs are governed by clauses 19 and 20
1268,"With rates of infection high among teenagers, many are simply unable to get double vaccinated yet as they were infected in the period when they would have been eligible and had to wait 12 weeks to get the jab"
1269," Unfortunately for families hoping to travel in half term, they cannot access a covid recovery certificate through the NHS app or through 119, despite contracting covid being the reason that they are not double vaccinated"
1270," Families are facing the prospect of cancelling their travel plans for half term, which will have an impact not only on our constituents but on the travel industry"
1271," I know that the Department is considering a solution, but will the Minister give some clarity that that will be achieved before half term, to give people the confidence to make travel plans"
1272,"Before Christmas, the JCVI issued the welcome guidance that five to 11yearolds who are either clinically vulnerable or living with someone who is immunosuppressed should be vaccinated against coronavirus, but since then we have heard very little"
1273," Can the Minister tell me when the rollout to five to 11yearolds will start, whether it will take place in schools or in vaccination centres, and how those who are immunocompromised will be identifiedthis is very important to those who are living with someone in that positiongiven that their GP records will not show their condition I declare a personal interest"

1278, The $4
1279,4 billion the UN has appealed for is only a stopgap

1282,4 billion requested

1288," Friend the Chancellor, including oneoff grants of up to £6,000 per premises for the hospitality sector and £30 million through the culture recovery fund"
1289," Members will be aware, the Bill defines a business tenancy as a tenancy to which part 2 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 appliesthat is to say it is a tenancy comprised of property that is or includes premises that are occupied by the tenant for business purposes"
1290," A tenant will still be in occupation if they are operating their business remotely and intend to return, so I do not believe amendment 9 is necessary"
1291," As I have previously explained, clause 17 establishes the timeframe for making awards, requiring arbitrators to make an award as soon as is practicable, or within 14 days in the case of an oral hearing"
1292, That means that it is hard for an arbitrator to know exactly when final proposals have been submitted and when the clock on the 14day time limit would start running
1293," Imposing a 14day time limit for issuing awards following an oral hearing, as the Bill doesalthough the time limit can be extendedis less problematic because the arbitrator will have seen the final proposals and had time to consider them before the hearing"
1294," Amendments 1 and 2 are technical amendments to make it clear that the definition of service charge in clause 2 covers both fixed and variable costs, as well as costs incurred by the landlord insuring against loss of rent"
1295," Amendments 4 and 7 make it clear that the general rule is that the party that has paid fees is to be reimbursed half the amount by the other party, but where appropriate, the arbitrator may determine a different proportion, including zero"
1296," Amendment 5 makes a small correction to clause 196 to make it clear that except for reimbursement of arbitration or oral hearing fees, a party must meet its own legal or other costs"
1297, Amendment 6 makes it clear that costs incurred in connection with arbitration are not recoverable under an existing clause in the lease
1298," The Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Department for the Economy have requested the removal of the existing delegated power for them to make regulations for purposes corresponding to the purposes of the Bill, set out in clause 28"
1299," The removal of clause 28 necessitates an amendment to the Extent provision in clause 302, which currently refers to this provision"
1300,"It is a pleasure to speak to new clause 1 and amendments 9 to 17, which stand in my name and in the name of my hon"
1301," On that basis, we have tabled new clause 1 and our other amendments in a positive spirit, to continue the dialogue that we had at the earlier stages of the Bill, because we support it and want it to work as effectively as possible"
1302," Predictability and consistency will be vital if those businesses are to have faith in the system, so   our new clause 1 would require the Secretary of State to conduct a review of awards to assess whether clauses 15 and 16 have been interpreted consistently"
1303," Clause 9 establishes a sixmonth period for a tenant or landlord to make a reference to arbitration, for which the clock starts on the day on which the Act is passed"
1304, Amendment 10 reflects the suggestion by Bill Chandler of Hill Dickinson LLP  that the date for referrals to open be fixed as 25 March 2022 irrespective of whether the legislation is passed
1305, Could the Minister update the House on those discussions Clause 19 gives the Secretary of State the discretion to specify ceilings for arbitration fees in secondary legislation
1306," Given the concerns of stakeholders and the financial pressures they are facing, the Secretary of State should be required to set a limit on arbitration fees, and that is the intention of amendment 16"
1307," That is why we have tabled amendment 17, which would remove this arbitrary cutoff date"
1308," The Governments impact assessment assumes 8,200 cases going to arbitration in its central scenario"
1309, The intention of amendment 13 is to make that an explicit and ongoing duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that the arbitral bodies appointed have sufficient numbers of arbitrators to hear and report on all cases as quickly as possible
1310, The British Retail Consortium estimated in December that 80% to 90% of its members had reached agreement
1311," That is why our amendment 14 revises clause 11 and requires a formal proposal to be accompanied by all evidence relevant to the proposal, whether helpful to that party or not"
1312," Although a 5050 split is fair in most cases, it is right that the arbitrator has the power to change how the arbitration fees are split, particularly if one party has acted unreasonably"
1313," That is why we have tabled amendment 12, which would provide the arbitrator with the power to make an adverse cost award, where one party has caused the other to incur costs by acting unreasonably"
1314," While clause 17 requires the arbitrator to make their award within 14 days  in a case in which an oral hearing is held, where no oral hearing is held the arbitrator is required to make their award as soon as reasonably practicable"
1315, Labours amendment 15 intends to ensure that awards are made within a specific timeframe irrespective of whether there is an oral hearing
1316,"Amendments made 19, page 16, leave out lines 14 and 15"
1317," The rest of clause 302 which provides that Part 4 of the Bill extends to the whole of the UK is reproduced in Amendment 20, so the whole of clause 302 can be omitted"
1318," Indeed, the Bills impact assessment notes that, according to the Treasury analysis, the total amount of deferred rent liabilities may be at around £9 billion by March 2022"
1319," UKHospitality found that the average hospitality venue lost over £10,000 in the weeks leading up to Christmas, with Christmas day takings down 60% compared with those in 2019"
1320," A December surveythe period between some of the stages of the Billby the Night Time Industries Association found that the outstanding business debt from their members was, on average, around over £200,000 per unit"
1321," That is why we have had a package of £750 million of support for charities, which indicates their importance and how they have been involved throughout the pandemic"
1322," One of them will be in procurement, which is worth £300 billion a year to our economy"
1323," Bearing in mind the Prime Ministers distant relationship with the truth, will the Minister outline exactly how the public, and Covid19 Bereaved Families for Justice, can have any faith in this inquiry at all"
1324," However, I am very pleased to say that in November 2019, the public prosecutors office in Bahrain announced the release of 75 prisoners, most of whom claimed that they were in prison for political reasons, so it is not true that socalled political prisoners have not been released"
1325, I also saw a large noticeboard in the police headquarters that seemed to have well over 100 photographs of young policemen and quite a few policewomen who had been murdered by terrorists
1326," During Bahrains popular prodemocracy uprising 11 years ago, the regime demolished 38 Shia Muslim mosques"
1327," Following that attack, 64 political prisoners were forcibly disappeared for 19 days and held incommunicado for between 30 and 36 days, during which time they were unable to contact their families or their lawyers, in a flagrant violation of both national and international law"
1328, It is to the credit of Lewis Hamilton and others that they used their substantial media presence to highlight human rights abuses in Bahrain when they were there for the Formula 1 race
1329," The best response of Formula 1 would be to say that it will refuse to go countries where there are significant human rights abuses, rather than expecting drivers individually to make such statements"
1330," Over the last five years, we have seen the cyber sector grow significantly, with more than 1,400 businesses generating revenues of £8"
1331,"9 billion last year alone, and supporting 46,700 skilled jobs"
1332," That is also why we are targeting key sectors as part of that strategy, such as through the CyberFirst programme, which will ensure that 6,500 pupils from 600 schools can benefit, in particular by attracting girls into that competition so that they are a part of the cyberstrategy"
1333," They should be subject to the normal rules that the rest of us expect, with an accountable police force, a transparent legal system and prison conditions that do not allow torture or force 12 people into a very small cell, which itself is a torture"
1334," Dr alSingace is one of an estimated 1,400 political prisoners being held in Jau prison, 500 of whom have been sentenced to 20 years or more"
1335, It is of equal importance that the debate gives us the opportunity to question the Government and ask once again why they continue to turn a blind eye to human rights abuses in Bahrain while sending millions of pounds of taxpayers cash to the Gulf state via the highly secretive Gulf strategy fund
1336, A freedom of information request by the Scottish National party revealed that the Gulf strategy fund was increased by 145% last year
1337," Arguably, the most urgent of these cases is that of Dr alSingace, the 59yearold academic and human rights activist who was initially detained in 2010, having returned from speaking at a conference in the House of Lords"
1338," In October last year, 46 parliamentarians signed an open letter to the Foreign Secretary asking her to intervene on behalf of Dr alSingace and his family, but I am sorry to say that nothing has been done and the Government have remained largely silent"
1339," Another case worthy of highlighting is that of 74yearold Hassan Mushaima, the former leader of Bahrains opposition, who is also serving a life sentence, having been jailed in the aftermath of the prodemocracy uprising in 2011"
1340," In December, Ali held his own hunger strike outside the Bahraini embassy here in London for 23 days, demanding the release of all political prisoners, including his father"
1341," Of the 26 people awaiting execution in Bahrain, no fewer than 12 have been convicted of political charges"
1342, A recent report by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy and Reprieve found that executions in Bahrain have increased by a factor of 10 since the UK began its financial assistance through the integrated activity fund in 2017
1343," One of them will be in procurement, which is worth £300 billion a year to our economy"
1344," We draw on 100 years of probation experience, for example, and we are using it to encourage and support Bahrainiled judicial reform"
1345," To date, more than 3,600 individuals have had potential prison time replaced by alternative sentences, and further cases remain under consideration by the judiciary"
1346, I remind the House that more than 90 security personal have been prosecuted or face disciplinary action because of investigations carried out by human rights oversight bodies that the UK Government support
1347," We have heard much about Mr alSingace this afternoon, a 59yearold academic languishing in prison following his peaceful opposition to Bahrains dictatorship during the 2011 Arab spring"
1348, I fully support earlyday motion 578 calling for the UK Government to impose Magnitsky sanctions on those responsible for the unlawful imprisonment of Dr alSingace
1349," It is even more curious that, while the UK Government were cutting humanitarian aid by billions last year, including for clean water and nutrition, their support for the Gulf strategy fund, the former integrated activity fund, increased by 154%"
1350," However, while the pressure for such an inquiry grows, the fund continues to operate, despite billions of pounds of cuts to international aid spending by this Government"
1351, I hope to meet Bahraini authorities and FCDO officials in the coming months and encourage colleagues to sign earlyday motion 835 on human rights in Bahrain to express our collective concern about the situation and support a true path to reform
1352," At Christmas, I delivered hampers of fresh local produce to over 100 veterans across the Workington constituency to thank them for their service"
1353, The meeting also took place following the arrest and abuse of 13 children who were subjected to threats of rape and electric shock
1354," There are currently about 1,500 political prisoners in the small kingdom, according to the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy"
1355," I would say that Muslim women in particular experience a triple whammy of race, faith and gender, and Tell MAMA has told us of the 40% increase in abuse against Muslim women during the lockdown"
1356," Polling by Compassion in Politics shows that more than 80% of social media users would provide evidence to get verified accounts, and making verified accounts the default optionnot the only optionwould help to stop some of the abuse"
1357," He was just 13 when he died, and he had his whole life ahead of him"
1358, None of those 11 platforms took down that content
1359," They are always looking for the next chink in our digital armour, so I am glad that paragraph 186 of the report makes it clear that we need to act on the human consequences of online fraudnot just the financial  effects, but the psychological effects"
1360, I welcome the recommendations that clause 414 be amended to add an offence of fraud and similarly that related clauses be introduced or amended so that companies are required to address it proactively
1361," As such, I support the Committees recommendations in paragraphs 268 to 271 of the report, which would bring such advertising into scope"
1362," The reason for all this is cynically simple the more that people view this content and stay on the platform, the more advertisements that the big tech companies are able to sell, and 99% of Facebooks income is from advertising"
1363,"Relevant documents Epetition 575833, Make verified ID a requirement for opening a social media account, and epetition 332315, Ban anonymous accounts on social media; oral evidence taken before the Petitions Committee on 21 May and 2 July 2020, and 2, 16 and 23 November, and 1 December 2021, on Tackling Online Abuse, HC 364 Session 201921 and HC 479"
1364," Some 76% of girls aged 12 to 18, and 41% of all women, have reported being sent unsolicited penis images"
1365," According to the dating app Bumble, 48% of millennial women said they had been sent an unsolicited sexual image in the last year alone"
1366," First, if the reports suggestion of replacing clause 11 of the Bill with a list of online harms is accepted by the Government, pornography should be listed as an online harm"
1367," For many of us in this House it was troubling that the Government in 2019 abandoned part 3 of the Digital Economy Act 2017, leaving children with no protection online"
1368," In the interim, the Government must implement part 3 of the 2017 Act, and then the design code and this Bill can be used to offer greater protection"
1369, Even fines of £50 million are not significant against Facebooks gross revenue of more than £29 billion
1370," Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe Damian Collins, its Chairman, has done excellent work on this, particularly in pages 58 to 60 and 75 to 79 of the report"
1371," Up to 40% of all crime is now fraud and, as the report says, 85% of fraud involves the internet in some way or other, so it is crucial that we cover this in the Bill"
1372," It needs to be covered under clause 414 and priority illegal content, so that platforms have to be proactive in taking this stuff down"
1373, We also need to be looking at clause 39 and removing paidfor ads to make sure that platforms are also proactive in removing paidfor online fraudulent content
1374," At Christmas, I delivered hampers of fresh local produce to over 100 veterans across the Workington constituency to thank them for their service"
1375," I say murderer and terrorist, because it was accepted in court that Joe McCann had shot 15 soldiers"
1376," 10 all consecutively and repeatedly blamed each other, to me personally and in the newspapers, and not a single word of progress was made"
1377," To say that he has not prosecuted anyone completely misses the point; 22 files are currently with the prosecution service, but he does not have the resources to process them in a timely manner"
1378, It is a great tribute to those working in our NHS that almost eight out of 10 eligible adults in England are now boosted
1379," Suicide remains a major public health problem, with the highest suicide rates among men aged 45 to 49"
1380, It is the biggest killer of young people aged 16 to 24 and the suicide rate for young women is now at its highest on record
1381, A 2017 inquiry into suicides of young people found suiciderelated internet use in nearly 26% of deaths in under20s and 13% of deaths in 20 to 24year olds
1382, One in 15 adults in England report that they have selfharmed
1383," In 11 sitting weeks, we received more than 200 submissions of written evidence, took oral evidence from 50 witnesses and held four further roundtable meetings with outside experts, as well as Members of both Houses"
1384," I know some Members have suggested that a Joint Committee on online harms would have terms of reference mirroring those of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Intelligence and Security Committee, but the Joint Committee on Human Rights was certainly never enshrined in the Human Rights Act 1998, and the responsibility of the Intelligence and Security Committee is to provide oversight for policies, expenditure, and operations adopted by MI5, MI6 and GCHQ"
1385," When I asked about the cost of establishing the Joint Committee, I was told that it would be £500,000 a year"
1386,152
1387," As I said, my constituent Joe, a popular young person, was 23, so the fact that he was over 18 did not mean that he was safe from this kind of harmful online content"
1388," I am pleased to see that that matches up with the report, but I appreciate that there is a difference of opinion on whether clause 11 should remain"
1389,"I congratulate the Joint Committee on an excellent report, consisting of 191 pages of wellresearched, balanced, temperate and intelligent analysis and recommendations"
1390," Over the last five years, we have seen the cyber sector grow significantly, with more than 1,400 businesses generating revenues of £8"
1391,"9 billion last year alone, and supporting 46,700 skilled jobs"
1392," That is also why we are targeting key sectors as part of that strategy, such as through the CyberFirst programme, which will ensure that 6,500 pupils from 600 schools can benefit, in particular by attracting girls into that competition so that they are a part of the cyberstrategy"
1393," An estimated 86% of fraud is committed onlineAction Fraud has told us that victims of pensionsrelated scams who had worked their whole lives to build a retirement fund had lost £82,000 on averageOnline platforms, such as search engines and social media platforms, are playing an increasingly significant role in putting consumers at risk of harm by exposing them to adverts for financial productsFraudsters have unprecedentedly cheap access to an online population of consumers who find it difficult to differentiate genuine offers from the fraudulentThere are ads online for firms that dont exist, for firms that claim to be regulated but arent, for firms that claim to be based in the UK but arent and for clones of legitimate authorised firms"
1394, The public certainly want that; Aviva has published research concluding that 87% of the public want the Government to legislate to stop search engines and social media platforms promoting financial scams through advertising
1395," It will be years before that work delivers, and in the meantime thousands will have lost their life savings and UK financial services will have suffered further damage"
1396, The figure I have is from Action Fraud 85% of the £1
1397,7 billion lost in fraudulent scams in the past year resulted from cyberenabled frauds
1398," Member references, but as I said in my answer a moment ago, we have had a package of £750 million of support"
1399," While I welcome the temporary funding for local resilience forums announced last year, it is just a meagre £7"

1404," Although young people whose parents did not go to university made up more than half of external applicants, they made up only less than a third of those who were offered jobs"
1405, One of the children in a primary 7 class in a QA asked me what was the difference between Northern Ireland today and the Northern Ireland in which I spent the early years of my life
1406," Friend, whom I have heard speak on this many times over the years, is right that those who went to Northern Ireland to serve Queen and country, to uphold the rule of law, and to resist a brutal, barbaric campaign of Irish republican terror did so courageously, and it is wrong that they should now be hauled through processes for events some of which are 40, 45 years old or even older"
1407,"It was so good to hear the Paymaster General praising civil servants, so could he please explain why the Foreign Secretary overruled civil servants advice and went to a £3,000 lunch in a private members club owned by a Tory donor, and he calls that abiding by the code Will the Paymaster General immediately include that in the investigation being undertaken into the other boozy parties in No"

1412, A study commissioned by Facebook showed that over 60% of people who joined groups that showed extremist content did so at the active recommendation of the platform itself
1413, He highlights an extremely important Brexit opportunity around our £300 billion procurement spend
1414, There has been over £400 billion of support from the Government as part of our pandemic response
1415," I will not run through the full quantum of them, but just to take one, there are the oneoff grants of up to £6,000 per premises to support the hospitality and leisure sector"
1416," A local SME in my constituency invested more than £700,000 in automating its hand sanitiser production, but now finds that most of its UK Government Department customers have gone back to their original foreign suppliers"
1417," We know that people often seek out elected representatives when they are at their most vulnerable and in deepest crisis, and for thousands of people, councillors are a vital backstop day in, day out"
1418, He was convicted of 16 counts of downloading indecent photographs of children
1419, 56
1420," Friend the Member for StokeonTrent Central Jo Gideon said, these amendments would permanently bar, for example, an individual from standing for local office if, perhaps, at 18 they had had a glass of wine too many and were convicted of being slightly over the limit"
1421," New clause 3 may have been supported by the Chancellor in his foreword when he was serving in this role, but he is not the Bill MinisterI amand I believe that Bills such as this should be specific, targeted and focused"
1422, Amendments 1 and 4 would selectively remove parish councils from the list of local authorities subject to the new disqualification criteria
1423," Parish councils are already subject to the existing disqualification criteria, and rightly so, as there are 10,000 parish councils and approximately 100,000 parish councillors in England"
1424," I should clarify that the 2017 consultation responses regarding the matter of sexual risk orders were mixed some 39% of respondents were in favour of prohibition, and 45% were against"
1425, It is always a stark reminder when I am told that about 75% of women in the world are illiterate
1426," Perhaps inevitably when there are 120,000 councillors serving all tiers of local government in England, however, there are rare occasions when the behaviour of individuals falls below the standards that the public rightly expect"
1427, Why should people who are in that position be allowed to continue as councillors while other councillors who have been convicted of a different set of antisocial offences are excluded That is the essence of new clause 1
1428," The new clause is particularly topical, because it fits in with the 10year drugs plan to cut crime and save lives, which Her Majestys Government published in December 2021"
1429," So can we tolerate a situation in which local councillors may themselves have been convicted of offences against the Misuse of Drugs Act, in complete defiance of the Governments strategy, which I think has universal support across the country That is the essence of new clause 2"
1430," In the response to the consultation, they say that 65% of respondents agreed with that proposalthe proposal to disqualify, for such behaviour, from being able to be a councillor, 22% were against and 12% of people did not know"
1431," I submit, with all modesty, that new clause 3 has support at the very highest levels of Government from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as we have not heard anything from him to suggest that he has changed his mind since 2018"
1432," Now we are at that stage, why can we not accept new clause 3 The other amendments I have fit in with what I have just been saying"

1444, How does she believe that the 50 BBC employees based in my constituency are currently feeling because of the announcement she made on Twitter over the weekend

1448," Tens of thousands of people supported getting rid of the BBC licence fee and very few were against it, so may I thank the Secretary of State for coming to the House today and making a statement If my Bill is of any use to her, I would be very happy to change in Committee any of the stuff I have there at the moment"
1449,"As I said, when the new model starts in 202728, many of us may not even be herewe are talking six years away"
1450, I am not going to conflate Channel 4 with the BBC; I am here to talk about the settlement of the licence fee
1451," The BBC, with the billions of pounds of funding£23 billionit is receiving, will still be able to meet its core mission and purposes"
1452, It is worth making the point that the BBC will continue to receive billions of pounds of public support and funding between now and 2027
1453," Gentleman talks about £159, but the BBC wanted it to project to £180"
1454,"The licence fee settlement ensures that the BBC can continue to meet its mission and its purposes, and it will continue to receive billions of pounds of funding£23 billion over the licence fee settlement period"
1455, Gentleman was going to thank me for the additional £7
1456,5 million that we are giving to S4C
1457," I thought he was going to thank us for the fact that S4Cs funding, having been frozen for the past five years, is now being increased and we are freezing the BBCs funding"

1467," Does he agree, therefore, that extending the franchise to 16 and 17yearolds, who will go on to develop a far stronger commitment to voting, will actually strengthen our democracy against foreign interference in British politics"
1468," 15, Q13"
1469," We know that 16 and 17yearolds, when given the chance, take it very seriously"
1470," In Scotland and Wales, they have higher rates of turnout than 18 to 24yearolds, with 75% voting and 97% saying that they would vote in future elections"
1471," There has been success in Northern Ireland and voting turnout has increased, but the statistics also show that 98% of voters already have sufficient ID in place for voting, and we are almost there"
1472," All we need is for the other 2% to be done, and Northern Ireland will achieve that goal of having everybody with an ID"
1473," There will be no time limit, but he must resume his seat no later than 8"
1474,55
1475," Friend for going through the implications of new clause 11, which I very much welcome"

1482," Article 1 in part 1 of the UN convention on the rights of the child says that a child is a child until 18 years of age, so I do not understand why the SNP is still backing child marriage"
1483,"With regard to voter participation among 16 and 17yearolds in Scotland, another reason we have such a healthy turnout is that all the elections in which they participate are conducted on a proportional basis"
1484," That is why, Madam Deputy Speaker, I very much hope that you might allow me the chance to test the opinion of the House on new clause 13"
1485," Even where nonphotographic ID was used in the trials and given to everyone, about 1% of people were turned away just because they had forgotten to take it from their house to the polling station"
1486," Now in a number of our seats 1% is a margin of error that would have changed the course of an election, and in tight years it could change the course of who is in government"
1487, Member not recognise that the same treaty says that under18s should have a say in the future of their life and have democratic participation in the countries they live in

1490," Does the Secretary of State agree that 43p a day is value for money for BBC iPlayer, BBC Sounds and the BBC World Service"
1491,"I wish the Secretary of State would stop with the crocodile tears about the costofliving crisis, because £159 is a lot of money, particularly for my constituents, but it happens to be exactly the same amount, on average, as they will pay in extra national insurance from April this year"
1492," She says that the BBC gets lots of money, but Sky got five times as much money this year, and its revenues this year increased by 18"
1493,9%
1494,I think there were about 30 questions in that statement so I will address the top points
1495," Whether getting by on minimum wage or on a multimillionpound presenters salary, we fork out the same amount of money"
1496," Do not be under any illusions the BBC will continue to receive billions of pounds, even under this settlement"

1502," We are committed to S4C, and we are providing it with additional funding"
1503,Many of us find it nauseating that the Secretary of State has come here to talk about hardpressed families when she supported the £20 cut to universal credit
1504," So could we test how much she considered some of these factors, perhaps in the style of the broadcast media How much more money is generated by the investment in the BBC Is it £1, £2 or £3 She talks about the north"
1505," How much of the BBCs economic impact is beyond London Is it 10%, 20% or 50% Perhaps she could demonstrate her knowledge at least of the BBCs impact"

1507," If a donation is over the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 threshold of £25,000 in a calendar year, the UA will have to disclose whatever details it knows of the name and address of the person who made the gift, but it would not be prevented from receiving and then donating that gift"
1508," Perhaps the most infamous example is the Democratic Unionist partys £435,000 donation to Vote Leave, which was channelled via a UA, the Constitutional Research Council"
1509," It was consequently fined just £6,000a penalty totalling little more than 1% of its donations, which could well simply be seen as the cost of doing business"
1510, Those clubs have given well over £1 million to the Conservatives
1511," New clause 18 would quite simply require unincorporated associations that meet the threshold for registration with the Electoral Commission to conduct checks to establish whether a person donating for political purposes is a permissible donor and, if not, to reject that donation as the Committee on Standards in Public Life has recommended"
1512,"I rise to speak to new clause 16, in my name and that of Members from four of the parties represented here in Westminster"
1513,"EU and the mysterious source of his gigantic loans from Rock Servicesor was it Rock Holdings Thanks to evidence given to Carole Cadwalladr and the heroic reporting of The Guardian, we know that there are all kinds of interesting and no doubt innocent connections, such as the fact that Mr Bankss wife, Katya Banks, was given entry into the country on a passport serially numbered to a passport given to someone who MI5 reported as a Russian spy"
1514," Let us take another honourable donor, Mr Mohamed Amersi, a man who together with his partner has given   nearly £800,000 to good causes and who, it would seem, might qualify for a walkon part in John le Carrs The Night Manager, but not as Jonathan Pine"
1515," The point is that I can raise questions here that warrant further investigationquestions about, for example, Lubov Chernukhin, the model of generosity who has given the Conservatives £2"

1522," In 2019, 59 million votes were cast and there was a single conviction for voter personation"
1523,"I have significant issues with new clause 13, as drafted, which simply asks to introduce a proportional system"

1526," New clause 2 would simply prevent anyone registered as such an overseas elector from donating to political parties in the UK, while new clause 9 would require individual and company donors to be based in the UK while making those in charge of companies liable for any offences caused"
1527, We also have new clause 16 tabled by my right hon
1528, The Bill takes away the barriers that kept it at £1 million
1529," The strength of feeling on the issue is shown by the variety of other new clauses2, 8, 16 and 18that cover that subject"
1530, Amendment 3 would remove those provisions
1531," Similarly, we will support amendments 11 and 12, which delete parts of this provision"
1532," However, the sheer volume of changes and changed directions in the Bill is a sign of how halfbaked it started"
1533,"Despite the fact that the removal of the free licence for the over75s was a result of her own partys actions, the Secretary of States tweet yesterday indicated that her  attack on the BBC was due to the over75s being threatened with prison sentences and bailiffs knocking on their doors"

1540, We lose 2 million voters and that is the snapshot they use to propose a boundary change to reduce the number of MPs to 600

1543," Despite the highest election turnout in 120 years, the big lie has been amplified that Trump actually won in 2020"

1545, I urge all Members who value our democracy to support amendment 1
1546," With that in mind, I put particular focus on new clause 11 and new schedule 1, which have been put forward by the Government"
1547, That information would then be published on the returning officers statement of persons nominated by virtue of Rule 143A

1582,"When the BBC came before the Public Accounts Committee, it was striking how unambitious its target was for growing commercial revenues, which represent just 6% of its current income"

1586," Friend the Member for Maldon Mr Whittingdale highlighted, 700,000 fewer people are paying the licence fee"
1587,"It is billions of pounds, and I do not believe that any family receiving repeated letters, or a bailiff knocking on their door, or a request to appear at a magistrates court would think it is value for money, because it is money they cannot afford"
1588," The issue is that working families and people who are hard pressed in the current situation of rising inflationary pressures think it is difficult to pay £159 a year out of their income, which is why we are freezing the licence fee for the next two years and not allowing it to rise"

1599," That makes it 184,000 to one; this is racking up faster than Downing Street parties"
1600," The Cabinet Office itself says that that approach will exclude 2% of the electorate without the right form of ID, but according to the Electoral Commission the actual figure of those without the right ID will be between 1 million and 3"

1670," When I had 3,000 respondents to a survey, 96% of them agreed with that"
1671," Friend agree that this Bill is not really about updating electoral law It is about driving a bulldozer through the electoral processes of this country, demolishing our democracy, disenfranchising 6 million trade unionists, disenfranchising charities and vulnerable people, and moving them away from voting in this country, rather than towards democratic process"

1691," In those years of conflictwhere so many Somalilanders had their lives under threat, and so many hundreds of thousands were displaced, both internally within Somaliland and externallythat dream and that vision of creating their own homeland once again and reestablishing those old territorial borders burned bright, and that is what they were able to achieve in 1991"
1692," Somaliland is not asking for a change to the boundaries, as they are very much what was there in 1960"
1693," One need only look to the other side of Africa, at the confederation between Senegal and Gambia, which was unwound in the late 1980s"
1694," DP World already invests in the port of Berbera, and the welcome investment from British International Investmentthe old Commonwealth Development Corporationamounts to hundreds of millions of pounds"
1695," The Government recognise the importance of Somaliland, and we are willing to invest hundreds of millions of pounds there, because we realise that it opens up so much of the horn of Africa to British goods and investment"
1696," Many steps have already been taken in municipal and devolved government to encourage the links between our great nations of the United Kingdom and Somaliland, but now is the time for the UK Government to take the leadfor the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office not to be shy, and not to think that policy is stuck in the 1960s"

1706,"I would like to thank the Minister on behalf of a number of leaseholders around the country, because our amendments asked for only 25 years and the Government have gone further with 30 years"
1707, Gentleman will have seen that in the net zero strategy we have set out a plan for an extra £90 billion of investment from the private sector
1708,"The Defective Premises Act has been in effect since 1972, so there is a significant body of case law that those wishing to bring an action, and indeed the courts, will be able to refer to, to determine whether a premises is defective and therefore whether an action should be successful"
1709," The new clause will be inserted into Part 5, after clause 137"
1710, The proposal to make developers pay £4 billion for cladding removal in buildings under 18 metres is unclear on how quickly developers will be asked to pay and what measures the Government will take if they refuse
1711, Does the Minister think it is right that social landlords have paid millions more than developers to fix the building safety scandal at the cost of delivering new social homes I hope that we will see urgent action to appease concerns raised by leaseholders and Members across the House and to allay genuine concerns that it is one rule for council and social landlords and another for the Governments developer friends

1713, Every single community is affected up and down the country; there are millions of leaseholders
1714," In some ways, it does not really matter what our opinions are in this place; what matters is what we deliver for those millions of leaseholders up and down the country, so that they do not face bankrupting bills and huge mental health issues"
1715,1 The Architects Act 1997 is amended as follows
1716," Friend is right a whole range of commitments were made, some of which will continue beyond the end of 2022"

1718," House buyers need to have confidence in the safety and quality of their homes, which is why the Scottish Government support the principle of the new homes ombudsman scheme proposed in part 5 of the Bill"

1724," Gentleman knows, the scheme in Wales will be administered by the Welsh Government, so may I take it and inform my constituents that new clause 3 will be the basis of the scheme that we see apply to Wales, where Labour is in government"
1725," Does he agree that there is a requirement to move with haste A constituent of mine who has contacted me is facing a bill of £25,000, with a demand for £5,000 by the end of this month, so the Government really need to move very quickly"
1726," As well as providing for the establishment of a building works agency, which we believe remains necessary if the Government are to ensure that the pace of remediation across the country is accelerated and that works are properly carried out  and certified, our new clause 3 seeks to provide the maximum legal protection possible for leaseholders facing potential costs to fix historic cladding and noncladding defects, irrespective of circumstance"
1727," Members for Stevenage and for Southampton, Itchen, does the same and we fully support it, as well as their new clauses 5 and 6"
1728," We will seek to divide on new clause 3 today, simply to reinforce to the other place the importance we attach to the issue of leaseholder protection, but we do want to work constructively with the Government on this matter in the period ahead, in the light of the change of tone and approach signalled by the Secretary of State last week"
1729," We are asking for the VAT to be scrapped, because when the Treasury puts forward £5 billion, £1 billion of it will be going back to the Treasury automatically; the frustration is understandable"
1730," Another example we give is how a previous defects Actthe Defective Premises Act 1972could be used, as it was for properties with prefabricated concrete"
1731," For example, I have a property in my constituency, Vista Towerone of the famous propertieswhere the remediation costs are £15 million for 73 flats"
1732," The leaseholders paid £200,000 for their flats, and their remediation costs are £212,000, so hon"
1733," The mortgage companies are losing money, and that was before the leaseholders got into paying over £300,000 for waking watch and all the other interim costs that have added to the bills"
1734," For that particular property, with the announcement that the Secretary of State made, leaseholders costs went from £200,000 down to £60,000"
1735," We are not there yet, but we are very close to getting there and supporting millions of constituents up and down the country"
1736, Lady is a doughty campaigner on behalf of her constituents in the Roundway and elsewhere
1737, The Bill Committee debated section 1 of the Defective Premises Act 1972 in significant detail; I recall that the hon

1739," At the moment, as I am sure the Minister knows, householders in some parts of the country cannot get any flood insurance if their property has been built after 2009"
1740,"3 million homes in the UK at risk of flooding, without any property flood resilience measures"
1741," Without positive action from the Government, tens of thousands more homes will be built without the protection they need"
1742," It was the result of two years of marathon work and a twoweek sprint of negotiations, following which the world can creditably say that we have kept within reach the goal of limiting global warming to 1"
1743,5 above preindustrial levels
1744, But to keep 1
1745,"5 alive, commitments must be translated into action"
1746,"As the Chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee knows, all countries have committed to come back to their 2030 emissionsreduction targets by 2022, if necessary"
1747," Of course, the G20 is responsible for 80% of global emissions and will have to lead the way"
1748," Does the COP President agree that the lesson is not that, as some in his party would say, we are moving too fast on green energy, but the opposite we are moving too slowly and our dependence on fossil fuels leaves us vulnerable The only way, therefore, to keep 1"
1749,5 alive and provide energy security is to go further and faster on the climate transition
1750,"Consumers looking at their energy bills will ask, If it is going so well, why are our bills rocketing and why are we so vulnerable We can keep 1"
1751,5 alive only if we have an energy policy that is fair at home and abroad
1752," Many of the fossil fuel companies have made billions as a result of soaring prices, yet the Government say we should not tax them further because they are struggling"
1753,"Our young people have led the fight for tougher climate change pledges, so the world at least does not breach 1"
1754,5 of warming
1755," To support their activism, Scotland recently hosted the UN Climate Change Conference of Youth ahead of COP26, has unveiled almost £1 million for a programme for young people in the climate conference and legacy activities, and has signed up to the UNICEF declaration on children, youth and climate change, along with countries such as Norway, the Netherlands and Peru"

1757,5 degrees Celsius remains achievable

1760,"That the draft Data Protection Act 2018 Amendment of Schedule 2 Exemptions Regulations 2022, which were laid before this House on 10 December 2021, be approved"
1761," Normally it would be the Chairman of the Committee who would be speaking in this debate on behalf of the Committee, but the hon"
1762," Dame Laura Cox, in her 2018 report on bullying and harassment of House staff, recommended that Members of Parliament should not be involved in adjudicating on their own colleagues accused of these very serious offences"
1763,"New clause 2 and amendment 1, which stand in my name and are kindly supported by the hon"
1764," That is exactly what happened at Wessex Foods in Lowestoft 11 years ago, in July 2011"
1765," I should therefore be grateful if the Minister gave serious consideration to accepting new clause 2 and amendment 1, so that the Building Act can be amended to provide for the protection of property"

1767, A British standard already exists that reduces falls by a staggering 60% British Standard 53951
1768," The Government will argue that our focus should be outcomebased rather  than legislating on method, but I might point to regulation 7 of the building regulations, on combustible materials, which is in itself descriptive and sets out how the industry must achieve that particular regulation"
1769," If the outcome that we are all aiming for is safety of stairs, then the status quo is simply not working, and hundreds of people are dying every year from something that could so easily be prevented I refer back to the 60% figure"
1770,"I rise to speak in support of new clauses 1, 2, 15, 16 and 23"
1771," Friend the Member for Sheffield South East Mr Betts,  and amendment 1, tabled by the hon"
1772," As he will no doubt be aware, concerns were raised that the plans for Ballymores proposed 51storey development in Cuba Street in my constituency included only a single fire escape for a building that would have been two and half times the height of Grenfell tower"
1773," Not only landlords of highrise blocks but social landlords and resident leaseholders need to do this, and the cost is estimated to be about £30 a year per flat"
1774," Less than a year before Grenfell, in August 2016, there was a very serious fire, less than 1 mile from where Grenfell Tower stands, at Shepherds Courtan 18storey blockin my constituency"
1775, Some 5
1776,"5 million of that particular type of faulty washerdryer were manufactured, and hundreds if not thousands of fires across the country, some obviously in highrise buildings, have been caused by that"
1777," Indeed, over half53%of all accidental dwelling fires are caused by electrical sources of ignition"
1778," I will first deal briefly with several of the nonGovernment amendments selected, before taking the opportunity to ask the Minister several specific questions relating to  Government new clause 19, new schedule 1 and various other amendments relating to special measures and protections against forfeiture"
1779, This directly relates to our previous debate on part 5
1780," No provisions prohibiting forfeiture would be necessary if the House had accepted any amendment, whether it be new clause 3, new clause 13 or potential forthcoming Government amendments, that provides sufficiently robust legal protection for leaseholders in all circumstances"
1781, Proposed new paragraph 9 is a new provision that provides for a financial management proposal
1782," 11, 12, 16 to 28, 31 and 32, 36, 40, 61, 63 and 70are consequential amendments that make changes relating to special measures due to the provisions now appearing in new schedule 1"
1783," Four technical amendments are consequential to amendment 1, which I introduced earlier, relating to the new homes ombudsman"
1784," Amendments 66 and 67 adjust the territorial extent of the provisions about the new homes ombudsman scheme now that that the scheme will operate across Great Britain, and territorial extent issues are also dealt with in new schedule 2, which contains a consequential amendment related to the new homes ombudsman"
1785," Amendment 64 provides that the consequential amendments in schedule 5 relating to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967an Act we all know welland the Freedom of Information Act 2000 extend to all of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland"
1786, That left them facing bills for tens of thousands of pounds
1787, We know that is a problem in hundreds of buildings
1788,"It is nearly five years since the tragic events at Grenfell Tower, yet thousands of my constituents in Salford and Eccles still live in fear"
1789, Prospective suppliers bidding for contracts above £5 million a year must now have committed to the Governments target of net zero by 2050 and have published a carbon reduction plan
1790," Certainly, the provision of funds for cladding removal, the initial move on the ACM cladding, the £1 billion and the extension of the building safety fund to £5 billion have all been welcome"
1791," They were horrified to be told that FirstPort intends to recover the estimated £4,912,000 for repairs from the leaseholders if the application to the building safety fund is not successful"
1792," That will mean that constituents such as the single working mother who paid £60,000 for a 25% share of her property will be lumbered with a repair bill of £110,000"
1793," I have more than 1,000 constituents living in dangerous homes"
1794, It is time to enact in practice provisions that the House of Commons passed in lawineffectivelyin 2002
1795," Will he support me in asking the Government to get together with the technical sides of the insurance companies and the Competition and Markets Authority to get those insurance premiums back down to what they were before so that leaseholders may pay £300 a year to insure a building they do not own rather than £3,000 a year"
1796," That has been the case since August 2016 when there was a very serious fire at Shepherds Court in my constituency, which I spoke about earlier today"
1797," We have now had a recent announcement from the new Secretary of StateI hope I have understood this correctlythat there will be a request to private developers to provide £4 billion, with a veiled threat of enforcing that in some as yet unspecified way, in order to deal with buildings between 11 and 18 metres"
1798,I start by paying tribute to the many hundreds of Vauxhall residents who have contacted me in my short two years as Member of Parliament for Vauxhall
1799," At every stage of my continued efforts on behalf of Vauxhall leaseholders going through that anguish and uncertainty over the last two years, the Bill has been held up by the Government as the solution that would finally bring an end to this crisis"
1800, Where does that leave the millions of leaseholders caught up at various points along the way of that lengthy scandal What does the Bill do to empower leaseholders who had their assessment before the recent changes in Government policy and believe that unnecessary work has been recommended for their building Where is the help for leaseholders whose flats are unsellable until that remediation work is complete but who have been told that they will have to wait many years They are trapped
1801," As I suggested on Report, it is not preempting the Grenfell Tower inquirys conclusions to state that the horror of that dreadful June night in 2017 was the product not only of pernicious industry practice but of state failure a failure that involved successive Governments presiding over a deficient regulatory regime, and a failure to act on repeated and clear warnings about the potentially lethal consequences of that fact"
1802," When we started our campaign about 18 months ago, the Governments original offer was around £20 million to deal with these issues"
1803," After the statement from the Secretary of State last week, we are now on course to have more than £9 billion of Government support, with probably another £100 million for waking watch, alarms and a variety of other issues"
1804," Tonight, millions of leaseholders up and down the country, many with huge mental health issues and facing massive financial ruin, have hope"
1805, That hope encourages us to believe that we may finally come to a position where we can resolve things for those millions of leaseholders
1806," At Vista Tower in my constituency, which has more than £15 millionworth of remediation costs, the fire breaks are missing"
1807," With all the technical details, that campaign has demonstrated how complicated this issue is and the many millions of people and tens of thousands of buildings it affects in many different ways"
1808," Will the Government be prepared to provide support so that those leaseholders can take action against the original developers, or will the Government take the action on their behalf, because a lot of these leaseholders have been going through this for a number of years and no longer have the mental resilience or ability to take these fights on and take legal actions for the next five or 10 years in the courts Will the Minister provide further support to those leaseholders Will he agree to continue to meet and work with me so that we can ensure that leaseholders are not held responsible and they are the innocent parties throughout this crisis"
1809," In a modern liberal democracy, living in a home where you feel safe should be a basic human right, but sadly, for thousands of people up and down our country, this most reasonable of expectations does not tally with their current experience"
1810," This Bill is going to right that wrong by replacing an outdated building system with one that is attuned not just to where we are in 2021 but to how we protect people in 2031, 2041 and for many years beyond"
1811, Member for Vauxhall Florence Eshalomi; and many others who have worked so very hard to on behalf of their constituents to make sure that their concerns are addressed
1812,"I shall speak to Opposition new clause 3 and to the amendments that, although they will not be pressed to a vote this evening, would protect leaseholders from the costs of not only cladding removal, but the remediation of noncladding defects"
1813," It seems to me that someone who has profited from, for example, charging a building in my constituency an insurance premium of £700,000 in total, which has never come down, has some big questions to answer"
1814," First, around half of the buildings in my constituency that have difficulties associated with them have noncladdingrelated problems"
1815," Indeed, in Queens Wharf in Reading town centre, the building owners estimate that nearly £1 million of work needs to be carried out"
1816,"The principle that leaseholders should not have to pay for issues that are not their responsibility, as they bought properties in good faith, was first established in the Select Committee report in July 2018"
1817, Members who have been here long enough will remember that I took the Mesothelioma Act 2014 through this House
1818," Originally, we gave the victims 80% of the compensation that they would have got through the courts"
1819," Eventually, we gave them 100%"
1820," When we come to part 5, Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope to catch your eye again"
1821, This new clause amends Part XVI of the Housing Act 1985 originally enacted as the Housing Defects Act 1984 to empower the government and local authorities to designate dwellings with cladding and fire safety defects as defective and to provide grant support for remediation
1822, It places a timelimited duty on the Secretary of State to consider making designations under Part XVI of the Housing Act 1985 to provide funding for cladding and fire safety remediation and for Parliament to approve the plans for doing so
1823, Removing subsection 5 removes the material risk a court may construe clause 128 in a way that means it has no practical benefit and will lead to years of costly litigation for leaseholders
1824," This is the first group of amendments, new clauses and new schedules that relates to part 5 of the Bill"
1825, Members should not make general speeches about how they feel about the Bill at this point; this part of the proceedings very specifically relates to part 5
1826," Gentleman, suggest to the Government that between now and the House of Lords they consider taking a right to take the potential claims by the landlords on behalf of leaseholders into a public agency which can make a public claim against the developers, builders, architects, surveyors, building specification and building controllers, so that money can be brought back from those who were responsible, not the innocent leaseholders who are not"
1827," I have no intention of seeking to reprise them this afternoon, but before I turn to part 5 of the Bill and the consideration of the amendments related to it, I feel it is incumbent on me briefly to restate why we believe this legislation is so important"
1828," To the extent that the Bill delivers on the recommendations of Dame Judiths report, we remain supportive of it and want to see a version of it on the statute book as soon as possible, given that four and a half years have elapsed since the Grenfell tragedy; however, the House knows we have serious concerns about what is missing from the Bill, and particularly its failure as drafted to provide robust legal protection for leaseholders facing ruinous costsa point already made by several hon"
1829," The Minister should note that, with some minor tweaks, our new clause 3 would achieve that"
1830," In fairness to the Government and the Minister, we now have over £9 billion of Government support put forward with other funds on top, so it would be churlish of us, with the very technical amendments I am going to speak to shortly, to try to hold the Government to these specific issues"
1831, New clause 21 makes sure that the devolved Administrations are not restricted from bringing forward legislation to alter the ombudsmans statutory functions in relation to that territorys future by disapplying a restriction in the Government of Wales Act 2006
1832," That is why we have proposed adding section 4B4 to the Limitation Act 1980 through clause 128, which will ensure that there is always a minimum amount of time to lodge a claim under section 1 of the Defective Premises Act for buildings whose limitation periods will be revived for a very short period of time"
1833," That means that those in any buildings completed between mid1992 and mid1993 will always have one full year in which to lodge their claim, once this Bill and its provisions apply"
1834," Friend the Member for Worthing West Sir Peter Bottomley, referred to the Defective Premises Act 1972"
1835," I would say to him that quite apart from the body of case law that exists with respect to the 1972 Act, and quite apart from the fact that even if a company has become defunct directors can still be held liable for the decisions made, as it were, on their watch, the challenges that he has described are the sorts of things that we will want to discuss in this place and in the other place, across parties, to ensure that such challenges are addressed"
1836, That means that the EU will now have a 25% price advantage over UK steel and aluminium exports to the US
1837,"At the start of last month, I wrote to the Secretary of State about those steel tariffs, which have been in place since 2018 and have already done great damage"
1838," In 2017, exports of steel and aluminium to the United States were more than 350,000 tonnes"
1839," The UK accounts for less than 1% of US steel and aluminium imports in volume terms, so UK imports do not affect the viability or the national security of the US steel or aluminium industries"
1840," It supplies thousands of subframes every day to motor  manufacturers worldwide, but it has outlined to me concerns that have been raised with it by European companies about the rules of origin and potential tariffs on goods supplied from the UK"
1841,"In her answer to the urgent question, the Minister mentioned the £286 million of aid that we are giving to Afghanistan"
1842," The amount has been doubled after being halved the previous year, which is fine, but in her response to another urgent question last week, the Minister confirmed that only half that money£145 millionhad actually been disbursed"
1843,"In addition to British Council staff, many of us have thousands of constituentsin my case, up to 150who have relatives and friends who have worked for the British in Afghanistan and who are in terrible need of resettlement to this country"
1844," That included over 8,000 British nationals, and close to 5,000 Afghans who loyally served the UKincluding British Council employeesalong with their dependants"
1845," We are coordinating closely with international partners, and have doubled our aid to Afghanistan for this financial year to £286 million, which will be used to provide the vital humanitarian assistance that will save lives this winter"
1846," As I set out earlier, we have doubled our aid for Afghanistan for this financial year to £286 million, which will be essential to providing humanitarian assistance for those most in need"
1847," The Government have already evacuated thousands of women and girlsfor instance, female judges, womens rights activists and a girls football team"
1848," We have doubled the aid for this financial year to £286 million, which will be used to ensure that we get that humanitarian assistance to those on the ground"
1849, More than 20 million people are facing the prospect of starvation in Afghanistan and the situation could not be more urgent
1850," In relation to the Ministers earlier responses, could she tell the House how much of the £286 million of aid promised in this financial year has been disbursed so far"
1851,"For every £490 of Brexit damage, CPTPP should recover about £8 of it, but that is at risk if the UK patent attorneys membership of the European Patent Organisation is undermined or removed"
1852, He is right it is an £8
1853,4 trillion market that we are opening up
1854," Friend is absolutely right; the pay for people working in those sectors is about 50% higher than the UK average, so the more jobs we can create in those growth sectors, the better"
1855,"9% of the businesses in his constituency that export will benefit from CPTPP, and I look forward to the day when he welcomes that"

1858," Friend said in his speech today, 80% of crime that involves cautions or convictions involves repeat offences"
1859," Good intentions and strategies need to be backed up by Government investment, and nearly £900 million of additional funding is being put in over the next three years, which brings the total up to £3 billion"
1860," With more than 2,000 bed spaces, it is important for there to be a comprehensive drugs strategy for the approved premises estate"
1861," Members may be aware, around 80% of crime that receives a caution or conviction is committed by a repeat offender"
1862," Indeed, Dame Carol Blacks review of drugs estimated that the total cost of harms related to illicit drug use in England was more than £19 billion in 201718"
1863," Drugrelated crime was the main driver of the total costs, with recorded offences committed in England by drug users amounting to £9"
1864,3 billion in that period
1865," HMPPS estimates that when it implements the change in testing, it will cost approximately £1"
1866,2 million per year to carry out the enhanced testing regime with residents of approved premises
1867," The current annual budget for drug testing in approved premises is £350,000, so the implementation of this Bill would see an increase of some £850,000"
1868," However, it is worth bearing it in mind that the Ministry of Justice has indicated that it has evidence that shows that drug treatment provides a return to society of £4 for every £1 that is invested, and that increases to a return to society of £21 over a period of 10 years"
1869," Let us look at what the Mayor of London is doing an extra 1,300 police officers and £70 million for opportunities for disadvantaged young people"

1873," There has been a 12% drop in inmates enrolling in drug and alcohol courses over the last four years, with fewer offenders taking these programmes"
1874, And what of the Justice Secretarys flagship programme of introducing £1 million Xray scanners in all mens prisons They are detecting only a quarter of the number of contraband items being found in manual checks by prison officers
1875," The perilous state of our prisons means that a third of adults released  from custody go on to reoffend within a year, costing the taxpayer £18 billion and meaning that we are less safe on our streets"
1876," Under clause 1 of the Bill, approved premises managers can authorised assisted premises staff to ask for and require a urine sample from any resident, rather than an oral fluid testa provision already in place elsewhere in the system"
1877, I was glad to hear reassurances during the Bill Committee that clause 1 also ensures that the first step will be to provide guidance and assistance for those found to have drugs or other illicit substances in their bodies
1878," It builds on the recommendations of the prisons and probation ombudsman, which in 2017 called for more effective drug testing practices and better staff guidance to identify and address the risks associated with substance misuse"
1879, The strategy is underpinned with total investment of £3 billion in combating drugs over the next three years

1892, A further £27 million is being allocated to bring the misuse of waking watches to an end
1893," That is on top of the current £35 million fund, which is already being used for 323 buildings and nearly 25,000 leasehold homes"

2073," VAT is charged at 5% on energy and if people are spending more of their disposable income on energy and less on issues that are taxed at the full rate, the Exchequer gets less money rather than more, so it is a net cost to the Exchequer"

2111," This is a country where there is great poverty, but what is worse than the fact that millions of people are working themselves into an early grave through mental illness because they fear they cannot afford to feed their children, is that there are many people in this country for whom the story is the complete opposite"
2112," As I said in this House last week, the most alarming statistic to me is that 171 of the richest people in Britain could afford to cover every single penny the Government have spent in responding to covidmore than £400 billion"

3092,South Yorkshire will receive a share of the £5
3093,7 billion for transport for the region
3094, We are investing £2
3095,7 billion of capital funding to improve provision for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities
3096, That funding represents a significant investment in high needs provision and will help to deliver tens of thousands  of new places for some of the most vulnerable children in our country
3097," Over the next three years, we will provide £259 million to expand the number of places available in secure and open residential childrens homes"
3098," We promised to recruit an extra 20,000 police officers in 202223 and we are putting an extra £540 million into recruiting a further 8,000 additional police officers"
3099, We are allocating £42 million for new crime and drugs programmes
3100," The covid pandemic has had a massive impact on this, so we are making an extra £2"
3101,2 billion available to manage the increased number of offenders being brought to justice and to reduce backlogs in criminal courts
3102," There will be an extra 20,000 prison places, which builds on the additional 18,000 prison places that we announced at the last spending review, plus a further 2,000 temporary places"
3103, This Budget will provide billions of pounds to deliver the public services that the British people deserve
3104, The Budget is a clear statement of intent worldclass public services backed by £150 billion a year in cash terms
3105,"I am pleased that the Minister mentioned the opportunity to provide eight additional rebuilds of hospitals, because Stepping Hill Hospital has served the people of Stockport and surrounding areas well since it was built in 1905"
3106," However, all hospital buildings reach the end of their useful lives and, with a £40 million maintenance bill, that one certainly has"
3107," We have also provided £180 million in covid loan schemes to support businesses in Crawley and, as he knows, Crawley has already received £21 million through the towns fund"
3108," I reassure him that the Department for Transport and Transport Scotland are discussing the options to extend the railway, and, as I think he knows, the £350 million Borderlands inclusive growth deal includes up to £5 million to assess feasibility"
3109,"First, may I put on record my thanks to the Chancellor for announcing that Radcliffe will receive £20 million from the levellingup fund to regenerate the town centre, with new leisure facilities and a space for adult learning and new business Following that extra funding and the previously announced new high school for Radcliffe, does the Minister agree that the Government are committed to creating new opportunities for young people so that they have the best chance to get on in life and fulfil their potential"
3110," Friend, because his constituency is indeed receiving £20 million from the levellingup fund to deliver a new civic hub in Radcliffe, which will improve access to adult education while freeing up vital space for a new secondary school"
3111," Gentleman recall that we set out to try to simplify the code of conduct Does he think we are succeeding in simplifying Or, by adding more, are we perhaps being drawn dangerously into a zerosum game, where rules beget rules and more rules beget more rules in an effort to try to clarify, and in fact making it more complicated I particularly draw attention to section 8 of the report, on Training, advice and promotion"
3112,"Regarding Russia, when I was in Bosnia as part of the United Nations protection force, a Russian man called Victor Andreev was very much part of the headquarters"
3113," It seems that one of the problems, which has got worse since  my first visit in 2003 and my second in 2013, is that much as we would want to create a multiethnic, multidenominational constitution and structure, a lot of peoples daily lives are spent in a separate silo"
3114,"I was a young captain in 1997, when I deployed on my very first tour to Bosnia"
3115," I also spent time in Banja Luka, which was then the headquarters of the multinational division that was entrusted with enforcing the peace and the Dayton agreement"
3116," An estimated 100,000 people were killed, 80% of whom were Bosniaks"
3117," In July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces killed as many as 8,000 Bosniak men and boys from the town of Srebrenica"
3118," and gallant Friend the Member for Beckenham Bob Stewart deployed in 1992, in the act of peacemaking"
3119, I deployed in 1997
3120," Why Because Dodiks rhetoric is separatist, and he has vowed to sever the legal and tax systems and the army in the Serbrun half of the country"
3121, Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton said that we are repeating the same mistakes as we did in the early 1990s
3122," It is stoking the ethnic tensions and encouraging the separatists and the breakup of the state, because I imagine Putin regards it as in his national interest to see 1"
3123,8 million Bosnian refugees flooding into Europe when western Europe is already facing a refugee crisis
3124," I agree with the suggestion that we should support the current headquarters in Bosnia with NATO troops, or even troops of support of the EU; it does not really matter, but an enhanced British presence in the headquarters and possibly on the ground is necessary to give us the eyes and the ears that we need"
3125, I deployed in 1997 to do peace enforcement; I think we now need to do political enforcement
3126," As we all know, in 1995 Srebrenica experienced a genocide on a scale not seen in Europe since the second world war"
3127," Eight thousand Muslim men and boys were murdered, women were raped, children were slain in front of their parents, and bodies were pushed into mass graves with the use of bulldozers"
3128, The Srebrenica massacre of 1995 was an atrocity
3129, The genocide of thousands of Muslim men and boysthe most horrific of eventsis now being dismissed and genocidedenial sentiments are rising among Republika Srpska factions
3130," We must help them to get back to the pre1992 situation, when everyone worked together regardless of religion or ethnicity"
3131," Member for Strangford Jim Shannon mentioned, we need to reform annexe 4 of the constitution to ensure that there is democratic accountability, and to give that confidence to people in the region and area"
3132, Member for Strangford Jim Shannon that he  had changed his position during the debates on the Irish question we had here in the 1990s and into the 2000s
3133,"As I mentioned, I sat through those debates and questions in the 1990s, and I am not prepared to sit through more months and years of prevarication"
3134," But, to this day, not far away from where we stand, there are many people, and many countries backing people, who do deny what happened in 1995"
3135," More than 8,000 Muslim men and boys were massacred, women were systematically raped and the lives of more than 100,000 people were taken in a war led by greed and inhumanity"
3136," It would, in effect, enshrine the results of 1990s ethnic cleansing"
3137," In the last few years, Putin has delivered semi automatic weapons to Republika Srpska2,500 to be exact, that we know of"
3138," We know how to counter Russias disinformation and we should be doing more of it, so I urge the Minister to consider establishing a NATO counterdisinformation capability at NATO headquarters in Sarajevo"
3139," As in the 1990s, bloodshed would displace thousands of people, and we would need to respond with boots on the ground"
3140," My interest in that part of the world arises from the fact that, from 2000 to 2002, I worked with the United Nations mission in Kosovo after the NATO bombing of the former Yugoslavia"
3141," Prior to 2000, the Serbians had come into Kosovo; I saw at first hand some of the atrocities that had been carried out by the Serbian Government in Kosovo"
3142," After I came into Parliament in 2010, I got interested in Srebrenica in particular and founded the group with a Conservative Member"
3143," Many of us will remember seeing images of the war in Bosnia during the 1990s, watching the horror of the footage of Sarajevo under siege and people being held in concentration camps, and slowly learning about the reports of the atrocities committed across Bosnia that culminated in genocide"
3144, The APPG was set up in 2013 with the purpose of commemorating Srebrenica and reminding us of those horrors
3145," We cannot return to the violence and destruction of the 1990s, so it is important for the United Kingdom to start working together with our European partners and with others in the world to ensure that they do not happen again"
3146," Bosnia has seen ongoing political violence since the early 1990s, and long before the Bosnian war of 1995"
3147," First, Bosnia and Herzegovina is faced with thousands of migrants and asylum seekers wanting somewhere to live"
3148," However, in this case, in 201819 only 1,223 of the 2,865 reported cases of domestic violence resulted in a court decisionthose figures worry me, as this is less than half"
3149," Therefore, I suspectI do not have any evidential base to prove this, but I do not think I am far wrongthat many hundreds, if not thousands, more women are probably suffering at the hands of abusers but are too frightened to report it, given the ongoing human rights abuses"
3150," Although more than 8,000 people died, there are nowhere near that many graves there, because a lot of the remains have not been found"
3151," When we visit children in our own constituency, we might have helped their parents as asylum seekers and refugees in the late 1990s"
3152," In the light of the comparison that he is making, it is worth stressing that there are similarities with the Good Friday agreement, which did lock in identity back in 1998, and to some extent, has not evolved, as Dayton also has not"
3153," The Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocity Prevention Act 2018 commits the US Government to pursuing a Governmentwide strategy to identify, prevent and respond to atrocity risk"
3154, I visited in 2000 as a young undergraduate doing some charity work
3155, I am talking about the 1
3156,"8 million Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina who will surely find their way in that situation towards other parts of Europe and towards our own shores,  rather than being able to build their current and future lives in their own country"
3157," I therefore pay tribute to all those across the whole region who have done so much to maintain peace since 1995, and I defer to the position of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office"
3158," She took me to the Government headquarters, and I was making polite conversation with her"
3159, I asked her simply what the civil war in the early 1990s meant for her
3160," It was estimated that some 23,000 women, children and elderly people were put on buses and driven to Muslimcontrolled territory, while, as others have said, 8,000plus battleage men were detained and killed"
3161, We need to uphold the provisions of the Dayton peace agreement that was signed in November 1995
3162," Friend for sharing that because I remember visiting the Srebrenica memorial in 2015, and two Serbian young men driving past in their car with music blaring, throwing bottles of urine into the memorial"
3163," Does he agree that it is vital that as many Members of this House as possible visit and learn, because it is only through seeing the visceral pain that was there in 2015, and is there now, that we can truly understand how much of a tinderbox Bosnia is"
3164," It started doing so in both the 2015 and 2017 Parliaments, but the general elections cut short that work"
3165," On the substance, we are recommending the following first, an outright ban on any Member acting as a paid parliamentary adviser, consultant or strategist, which was a recommendation of the 2018 Committee on Standards in Public Life report on Members outside interests; secondly, the introduction of a new requirement that a Member must have a written contract for any outside work that makes it explicit that their duties cannot include lobbying Ministers, Members or public officials, or providing advice about how to lobby or influence Parliament, and that their employer will give them an undertaking not to ask them to do so; and thirdly, clarification of the criteria for the serious wrong exemption in the lobbying rules, to make clearer the risks of conflicts of interest and to put an end to this being used as a loophole"
3166,"On the issue of natural justice and a fair hearing, as I have said several times recently, all Members of the House, because of article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689, are treated differently from every other citizen in the country"
3167," I welcome the consultation, but in regard to paragraphs 196, 243 and 244 of the report, will the Chairman accept that there must be full and proper consultation before any judicial figure is appointed, and therefore before his or her report comes about Otherwise, we will have a prejudgment on the question of fairness, article 6 and all that goes with it and the issue of a fair trial with Members"
3168," In 95% or 98% of referrals, when the Committee makes its decision, the Member accepts it and we move forward, but on the rare occasions when the Member feels badly done by, there should be, as in other organisations, a right of appeal to a completely independent organisation"
3169," It seems illogical to me that two Members of the House, one of whom is a Minister, could be wined and dined at Wimbledon on a ticket that costs £2,500, then the Minister does not have to register that with the House and never has to register its value, even though they might be the Minister who makes decisions about tennis funding in the UK, whereas the Member who is not a Minister has to register it within 28 days"
3170,I deployed in September 1992 with 900 men and some women to save lives
3171," We managed to save quite a number of people, for example in April 1993 we led on pulling out about 2,000 people from Srebrenica three years before the disaster of July 1995, but we failed to save many others, so, in my view, it was not a success"
3172," It ground on until that awful genocide of Srebrenica in July 1995, when 8,372 men and boys were murdered by the Bosnian Serb armyby the way, the same Bosnian Serb army that might want to split away"
3173," Paddy told me a story about having dinner with Franjo Tuman, the President of Croatia, in May 1995 at the Guildhall in London"
3174," Paddy said to Tuman, How do you see the future of Bosnia in 10 years time Tuman grabbed a menu, drew a map of Bosnia and divided it in half half Serb, half Croat"
3175," Everyone is a south Slav, but by religion they are 30% Serb, 15% Croat and over 50% Bosnian Muslim1"
3176,8 million people
3177," Bosnia matters to us, because if the Croats and the Serbs divide the country in half, guess what will happen to 1"
3178,8 million people
3179, She called on allies to contribute personnel to the NATO headquarters in Sarajevo and to support work to counter disinformation and strengthen defence reform
3180," I met the Elnos Group and its UK partner Emico, which recently won a contract to deliver 13 prefabricated substations for HS2 and is planning to bid for more"
3181," In the four quarters to the end of the first quarter of 2021, total trade in goods and services was worth £117 millionan increase of 77% or £51 million on the previous year"
3182," In a nutshell, although in courts, tribunals or professional disciplinary arrangements, any person in the land could  apply for judicial review where there had been a failure to comply with such procedures, that does not apply because of parliamentary privilege and article 9 of the Bill of Rights"
3183," By the final meeting, only 50% of the membership had attended all three meetings, and four of the 11 members who attended that meeting had not attended the meeting in which the evidence of my right hon"
3184, Gentleman agree that under the rules paid advocacy has been banned from this House since 1695 Why do this Government appear to be bending the rules when it suits them
3185," In 2012, the House recognised the need for a whistleblowing provision to make it clear that in exceptional cases, if there were some serious wrong, a Member could approach the responsible Minister or public official, even if to do so might incidentally benefit a paying client"
3186,"If any Member, regardless of their political affiliation, is involved in paid advocacy to the tune of £100,000 per year, I would expect the House and the Committee to come to the same conclusionfor a Member from any political party and of any affiliation"
3187, We only have an hour and a half to discuss this
3188, It turns the clock back to before 1695
3189," The Member repeatedly, over a sustained period, lobbied officials and Ministers on behalf of his paying clients, Randox and Lynns Country Foods, from whom he was receiving more than £9,000 a month, as he still is"
3190," In some shape or form, it has been banned since 1695 and expressly so since  cash for questions, which brought this House into terrible disrepute in the 1990s"
3191," We would be dismantling the rule on paid advocacy, which has been around in some shape or form since 1695"
3192, It estimates that we will  need 10 GW of nuclear power by 2035
3193," It is not in dispute that the proposed model will lower the cost of capital on nuclear projectsI fully accept thatand it is also not in dispute that it would lower overall costs, although Conservative Members take issue with the frankly heroic assumptions that underpin the claimed £30 billion to £80 billion in longterm savings visvis coalfired financed projects"
3194," The 2015 Committee on Standards report on The Standards System in the House of Commons noted that the provisions relating to the panel had never been invoked, questioned why the investigatory panel was necessary and recommended that the provisions be reviewed"
3195,"The Leader of the House is utterly detached from the reality of most working MPs in the House, so let me inform him that most of us do not need to get paid £100,000 to do the job we are already paid for"
3196, The introduction of a House of Commons Standards Commissioner in 1995 and the Standards Committee in 2013 were key features of strengthening the system
3197, Members and the public will remember cash for questions and those Tory scandals of the 1990s
3198," Friend the Member for Harwich and North Essex Sir Bernard Jenkin said, the 2003 recommendation of the Committee on Standards in Public Life is worth looking at"
3199, I expected maybe to come to a debate that would be the usual suspects speaking on behalf of one of their palsbut not today
3200," Why do we not get the executive committee of the 1922 Committee to replace the whole of the judicial system across the UK If a Conservative supporter is found guilty of any offence, why do we not get a committee set up to reconsider that verdict and have a look at it once again That is the type of realm of possibility we are getting into with this"
3201, Member for North Shropshire Mr Paterson broke multiple rules when he lobbied the Government on behalf of Randox and Lynns Country Foods
3202," If the Leader of the House wants us to look at how we approach these things in future, he should bring forward a debate, not just 90 minutes where he took up half the time, because nobody has an opportunity to get in and say anything"
3203,1212 for the purposes of Standing Order No
3204,1212 for the purposes of Standing Order No
3205," Friend the Member for Harwich and North Essex Sir Bernard Jenkin said, the 2003 recommendation of the Committee on Standards in Public Life is worth looking at"
3206," Does he recognise that someone who sold 1 million copies of a single in the 1990s typically saw their single reach the top 25 singles of the year, whereas about 1,700 different artists had more than 1 million streams last year He is right that there is a lot of streaming, but it is being shared so much more widely, so is it not inevitable that many people will receive less"
3207," Some eight out of 10 artists earn less than £200 year from streaming, which is not acceptable"
3208," One million streams sounds like an awful lot, but, in comparison to CD sales, it is not very much in terms of revenue generated for rights holders from digital service providers"
3209, The fact that the Government were able to find £2 billion for the  cultural recovery fund and bring in schemes such as the live events reinsurance scheme has kept the industry going
3210," Streaming has increased steadily, but between 2016 and 2019figures that come from the International Property Offices survey of creative industries earningsartists remuneration has gone up by 46%, whereas revenue to the labels has only gone up by 31%"
3211," However, in the Spanish system, about 23% of the revenue goes on administrative costs"
3212," The Committee pointed out that CDs cost tuppencehapenny to produce, and therefore it cost virtually nothing to make millions of them, and yet they were sold for a vast amount£10 or more"
3213," About 40% of that revenue goes into marketing and AR, which identifies artists and finds them"
3214," However, 26% of the market for releases is now held by the small independent sector"
3215," If a label that is signing an artist and making an initial investment of tens of millions of pounds has the knowledge that they and the artist have reached a contractual agreement that will extend and that will allow that money to be recouped over a lengthy period, that does give certainty"
3216," For example, the NHS has given ambulance trusts an extra £55 million to boost staff numbers this winter; there is nearly half a billion to fund an enhanced discharge programme; and we have measures to reduce pressure on accident and emergency departments, reduce waiting times and improve patient flow"
3217," One of our main defences is, of course, our vaccination programmes, and we are expanding our booster programme, which hit the milestone of 19 million doses yesterday, along with delivering the largest flu vaccination programme in UK history"
3218," Yesterday, we announced how we will be buying a total of 114 million additional Pfizer and Moderna doses for 2022 and 2023, which will futureproof our Great British vaccination effort and make sure we can protect even more people in the years ahead"
3219," Today, I am pleased to update the House on the £700 million fund that we announced in September for elective recovery"
3220," This includes £112 million for the northeast and Yorkshire, £131 million for the midlands and  £97 million for the northwest"
3221, At least £330 million will be invested in the NHS estate and a further £250 million will be spent on digital initiatives that aid elective recovery
3222," Over £600 million from this fund has already been committed to approved bids, such as for new wards at University Hospitals Birmingham, a new South Mersey elective hub and a new, modular unit in Castle Hill Hospital in Hull"
3223, It is part of £5
3224,"4 billion that we have announced to support the NHS response to the pandemic in the second half of the year and it builds on the work done ahead of last winter, where we invested £450 million to upgrade AE facilities in over 120 separate trusts, to boost capacity"
3225," It was volume 2 of their famous vinyl album, if I recall correctly"
3226," Friend the Member for East Yorkshire supported in the mid2000s, and that is why it is 70 years rather than 50 years"
3227," On iTunes, it is 0"
3228," Apple Music is a little more generous, with 0"
3229, They have said that 82% of professional musicians have made £200 per year less from streaming
3230," This is totally different from the 1990s, when someone who did sell massive amounts of singles got real rewards"
3231," We are coming into the Christmas season, and someone who is lucky enough to have had a Christmas hit in the 1970s or 1980sthere have not been so many recentlywill hit the jackpot, because their song will get played again and again and go right to the top of the steaming charts"
3232,"I was waiting patiently for my colleague, the third member of MP4, to get to his feet today"
3233, Gentleman that he is the best drummer in MP4
3234," It is important that we pay tribute to his talent, as seen in his solo work and in MP4, of which there are several members here today and which has brought much entertainment both inside and outside the House"
3235," The 1960s gave us some of the greatest bands, but they also gave us the sharp managers who invented new ways to rip off talented and often workingclass youngsters"
3236," It is the Houses duty to modernise the law to reflect the reality of the music industry and challenge the status quo whereby most streaming incomean estimated 55% of itends up in the pockets of record labels, streaming platforms and digital giants while 15% goes to artists and publishers"
3237," When an original music workor lyrics accompanying musicis  created, the composer or composers of that work have rights under the 1988 Act to control exploitation of that work"
3238," However, it is suggested that about eight out of 10 performers earn less than £200 a year from music streaming"
3239," However, while performers are entitled to equitable remuneration for performances for radio, television and other channels, they are not in respect of music streaming due to the exceptions set out in the 1988 Act"
3240, The UK music industry contributed £5
3241,"8 billion to the UK economy in 2019, which was an 11% increase on the prior year"
3242," Employment in the industry hit an alltime high in 2019, at 197,000 people, which was an increase of 3% on the prior year"
3243, The total export revenue of the music industry was £2
3244,"9 billion in 2019, which was an increase of about 9% on the prior year"
3245," Gentleman will have read the IPOs report, so he will have seen the chart showing that at the end of 2015, about 16,000 artists made up 90% of Spotifys streams"
3246," By the second quarter of last year, that number had gone up to 43,000, so the market is much more fragmented"
3247," Gentleman makes a great deal of how little an artist receives for 1 million streams, but in fact, 1 billion streams is not that much"
3248," To give an example, Mabel, one of our most successful upandcoming artists achieved more than 4 billion streams"
3249," The income from 1 million streams is equivalent to the income from 1,000 CD sales"
3250," When I asked, Could you fill a venue here in London he said, I could halffill one in London, but I could fill 10 venues in Los Angeles"
3251," If we look at the data, we see that, at 31%, live performance is the main revenue stream"
3252," Then there is teaching of music at 9%, audio streaming royalties at 6%, physical sales at 5%, digital sales at 5%, sessional orchestral work at 5%, broadcasts at 5%, public performances at 4%, commissions for stage at 3%, merchandise at 3%, video streaming royalties at 3%, and a whole raft of others"
3253," At the start, the streaming service takes its cut, which is typically around 30%, although there is no industry standard, and the rest is split among all the other parties back down the supply chain"
3254, Today is also the anniversary of the release in 1984 of Band Aids Do they know its Christmas
3255," I am old enough to recall Tim, now Lord, ClementJoness Live Music Bill in another place, testing parliamentary support on more than one occasion before the then Government were evidentially satisfied that they could support a version of the Bill becoming the landmark Live Music Act 2012"
3256, In 201819precovidthe UK music industry contributed £5
3257,"8 billion to the UK economy, up 11% from 2018"
3258," In 2019, prepandemic this is quite interestingthe median reported income for musicians currently signed to major record companies was £51,000, for musicians signed to independent record labels it was £20,000, and for selfreleasing artists it was £13,000"
3259," Sadly, the Music creators earnings in the digital era report found no evidence that there was ever a time when recorded music was the basis of substantial income for most musicians, even in the 1990s when revenues in the music industry were higher"
3260," On behalf of the campaigners and the many other voices across the country, and given the support for the Bill on both sides of the House, I ask the Government to allow it to be considered in more detail at a future date"
3261," My parents and grandparents were lucky enough to witness the British invasion when, in the mid1960s, rock and pop acts of the United Kingdom penetrated the shores of the United States and flooded the music industry"
3262," Screened on Disney Plus, the eighthour documentary covers the making of the Beatles 1970 album Let It Be"
3263," It is unbelievable that sitting alone in a studio, playing a great selection of songssometimes, depending how they were scheduledand broadcasting to thousands, or hundreds, depending on the size of the radio station, is a job people get paid for"
3264," I love their workPhil Collins is a genius, from his work with Genesis to his great solo albums of the 1980s and 1990s"
3265, The days of hopping on the bus into town to spend our pocket money on the latest 7inch single are long gone
3266," There is a temptation to think that every music label is some big corporate beast with millions of pounds sloshing around, but that is simply not the case"
3267," Well, that came all the way to New Zealand, and it was great to be able to sing the likes of U2 as a 15yearold"
3268," I think Members across the House will be staggered to know that the chairman and chief executive officer of one of the three major corporations that dominate the market of recorded music is set to receive more income this year£153 million, according to industry press reportsthan every songwriter and composer in the UK combined, including the rich ones, will receive from the streaming of their music in this country"
3269," The report, titled Economics of music streaming, was unanimously agreed, crossparty, after many months of hearings with witnesses from all parts of the music industry and after hundreds of written submissions on the subject were received"
3270," Sadly, the other big two, Warner and Universal, have not followed suit, and in the latter case, a public share offering has been issued that will result in the extraordinary £153 million payout to the companys boss, at a time when many artists have been struggling to pay their rent, as we heard in evidence"
3271," It extends the existing Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 to modernise the law for the new world of music streaming"
3272," The Committee concluded that the fix that I am proposing today was the best way to build on existing UK law to rectify the matter, but there is an issue with how much streaming services pay and with how much they are paid by record companies about 30%, after the Chancellor has his bit, of the cut from the subscription we pay and the ad revenues"
3273," The point is that labels no longer have to manufacture or distribute records, there is no longer a percentage getting broken on the way to the record shopall those costs are gone"
3274, Streaming revenue actually grew by 20% in 2020
3275," In fact, fully independent music accounts  for a very small proportion, probably 6%, of the total market, and fully independent artists who experience success are the ones making the most from streaming"
3276," As for companies, which are sometimes making 20% profit margins in the streaming era, with none of the costs associated with distribution or manufacturing, saying that they will pass any cut to that margin on to their own artists, that is surely the strongest possible argument that there is something very wrong with competition in this market"
3277, One company may control as much as 40% of the market
3278," When changes were made in 2003 to copyright in relation to film, similar points were made, but we have seen the burgeoning expansion of the British film industry since that point, and I want the same for music"
3279," Gentleman mentions Lucian Grainge; he may be aware that were an artist in Britain to produce a song and get 1 million streams, they would receive around £100, so to receive the £153 million that Lucian Grainge gets, that artist would need 1"
3280,5 million million streams
3281," While Lucian Grainge may be a great corporate man, making £3 million a week, he has never produced any music that we would ever want to listen to"
3282, It has brought in a programme called Artists Forward in which it has essentially written off unrecouped balances for artists signed before the year 2000
3283," Will he acknowledge that it is also a vital part of our tourism attraction, bringing in about £4"
3284,7 billion in tourism revenue for this country every year
3285, We are talking about £4
3286,"7 billion of spending in the UK economy, which was an increase of 6% of the prior year"
3287," I recall that in the early 2000s there were sites such as Napster, which in their very early  stages shared content that I am sure the artist did not even know was being shared"
3288," We have to get the right balance between protecting artists 100%, ensuring innovation with regard to platforms and new forms of engaging with media and music, and making sure that we remain competitive in the UK"
3289," Watford has the Colosseum, which has done recordings for films such as The Lord of the Ringsreally incredible pieces that have been heard around the world by millions, if not billions, of people"
3290, Does he agree that it is a scandal that artists are getting perhaps a quarter of what the big record labels are getting from streaming services As my hon
3291," I very much hope I will receive an invitation to hear his crossparty band, MP4"
3292, Global revenues hit £16
3293,2 billion last yearthe highest since 2002
3294," Between 2015 and 2019, revenues enjoyed by labels have grown by more than £200 million"
3295," 1 pop stars on Radio 1 or at the forefront of everyones mind when we think about rock and roll or music streaming, but there is a huge weight of people who are fansindividuals or groups who are more at the edges"
3296," It is now commonplace, but it was a brave and innovative vision and move from Daniel Ek, Spotifys founder, back in 2006"
3297," There were 100 million new music subscribers in 2020, taking the total to 467 million, whereas back in 2015 it stood at 76"
3298,8 million
3299," Each one of those subscribers is paying on average £120 a year, so we can see the growth and the enormity of streaming"
3300," A licence gives the artist 50% of the royalties for a song, whereas a sale gives them between 18% and 30%"
3301," We might have needed to provide some extra money through universal credit, and that would be right, but these  international companies should have paid their way and not asked the British taxpayer to pay those wages on their behalf"
3302, I note that in 2017 the figure was 31
3303,"92%, and I am sure my hon"
3304," Friend will be surprised to learn that it went down in 2018, 2019 and 2020, to 30"
3305,13%
3306, to 100% of the money they generate
3307," Artist remuneration has risen to 46% of overall revenue, compared with an increase in label revenues of 31%, meaning that artists are claiming a larger share of streaming revenue than they have done traditionally"
3308," Successful artists from the 1980s funded investment into new artists in the 1990s, which in turn funded investment into the young artists of the 2000s"
3309," I suggest to her that if we look at the music business around the world, 30% RD is what is happening in all markets"
3310," YouTube accounted for more than 20% of streaming consumption in the UK last year, but generated only £35 million in royalties, £20 million less than artists and labels earned from good oldfashioned vinyl records"
3311," In fact, the top 1% will get richer at everybody elses expense"
3312," Gentleman in a moment, because no doubt he will want to remind us how reasonable it is that the CEO of Universal gets £153 million a year, which is more than the entirety of sales and of streaming for all UK artists and songwriters, including people such as Ed Sheeran"
3313," To get that from streaming, as I mentioned, he would have to have 1"
3314,5 million million streams
3315," Gentleman may claim that 1 million streams is not very much, but I would very much enjoy a small fraction of that for this speech anywhere it was shown"
3316, It is a lot for a musician to break through that million mark
3317," I appreciate that, in the global marketplace, there are stars who break through into the billions, but that is not the point"
3318, The point has been made already about the hundreds of thousands of people in the industry and its importance for the export and tourism markets
3319, 1 in the charts
3320," We have set out the creative industries sector deal, the creative sector tax reliefs, the film and television production restart scheme and the culture recovery fund, and the Chancellors plan for growth sets out a major longterm commitment to the sector, which we calculate contributes approximately £116 billion to the UK economy"
3321," At the recent Budget the Government announced £42 million to support our creative industries, and we include in that the small and mediumsized enterprises at the heart of film, music and video gamesthat broader nexus of digital entrepreneurship"
3322," The BPI reported revenues from streaming growing to almost £737 million in 2020, which is a 15% increase during the pandemic, with smartphones, smart speakers and music streaming services providing unprecedented choice for consumers"
3323," That was the biggest arts funding package in our history, and the Chancellor made available £2 billion at speed, with awards to more than 800 musicbased organisations"
3324," We also put in place the £800 million reinsurance scheme and I am delighted, as I am sure all Members are, that we can get back to live music venues, and indeed to live theatre and pub theatre"
3325," Our 1709 Statute of Anne was the first copyright Act in the world, and today the UK is a world leader in copyright law and intellectual property enforcement"
3326," We are determined to tackle the problem of piracy, and not just those of us  who remember recording Top of the Pops on a cassette in the 1970s, which is a low form of thatI would not say it is harmless, but as the former Chair of the Select Committee made clear, probably all of us old enough to do so did it, and it was wrong"
3327," From the early 2000s, record companies saw a 15year period of global revenue decline"
3328," Recorded music revenues were decimated due to digital piracy, and subscription streaming services such as Spotifyothers are availableentered the market in 2008"
3329," By 2015, they had played a major part in halting that decline, as consumers began to adopt subscription services and paying for the right to listen to music"
3330," In 2015, there were on average 2"
3331,1 billion streams a month
3332," By 2020, that figure had grown to 10 billion"
3333," I am pleased that a number of singersongwriters, composers and musicians in my area have benefited from that, including MaryAnne Hatton, Oliver Seager and Jack PerryCockings, who have all received support of up to £10,000 from the fund"
3334," Decca Records contributed £10,000 to kickstart our Dame Vera Lynn memorial project and the statue dedicated to her, but it must not be the case that the record companies and those advocating a voluntary approach can just do or give what they want"
3335," Friend the Member for Watford Dean Russell regaled us with earlier, I may even have auditioned for the New Zealand version of the Spice Girls in 1998, and I was also in a queue at 3 am, in the ExCeL centre in London, to audition for The X Factor in 2010"

3337, 11 2
3338, Friend the Member for Perth and North Perthshire Pete Wishart and I are occasionally together in a musical enterprise called MP4
3339," It makes up more than 70% of UK recorded music revenues, generating hundreds of millions of pounds of new revenue for the UK music industry"
3340," The music industrys importance to the UK economy is frequently citedas the Select Committee points out, it contributes more than £5 billion in gross value addedand we are the second biggest exporter of music in the world, which does an enormous amount in terms of global Britain and the projection of our soft power"
3341, Lucian Grainge is the chief executive of Universal Music and is going to bank a huge amount of money this year because Universal Music has just conducted a very successful initial public offering and sold a 10% share
3342," Beginning in the early 2000s, there was a 15year decline in music industry revenue that was directly attributable to piracy"
3343," We have been together in so many of the various torturous debates about copyright reform, and I think we all still bear the scars of the Digital Economy Act 2017"
3344, I just hope that the record labels that have written to us so assiduously in the past few weeks sometimes remember what we did for them when the dark times started to descend on the sector and the industry in the early 2000s
3345," Gentlemans for about  20 years in MP4, the worlds only parliamentary rock band"
3346," Lots of people ask, What does this musical moonlighting mean for the future of MP4 Well, we are the only rock band in the world that can sustain political differences as well as musical differences, so I think we can maybe just put up with a bit of musical moonlighting"
3347," I was signed to two major record companies I signed to Chrysalis Records in 1987, and it was taken over by EMI in the early 1990s"
3348, We did quite well during that period we sold 1
3349,"5 million records, we had modest success in the UK with two topfive albums, and we had a couple of topfive albums in Scandinavia and Germany"
3350, We sold 1
3351," Thousands did return, but with lifechanging injuries, and over 3,500 personnel from other NATO forces were also killed"
3352," Since Ahmad Shah Durrani founded modernday Afghanistan in the 1700s, it has not been run from the centre"
3353," The objective of hunting down and destroying alQaeda after 911 was widely supported, and it triggered NATOs article 5 for the first time"

3355, It mobilised tens of thousands of holy warriors who were willing to die for their cause
3356," However, there was the colossal blanket of NATO security, and a huge development budget often described as an international aid juggernaut; US spending alone peaked in one year at $110 billion"
3357," Secondly, we denied the Taliban a seat at the table in December  2001 at the Bonn talks"
3358," Thirdly, we made no real effort to start training an Afghan indigenous security force until 2006"
3359," Negotiations began in earnest in 2018, but when a deal was finally signed in February 2020, the agreement was between the United States and the Taliban; this time, the Afghan Government were not at the table"
3360, The 1
3361,4% cut in defence spending over the next four years is deeply worrying
3362," One thing I would like to see from the inquiry is an investigation into what assessment, prior or immediately prior to the intervention in 2001, was made of the militarys capability to intervene and maintain our defences at the level required"
3363," In 2009, the NATO conference took place in Edinburgh"
3364," What I will never forget is that while they were enjoying a drop of Scotlands finest, they suddenly said to me, What on earth are you doing in Afghanistan This was in 2009, eight years after we went in"
3365," Those attacks killed 2,977 innocent civilians, including 67 British citizens, and we were right to defend our national security"
3366," We know that the Taliban are the root cause of the death and destruction that, unfortunately, has come to define Afghanistan since the 1990s, but we need to understand why they were able to defeat the Afghan army at such a shattering scale and pace"
3367, 1107
3368," Why have so many colleagues failed to get adequate responses from the Foreign Office and Home Office helplines on behalf of their constituents How many more vulnerable Afghans do the Government have on their list of people who need to be supported to leave the country Why is the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme still not open for applications Is it because the Government actually have no intention of ever opening it for applications Are they in effect pursuing an operation of tapping on the shoulder, rather than opening the scheme up for applications, because the response would be so overwhelming If so, the Minister should inform the House"
3369," Just to be clear, what I said in my remarks was that there had already been multiple inquiries into the Afghan intervention preceding 2010some by the Defence Committee"
3370," It has been handed over to the Taliban, but the spirit of what is now there in Afghanistan will be bigger than anything the Taliban can do to undo it and turn it back to what we saw in the 1990s"

3379," On 31 October, he announced the allocation of £50 million of that to fund emergency humanitarian support"

3381,"5 million people with lifesaving healthcare, food security, and shelter"

3821," How can we trust the Government and the Home Office How can we trust them with the measures proposed in clause 9 Simply put, we cannot, and I therefore commend the right hon"
3822," Member for Haltemprice and Howden Mr Davis on bringing forward amendment 12, which would remove clause 9 from the Bill"
3823," We support that new clause, which concerns the fee£1,012 for a childthat people must pay to exercise their right to be registered as a British citizen"
3824," Members across this House, I have raised many cases on behalf of constituents navigating this inefficient,  ineffective and expensive system"
3825,"Even though the Scottish National party has fundamental disagreements with most of this horrific Bill, that is not the case for part 1, where we are in agreement with much of it"
3826," Members might be interested to know that, in 2018, the Home Office made profits of £500 million by charging £500 million more than it cost to process applications"
3827," The cost to the Home Office of the registration process is about £372 a person, but to the person applying, it is a minimum of £1,100 for children and £1,200 for an adult"
3828," I would like nobody to experience it, but I would urge Conservative Members to trust me when I say that it took him years to save up the £1,200, and he could not have saved any harder"
3829, Amendment 2 in the name of the right hon
3830," We are very much opposed to clause 9, which, as we have heard, grants the Home Secretary the power to strip UK nationals of their citizenship in secret and without advance warning"
3831, Does he share my concern that 93% of those who have been arrested just for being prodemocracy are young people We have a unique obligation to protect them and provide them with safe and legal passage
3832," The key point that arises from her remarks is that the British Government have, sensibly and rightly, introduced the British National Overseas visa, which allows people in Hong Kong who registered for that scheme before the handover of Hong Kong in 1997 the right to settle in this country"
3833,"I wish to speak to new clause 8 about child citizenship fees, which I am grateful has been signed by a number of Members"
3834," If the £35 fee introduced back in 1983 had risen in line with inflation, it would be only £120 today"
3835," Instead, we charge £1,012a fee that has doubled in the past decade, and which the Government have the ability to increase at will"
3836," I hope that, when new clause 8hopefullygoes to a vote, every other Member of this House will walk through the Lobby with me and show those young people that they have every single right to be here, that we will not continue to price them out, and that they should be able to access every single right, just like myself and the Prime Minister have been able to do"
3837," Member agree that, while the amendment is welcome and it would be an improvement on the current situation, it would still mean that young people born after 1997 were relying on the BNO status of their parents, and that that would disproportionately impact poorer Hongkongers and people whose families moved after 1997"
3838," It is likely that if this Bill had been law in the early 1970s, I would have been stripped of my citizenship as a young child"
3839," Household energy bills have increased by more than £230 since last winter and are set to increase even more early next year, and we have recently seen higher tax receipts from energy bills"
3840, I therefore call on Members from across the House to support new clause 2
3841, Member for Crawley Henry Smith in proposing new clause 2
3842," I wish to put on record the Oppositions support for the new clause, which seeks to rectify the longstanding injustice in British nationality law that affects a relatively small number of peopleChagossian people, descendants of the Chagos islanders, who were forcibly removed from the British Indian Ocean Territory in the 1960s"
3843, Members on both sides of the House will support new clause 2
3844, I will focus my comments on part 1
3845," Clause 9 provides the Government with dangerous and unprecedented powers to deprive UK nationals of citizenship, without warning"
3846," Through clause 9, the Government seek to amend the longstanding position under the British Nationality Act 1981 that an individual must be notified if they are to be deprived of their nationality"
3847,"I am a cosignatory to new clause 4, and I congratulate the hon"
3848,I rise to speak to amendment 12 to clause 9
3849," The UK was a very different country in the 1970s, when racism and farright marches were common and Idi Amin had just thrown the Asians out of Uganda"
3850," Clause 9 alters the requirement for the Home Secretary to serve notice on a person in cases where this would be impracticable, such as if they are in hiding or in the middle of a warzone"
3851, I will speak against new clause 12 and in favour of clause 9
3852,"The Government very much recognise the challenge that people are facing, which is why we have introduced a range of interventions, including the warm home discount; the household support fund, giving £500 million to local authorities to distribute; changes to the taper rate; and an increase in the national living wage"
3853, Households in the lowest income decile receive on average more than £4 in public spending for every £1 that they pay in tax
3854, Crimes linked to drugs in Scotland cost £750 million a year to investigate and prosecute
3855, I would add that the recent Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland reports in August showed that the deficit last year for the Scottish budget was £36
3856,3 billion
3857,The uplift in universal credit was always intended to be temporaryit was to help claimants through the economic shock and financial disruption of the pandemicand we now have the kickstart programme and a multibillionpound plan for jobs
3858," I understand it is difficult to break a manifesto promise, and the Prime Minister was clear that he was doing that in raising national insurance, but he also had a manifesto promise to address social care, which, since Tony Blair said he would address it in 1997, has not been done"
3859," Data from Public Health England estimates that two doses of a covid19 vaccine offers protection of around 96% against hospitalisation and that our jabs have prevented over 100,000 deaths, over 143,000 hospitalisations and around 24 million infections"
3860, Some 88% of people have had one jab and more than 80% of people aged 16 and over have now had the protection of both doses
3861," The strength of support was over £14 billion during the covid crisis, and the furlough support helped 900,000 jobs in Scotland at the height of the pandemic, which is nearly a third of the Scottish workforce"
3862, The top 20% of households by income will pay 40 times what the poorest 20% pay; the top 40% will pay half of the entire levy
3863," In 2018, the current shadow Minister for Social Care, the hon"
3864,"Over the summer, new data published by the SNP Scottish Government showed the Union dividend to be worth £2,210 a person in Scotland"
3865, Citizens Advice Scotland says that more than half those people are worried about being able to buy food
3866," The Joseph Rowntree Foundation says that about 150,000 working families on low incomes in Scotland will pay an average of £100 extra in tax while losing £1,000"
3867," What advice does the Secretary of State give those families on low incomes on where they should cut £1,100 from their family budgets"
3868, The proportion of schools rated as good or outstanding by Ofsted has risen from 68% in 2010 to 86% in 2020
3869," Between 2011 and 2019, the attainment gap between disadvantaged children and their wealthier peers narrowed by 13% at age 11 and 9% at age 16"
3870," In 2019, 82% of year 1 pupils met the expected standard for reading, compared with just 58% when the lighttouch phonics check was introduced"
3871, Over half of children are now educated in academies and 42% of schools are now academies
3872," Some 84% of academies are part of multiacademy trusts, or MATs, and as of August last year, there were 1,180 MATs, covering 7,680 academies between them"
3873," Of those, 70% oversee six schools or fewer, and 38% run two or three schools"
3874," Over the years, various scandals have appeared in the papers, such as trusts paying for the lease of a new Jaguar for their chief executive, trusts paying thousands for firstclass travel and highclass hotel rooms, and even trusts paying for transatlantic flights"
3875," We regularly hear of trusts chief executives getting huge salaries of £100,000 or £200,000and, in some cases, close to half a million pounds"
3876," Having previously been placed in special measures, Whitfield Valley Primary Academy in Fegg Hayes in my StokeonTrent North, Kidsgrove and Talke constituency is now rated good by Ofsted, and with outstanding leadership, since becoming part of the Inspirational Learning Academies Trust in 2015"
3877," I thank the previous Education Committee, which in a 2017 report found that there was a gap in assessing the performance of MATs not fulfilled by either Ofsted or regional school commissioners"
3878," In 2018, Ofsted trialled a new approach to inspecting academies that involved a number of inspections of individual academies from a MAT taking place over a period of up to two terms"
3879," In 2015, we saw the scrapping of plans for a carbon capture and underground storage plant in Peterhead, so I am simply seeking reassurance from the Secretary of State that the Acorn project will be one of two clusters to receive backing from his Government next month"
3880," We want Acorn to be one of the tier 1 projects, and we are pressing for that"
3881,"On Cambo, all our North sea oil licences are factored into the 2050 net zero plan"
3882," Last week, I had, as others have, constituents contact me on behalf of people who they served with in Afghanistan"
3883," There is hardly any time in this debate, and the votes will come no later than 9"
3884," It is intended to strengthen the security and resilience of all our public telecoms networks, be they fixed line or mobile2G, 3G, 4G, 5G and beyond"
3885," We have been insistent on this position, and that is why I ask that this House disagrees with Lords amendment 4"
3886," As I have set out, however, it would be inappropriate to agree to Lords amendments 4 and 5"
3887," I commend Lords amendments 1, 2 and 3 to the House and ask that the House disagrees with Lords amendments 4 and 5"
3888," Friend also agree that this did not come as a great shock to the Government It was all laid out in the 2013 Intelligence and Security Committee report on critical national infrastructure, but nothing has been done since then"
3889, We agreed that the entirety of Lords amendments 1 to 3 was broadly beneficial
3890, We looked at Lords amendment 5 and we understood the temptation to flag up the importance of the Five Eyes relationship
3891, That leaves us with Lords amendment 4
3892," Therefore, like the Chairman of our parallel Committee, I will not be voting against Lords amendment 4 tonight"
3893," That is what the Government promised in 2013 when the legislation was originally put through, for our Committees powers, and it is a promise that we expect them to keep"
3894, Lords amendment 4 on the diversification strategy is vital
3895," When people try to give the impression that the issue of telecoms security suddenly hit us like a bolt out of the blue because of Huawei, I suggest that they read the 2013 ISC report on critical national infrastructure"
3896," It is now in the hands of the Prime Minister to ensure that the memorandum of understanding is amended and is, as the Chair of the ISC said, in line with the Justice and Security Act 2013, which envisaged that we would have oversight if security went into other areas"
3897," With regard to Lords amendment 5 on Five Eyes review, we believe that the intelligence community will naturally  consider the views of Five Eyes partners as part of its reporting, so the new clause, although worthy, is not really necessary"
3898," In December, David Fuller was charged with the murder of two young women, Wendy Knell and Caroline Pierce, in the Tunbridge Wells area of Kent in 1987"
3899," However, Lords amendment 4 on network diversification is very strong, and I am minded not to support the Government on it tonight"
3900, Two consequential amendments to Lords amendment 1 set out the conditions for the 40day scrutiny period and ensure that that time cannot be disrupted by recess or Prorogation so that this House and the other place have sufficient time to scrutinise the code
3901," In 2010 the Tories inherited a secure, competitive and worldleading network"
3902," However, I will take the opportunity to set out the SNPs views on Lords amendments 4 and 5 and, importantly, briefly to reflect on why we are in the situation that we are in"
3903," Actually, that kind of ties in to Lords amendment 5 it is because of the mess that the Government have created in relation to Huawei"
3904," I respectfully suggest that, in relation to Lords amendment 5, it is almost akin to the fact that they have learned nothing"
3905," That, from my perspective, simply does not cut it, especially, as we have heard, when some £2 billion has already been wasted on this debacle, notwithstanding the economic impact of being so many years behind in the rollout of 5G itself"
3906," That, in many senses, covers Lords amendment 5"
3907," If I got the scope of it correctly, she was saying that Lords amendment 4 is far too narrow and would make the Governments life too difficult"
3908, Any guidance issued must be consistent with the duty in paragraph 17 of schedule 1 for the Secretary of State to have regard to the need to protect the independence of the OEP
3909," The decisions of organisations such as the Centre for  Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, which employs hundreds of worldleading marine scientists, will be based on deep expertise and often highly technical scientific data"
3910," Enforcement was a key part of the Dukes amendment and our version goes further, because it will dock in with the existing enforcement regime in the Water Industry Act 1991"
3911," Ofwat can issue enforcement notices that can direct specific actions or fine companies up to 10% of their annual turnover, running to millions of pounds"
3912," It estimated that the complete elimination of sewage discharges through storm overflows in England, which many are calling for more broadly, is likely to cost between approximately £350 billion and £600 billion"
3913," That could mean up to £1,000 on bills every year"
3914," I thank the Minister and the Secretary of State for their time speaking to the Opposition about the issue, and I am grateful for the Ministers words today putting our concerns on record, but I have to say that publishing an amendment at 5 pm last Friday did not really build trust, either among Members on both sides of the House who wanted to see the detail or among the stakeholders who were looking forward to scrutinising carefully what the Minister had to say"
3915," It is not sufficient to say, To deal with this properly will cost £600 billion, but to deal with tinkering around the edges will cost hardly anything on the side, and pretend that those are fair options to choose between"
3916," Although we have our own problems with outdated Victorian sewer systems struggling to cope with the once in a hundred years events that now seem to be occurring every two to three years, the fact remains that any profits made by Scottish Water are invested in the services and infrastructure of Scotlands waterways rather than the pockets of shareholders, and that Scottish Water does not carry the stratospheric levels of debt carried by English water companiesand that is the way the people of Scotland like it too"
3917,2 miles along it
3918," Yet again, the Minister quotes the £600 billion cost that she says dealing with the problem will cause, but the water companies say the cost is in the region of £13 billion to £20 billion using concrete storage tanks, or £20 billion to £30 billion more if they are accompanied by natural drainage schemes that bring wider community benefits"
3919, That compares with the £1
3920,2 billion already being spent by industry on overflows between 2020 and 2025
3921," Currently, a water company dumps 40% of all the phosphates in Windermere"
3922," If that goes down to 39%, there is no measure to say whether that is okay, so I assume the water companies will think that it is okay"
3923,We have been two and a quarter years bringing this enormous Bill through Parliament
3924,"I beg to move, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 4"
3925," Lords amendments 1 to 3 were tabled by my colleague in the other place, Lord Parkinson"
3926, Lords amendment 4 relates to reporting on supply chain diversification and Lords amendment 5 relates to reviewing actions taken by Five Eyes nations regarding highrisk vendors
3927, I will speak first to Lords amendments 1 to 3
3928," We carefully considered the Committees recommendation over the summer, and tabled amendments 1 to 3 in the other place to accept them"
3929, 1056
3930," Gentleman and the House that we only have two suppliers for 5G now, but the technology is evolving and there are new technologies for the next generation of networks6G"
3931,"I rise to speak in favour of Lords amendment 5, which was tabled by Lord Alton and Lord Blencathra"
3932, I believe that Lords amendment 5 would further strengthen our ties with those great allies and ensure that we look to the future of the security and resilience of our telecommunications network
3933," I hope that this House will approve amendment 5, as it will send a clear message that technology companies that work against our national interest will not be allowed to operate in the United Kingdom"
3934, Friend the Minister about Lords amendment 4
3935," Lords amendment 4 does have merits, because it recognises that there is a real problem about diversification"
3936,"I rise to speak in favour of Lords amendment 5, which was championed in the other place by my Friend, Lord Alton and which focuses on the Five Eyes partnership"
3937," I also urge the Minister, if she has the time, to read the Uyghur forced labour in Xinjiang and UK value chains report, and in particular to focus on article 7 of Chinas national intelligence law, which states that any company that is registered in China has to provide data to the Chinese Communist party on demand, and also to deny to any other state that it is doing so"
3938," We are investing to ensure that we level up in Northern Ireland, with £60 million this year from the levellingup fund, the community renewal fund and the community ownership fund, as well as £400 million from the new deal for Northern Ireland and more than £600 million in city and growth deal investment to drive growth"
3939, The best estimates are that hundreds of suicides every year are of people living with a terminal illness
3940," Friend mentioned, assisted dying has been legal for a quarter of a century, and the eligibility criteria and processes remain essentially the same as the day they were introduced"
3941," Two weeks ago, the States Assembly of Jersey voted by a large margin of 36 votes to 10 in support of a proposition on assisted dying, with draft legislation to be introduced by 2023"
3942," A widely signed petition led to the establishment of a citizens jury of islanders, which found that more than 75% of participants wanted to legalise assisted dying"
3943," Dignity means different things to different people, but as the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman pointed out in a 2014 report, there are some key actions to ensure that people have dignity at the end of life They include allowing patient choice through appropriate care planning and promoting good and timely communication, with patients and their families and between the people and organisations supporting them"
3944," We are boosting local economies through city and growth deals and providing, along with the Northern Ireland Executive, a UK contribution of more than £730 million to the Peace Plus programme to contribute to a more prosperous and stable Northern Ireland"
3945," I recognise the extraordinary pain and distress of those individuals and their families, but is he aware that in Oregonthe legislation being proposed in the other place is based on the law thereover half the people who apply for assisted death do so not because of terrible pain and suffering, but because they do not want to be a burden on their family That is the consideration that motivates them"
3946," The Prime Minister announced the towns fund; the Chancellor set out a landmark £4 billion levellingup fund for investment in the infrastructure of everyday life; there is the UK shared prosperity fund, to support communities after Brexit; and now we have a Department focused on delivering our levellingup mission, so that every community across the country can benefit from the policies of this Government"
3947," Recent polling from Survation found that two thirds of residents in leftbehind neighbourhoods felt that their neighbourhood was missing out on community facilities; over half said that their area had fewer resources, such as parks, leisure and sports facilities, and places to meet"
3948," As importantly, almost 60% of residents said that they wanted more of a say in how future funding in their area was spent"
3949," As we heard in the Chamber on Monday, the expanded dormant assets scheme provides almost £900 million, which could initially be used for this fund, so there would be no drain on the public purse"
3950,This week thousands of my Hindu constituents and millions worldwide start the celebrations of the birth centenary of His Holiness Mahant Swami Maharaj
3951, He was of course the inspiration behind the worldrenowned Neasden temple and hundreds of other temples
3952, I think it is still shameful that only 7% of the population benefit from integrated education
3953," However, if his proposals are to secure any traction, they will have to be compliant with article 2, and we will have to see a fully fleshed out plan for truth and reconciliation"
3954," We are determined to deliver on that, and we are determined to ensure that what we deliver is article 2 compliant"
3955," Rather than delayingthe Secretary of State did promise it in the autumn and he did promise it before Christmas, and it has not emergedcan he give a clear assurance, on behalf of the victims, that he has gone back to the drawing board and will only return with proposals once victims are front and centre and in the driving seat That is what they deserve, and that is what Governments should deliver for them"
3956,"Amendments made 64, page 59, line 1, leave out subsection 2"
3957," I must be clear if HS2 ever gets as far north as us in Lancashire and Cumbria, which seems like something of a long shot, we cannot have trains not stopping in Lancaster"
3958," We have had £100 million for a plan, but so far, there is no indication that the line will materialise"
3959," 1 question that I am asked as a local MPwhere is our railway in Fleetwood The track bed is there, but there are no trains running up and down it"
3960,"Much to the Prime Ministers presumed disappointment, his proposed bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland has been rejected as impossible to justify by his own advisers, as it would cost £300 billion, 22 times more than the Prime Ministers estimates"
3961, Member for giving me notice of the point of order on behalf of her constituents
3962,"That the draft Solvency 2 Group Supervision Amendment Regulations 2021, which were laid before this House on 15 November, be approved"
3963," This petition complements that to Warwick District Council which has 1,050 signatures demanding that it establishes a citizens assembly to examine governance options before holding a referendum"

5852," We could spend all our time referring to what we said 10 years ago, and how the Health and Social Care Act 2012 has proved to be the disaster that we said it would be, but we will spare the Government the We told you so lectures, because even those on the Government Benches are now aware that the 2012 Act has been among the worst policy mistakes in the history of the NHS"

5876, He can say that with some force because of the more than £5 billion extra being put forward by the Government to fund social care in a sustainable way for the future
5877, We now have more than 5
5878,7 million people on NHS waiting lists
5879," After the Government won the 2010 election, around 500,000 to 750,000 people were on NHS waiting lists, and the number rose every year before the pandemic, so the waiting lists are the longterm effect of the Conservative policies of underfunding and privatisation"
5880," Among people younger than 65, the covid19 mortality rate was almost four times higher for the 10% living in the mostdeprived areas than for those living in the leastdeprived areas"
5881,"I caught your eye half a minute ago, Madam Deputy Speaker, and you indicated to me with that look that I was next"
5882," Over the next few years, we need to recruit 9,000 more mental health nurses to   look after our constituents and more than 800 new psychiatrists, and we need to give all organisations charged with delivering healthcare that nudge, that push, that call to arms that they need to make these important things happen"
5883, The billions squandered on test and trace should serve as a warning of what the Government could do to the whole of our NHS
5884, Such tendering to the private sector was made a requirement under section 75 of the coalition Governments Health and Social Care Act 2012
5885," I will be voting against the whole Bill, but if the Government refuse to accept amendment 9 to make the NHS the default provider, that shows what the Government of the party that objected to the foundation of the NHS in the first place are really up to, despite all the warm words"
5886," NHS England research indicates that the outcomes for most major conditions are significantly better than they were 10 years ago, and the NHS is seeing more patients and delivering more tests, treatments and operations than at any time in its 73year historymillions more than 10 years ago when the Conservatives returned to power"

6466," I also support new clauses 7 and 2, which seek to beef up enforcement"
6467,8 fulltime equivalent staff
6468," It is welcome that the Government have increased the penalties, but I still fear that we are talking about people for whom billions of pounds are the standard currency that they are dealing with"
6469," For minor errors such as submitting a late return, there is usually a fixed penalty of a few hundred pounds, but if a tax return is intentionally wrong, or there has been a lack of reasonable care, HMRC levies penalties as a percentage of the tax dueup to 30% for carelessness and up to 70% for deliberate inaccuracy"
6470," Two years ago, the anticorruption campaign group Global Witness looked at this and found that 4,000 of the people registered as a person of significant control were under the age of two, while one had not even been born yet"
6471," At the opposite end of the spectrum, its researchers found that five individuals each controlled more than 6,000 companies"
6472, There are more than 4 million companies registered at Companies House
6473," According to The New York Post, the former owner of Chelsea football club transferred £92 million of New York City property to his exwife, Dasha Zhukova, just before the 2018 round of sanctions was announced"
6474," Maiyas real estate empire covers more than £50 millionworth of property in Moscow alone and includes at least three companies, including Katina, which owns prime oceanfront real estate in Croatia"
6475,"I rise to speak specifically to new clause 2, on the funding of enforcement agencies, but I wish to say a couple of things about the amendments in general"
6476, I am glad he is going to talk to us about amendment 3
6477," Fraud is now the most common crime committed in the UK, with more than 5 million offences, but hardly any are prosecuted"
6478,"7% in 201617 to 67% in 202021, so we are pursuing fewer criminals and we are being less successful in getting convictions"
6479," Just to be absolutely clear, that is equivalent to 0"
6480,"042% of GDP, and that is a generous estimate that I have put together"
6481," Even though the most recent estimate that I have seen of the cost of economic crime is around £290 billion, which is well over 10% of GDP, the National Crime Agency has suffered a 4"
6482,2% cut in its core budget over the past five years
6483," In contrast, I met a group of antifinancial crime executives working for the banks and they told me that the regulated financial services sector spendshold your breath£49"
6484,5 billion every year on financial crime compliance
6485, Our £852 million is just too small in comparison
6486,It always seems to me absurd that it costs £12 to establish a new company in Companies House
6487," Obviously we want to make it easy for new businesses to enter the market, but £12 is absurd"
6488," We know that that gets exploited in relation to shell companies, but does it also facilitate economic crime If we quadrupled that figure to £50, it would still not be a fortune, but we would then have a massive investment that we could put into our enforcement agencies without raising any further money through taxation"
6489," The British bank was fined £842 million in America, but only £102 million here by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK"
6490," Between 2016 and 2021, the law enforcement bodies brought £3"
6491,9 billion back into the UK coffers
6492," If that money had been reinvested, which is one of the ideas for funding the enforcement agencies, it could have brought an extra three quarters of a billion pounds to be spent on enforcement by all those agencies"
6493, Our amendments 18 to 23 would lower the threshold for beneficial ownership from 25% to 10%
6494, New clauses 2 and 9 deal with that
6495," There are nowhere near enough resources applied to economic crime it represents 40% of all crime, but 1% of the resources"
6496," For example, last year I think the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, one of the bodies charged with enforcement, sanctioned two individuals or companies with collective fines of £85,000"
6497," In the US, a similar body levied 87 fines totalling £1"
6498,"5 billion, because it is properly resourced"
6499," Some 43% of all financial crimes are identified through whistleblowers, yet it is something we do not talk about"
6500," Airbus paid $3 billion in fines internationally and £900 million to the UK Treasury, and all that money came as a result of a disclosure from whistleblowers"
6501," So if you are thinking of blowing the whistle, will you do it My constituent, Ian Foxley, who was involved in the GPT Special Projects case that resulted in £28 million of financial sanctions at Southwark court last year, has been 11 years without a single penny"
6502," That man was earning £200,000 a year"
6503," The ASA issues enforcement notices to online retailers where parcel surcharging practices are raised, and it has achieved a compliance rate of over 95%"
6504," Friend the Member for Moray described one of the 5%, where, because of the way it was phrased, the ASA let them get away with it"
6505, May I ask him specifically for an update on the £900 million that I have requested for South Yorkshire to match the shared prosperity fund commitments that the Government have rightly made to Cornwall
6506,I am delighted that the UK Government have recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Wrexham and Denbighshire councils in order to allow the first phase of the £13
6507,3 million levellingup projects in Clwyd South to progress
6508,1 The Secretary of State may by notice publish the name of a person being considered as a subject for sanctions
6509,"Amendments made 50, page 16, line 11, leave out £500 and onetenth and insert £2,500 and one half"
6510,"I rise to speak in support of new clauses 7 and 8, but I want to start by expressing my solidarity with the people of Ukraine, who face unimaginable heartbreak and horror, and particularly to black residents who have been subject to unacceptable levels of racism and brutality"
6511," Since as early as 2016, the Government have been making empty promises for tighter regulations to prevent these illicit activities, but since then, £1"
6512,5 billionworth of property here has been bought by Russian oligarchs accused of corruption with links to the Kremlin
6513, Given the almost £2 million received in Russialinked donations by the Tory party since the current Prime Minister entered No
6514,"I rise to speak to the amendments in my name new clause 5 and, in particular, amendment 4, which is supported by the crossparty group that has been trying to get our ducks in a row"
6515, I heard what the Minister said about Economic Crime Bill 2
6516," It sounds like the promise of the good sequel after the filmit is coming and it will be even bigger and better, with bigger stars than the first onebut we all know how sometimes part 2 can be a flop"
6517, I sincerely hope that part 2 will come sooner
6518, I wonder whether we might want to try to do that with part 2 and part 3 and get the sequels out as quickly as possible because each one will be pretty meaty and need time
6519, I hope that Economic Crime Bill 2 will have all the necessary powers to clamp down on that activity
6520, Many of them own companies that potentially employ thousands of people in this country
6521," We have all seen the reckless assault on nuclear facilities and the apparent use of cluster bombs and indiscriminate weaponry in civilian areas, but we have also all seen the incredible bravery and patriotism of the Ukrainian people, with hundreds of thousands of volunteers from all walks of life picking up arms and fighting and dying for their country"
6522," I understand why getting directly involved in this conflict could lead to much wider suffering and conflict, but because we are letting others fight and die on our behalf, it is incumbent on us to do everything else we possibly can to help them"
6523," It was the Labour party that introduced the tier 1 visa, which seems to have been one of the ways in which this country has been exploited"
6524,  Representatives of Americas justice system suggest that billions of poundsworth of properties are hidden in New York limited liability companies
6525," Whether it was behind closed doors, or in plain sight when they proceeded with the plans for Nord Stream 2, we know that ultimately that money and those projects date back to a corrupt, criminal regime that stole its funding from the Russian people"
6526, It is very important that this is included in part 2 of the Bill
6527,1 Section 11 of the 2018 Act designation of a person by name under a designation power is amended in accordance with subsections 2 to 6
6528,1 Section 12 of the 2018 Act designation by persons by description under a designation power is amended in accordance with subsections 2 to 9
6529, It is substantially the same as NC40 but refers in subsection 2 to Part 3 of the Sanctions and AntiMoney Laundering Act 2018 as well as to Part 1
6530, This new clause would therefore allow an appropriate Minister to make consequential amendments to Parts 1 and 3 of the 2018 Act and regulations made under Part 1 of that Act; and amendments to Parts 1 and 3 would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure whereas in NC40 only amendments to Part 1 would be subject to that procedure and amendments to Part 3 would be subject to negative resolution
6531," What we should be looking for is provisions that match the rights acquired under article 1 of the first protocolnamely, rights to propertyand clearly, there need to be qualifications on that in circumstances such as these"
6532, Members new clauses 2 and 3
6533," New clause 2 would bring long overdue scrutiny of that significant weakness, and renewed support for our enforcement agencies"
6534," That is why we will also be supporting new clause 3, as well as amendment 41, tabled by my SNP colleagues, in order to curb the ability of shell companies and other indirect ownership instruments, as well as their paid  London enablers, to obfuscate ownership structures for their clients"
6535," Those measures, along with new clauses 4 and 9, will tighten the massive loophole that prevents us from having a properly resourced, properly empowered and properly directed Companies House"
6536, The Government are doing something in this Bill to try to improve the equality of arms between Government lawyers and the multimillionpoundsayear lawyers on the other side
6537," If nominees are directed by someone elsesay, the beneficial ownerthe person doing the directing is caught by condition 4 in paragraph 6 of schedule 2 and is therefore a registerable beneficial owner"
6538," However, in my article in The Northern Scot this week explaining to my constituents that I was having this Adjournment debate, I said that hopefully we would get to it quicker than last Mondays, which started at 1"
6539, Amendment 4 is very simpleit would delete this now
6540," We would have pressed new clause 4 to a vote, had it not been so similar in intention to the official Oppositions new clause 7"
6541," The Hyde Group recently billed tenants £9,000 a year for waking watch, although, thankfully, it rescinded it"
6542," Leaseholders from the Renaissance buildings may be liable for £500,000 of costs relating to external wall investigations and the building safety fund application"
6543, Multimillionpound car collections will be loaded into jets; anchors will be weighed on superyachts; priceless artworks will be squirrelled awayall to wend their way back to Russia or some other safe haven for these people
6544," Similarly, we are committed to consulting Northern Ireland Ministers on regulations made under the similar mechanism for Northern Ireland in clause 324, 5 and 6"
6545, The levels were £2 million and £10 million
6546," If someone had £10 million, they could get their permanent right to remain in the UK fasttracked, and they could end up with UK citizenship"
6547," I refer to amendment 41, new clauses 4 and 21 to 23, and amendments 18 to 23  and 40"
6548,"The Governments rough sleeping snapshot recorded 2,440 people sleeping rough throughout the whole UK in the autumn"
6549,We have committed more than £800 million to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping in this year alone
6550," That includes the investment of £202 million through the rough sleeping initiative fund, which provides 14,500 bed spaces and approximately 2,700 staff throughout the country"
6551," We are also helping people to find longerterm accommodation, including through the £433 million rough sleeping accommodation programme, which we expect to provide 6,000 new homes before the end of this Parliament"
6552," Given that the new build premium is continuing to rise, and given that UK house price index data suggest that average house prices in England have increased by 18% since the scheme was first consulted on, can the Minister tell us in how many local authority areas the discount on those homes has not already been entirely eroded"
6553," We already have the First Homes scheme, which provides a 30% discount for local people, for whom those homes remain in perpetuity"
6554," Homes Englands early delivery programme will provide a further 1,500 homes, but of course we will monitor these developments and do everything we can to help people get on to the property ladder"
6555," The affordable homes programme that the Government have announced, with £11"
6556,"5 billionworth of investment, will help to secure that, so that we can try to deliver the 180,000 homes that that is expected to deliver"
6557," May I clarify it The Minister agreed to look at our amendment 3, which addresses the question of whether this is an entity or an individual, and whether, if it is an entity, that entity can put forward a company provider and thus hide the identity of the owner of the property"
6558," The SNPs new clause 4 would make Companies House an antimoney laundering supervisor, as it is strange that Companies House is not"
6559," Of the thousands of Scottish limited partnerships that have registered no person of significant control, there has now been a single fine of £210"
6560, We know they have been used  to launder millions of pounds in dirty money created by illicit business activities
6561,3 million in donations not to the Putin cronies who gave it to them but to those who have been harmed by Putin and his regime
6562," In the legislation, schedule 3 paragraph 6 requires the Land Registry to do that, and it can prohibit or restrict a transfer or a sale"
6563," To put that into context, the same report says that 87% of adults in the United Kingdom buy online"
6564, That figure rose as high as 95% during the pandemic
6565," That means that a big number of shoppers95% of 440,000 peopleare being punished not for what they want to buy, but because of where they want to buy from"
6566," The Scottish Parliament Information Centres report says that the additional cost of delivery charges in commonly affected areas, compared with the rest of Scotland, is £45 million"
6567," That is £45 million that someone has to pay because they live in Moray, Inverness or one of many areas north of Perthnot the cost of the products, but the cost to deliver them"
6568," A Findhorn resident tried to order a battery for a strimmer and was told it would be £30 to deliver to the IV36 postcode, which was almost more than the cost of the battery itself"
6569," Another constituent in Dyke was quoted £15 to order a tap for his motor home, even though free UK delivery was advertised"
6570, A constituent from Forres ordered goods worth £89 and the company was offering free delivery on orders over £40
6571, She put in her IV36 postcode and the delivery charge rose to £117
6572," So from free delivery for purchases of over £40, for her purchase of £89 it then became £117"
6573, Normal delivery was going to be £9
6574,"95, but they entered their IV36 postcode and an additional £40 was added, taking the total delivery cost to £50"
6575," Another constituent put in an order for some garden equipment and although free UK mainland delivery was advertised, they were asked to pay a surcharge of £24 for Scottish highlands"
6576," Finally, a product was ordered by one of my constituents in Elgin and they were told that the delivery charge was going to be £149"
6577, So by travelling 10 miles within Moray one can go from a charge of almost £150 for delivery to having no charge at all
6578," Another constituent in Elgin bought a bed for £435 and the order went through and was completed, but several days later she was contacted to say, Actually, we have looked at your address and there is going to be a £70 surcharge for delivery"
6579," They believed that they were going to pay a certain amount, only then to get a phone call or an email to say, Actually, weve found out where you live, we think it is too far away and we are going to put on another £70"
6580," The cost of the gardening tool was £40, but she was going to be charged £2,000 for delivery"
6581," The delivery charge for a £40 product came in at £2,001,997"
6582,Scotland was promised £1
6583,"5 billion a year when the UK left the European Union, as part of a socalled Brexit bonanza"
6584," In reality, only £172 million has been announced so far"
6585," Can the Secretary of State explain why Scotland is being shortchanged by 89%, and will he tell us when that shortfall will be addressed"
6586, The UK has committed £220 million of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and the region
6587," According to Castellan AI, the total number of sanctions placed on Russia since 2014 by country is as follows the US, 1,200; Canada, 900; Switzerland, 800; the EU, 766; and the UK, just 271"
6588," If we look at the total financial impactthe aim here is to debilitate the Russian economywe can see that the sanctions we have put on banks, defence, aviation and oligarchs add up to £364 billion"
6589," In the US, they add up to £340 billion, and in the EU, they add up to £124 billion"
6590,"The Foreign Secretary knows that a vital way to help Ukraine is to prevent those who have stolen money from the Russian people from hiding it in our capital city, but after years of austerity, our hollowedout enforcement agencies simply do not have the resources to go toe to toe with billionaire oligarchs"
6591," In 2020, the debt stood at $94 billion"
6592," We are the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian aid to Ukraine, including with our largest ever UK Aid Match contribution to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal, which has now raised more than £100 million"
6593," We are donating £220 million of humanitarian aid, which is the leading figure in the world"

6598,"On International Womens Day, Europe is leading and united in welcoming more than 2 million refugees, almost all of whom are women and children, fleeing the bloody and murderous war by Putin against Ukraine and its citizens"
6599," Lady agree that one way we can help Crimea and the whole of Ukraine is to ensure that people in Russia and Russiancontrolled territories know the truth of the murderous barbarity being done in their name Will she be encouragedI am sure she isby the fact that, in the past week, visits to the BBCs Russian language website have trebled However, that is only 10 million people, and there are 150 million people in Russia"
6600," The UK has targeted £364 billionworth of assets, whereas the US has targeted £340 billion and the EU has targeted £124 billion"
6601," We have targeted and sanctioned £364 billionworth of assets, whereas the EU has targeted £124 billion"
6602, That saved thousands of lives and helped to document the atrocities
6603," The world of royal charters and the Privy Council approvals process may feel a million miles away from the new institute of technology agenda, but when I explain the reason for this proposal, then all should, and I hope will, become very clear"
6604," IOTs are a new type of provider designed specifically to deliver the technical STEMscience, technology, engineering and mathsskills, mainly at levels 4 and 5, that employers and our economy need"
6605, It received capital funding of over £17 million and launched last year with a range of new courses based on both campuses in Swindon
6606," These are backed by an additional £120 million of capital grant funding, bringing the total to be invested in IOTs to  £290 million"
6607," Learners and employers alike need to see IOTs as the goto provider of levels 4 and 5 technical STEM provision, benefiting not just themselves but the economy as a whole"
6608," On top of this, thousands more adults will be able to access free and flexible training, and get the skills needed in sectors that are booming, such as green technologies, digital and construction"
6609," As I said at the beginning of my speech, what seems like a dry procedure is in fact the opening of a door to new opportunities and an effective means of ensuring that skills qualifications, which are a vital way of increasing productivity, get the recognition they clearly deserve and that IOTs, which offer lifechanging opportunities to thousands of people, will be a permanent part of our educational landscape"
6610," Before we start todays business, I want to inform the House that I have received a request from President Zelensky of Ukraine to address Members of this House at 5 oclock today"
6611, Todays business will therefore be interrupted at 4
6612,45 pm to enable Members to be in their places by 5 oclock
6613,"Will the Foreign Secretary speak to her colleague, the Home Secretary, about the cruel and chaotic way in which desperate Ukrainian refugees are being treated by the Home Office It cannot be right that there is no visa application centre in Calais, with Ukrainian refugees who have travelled thousands of miles to Calais being redirected either to Paris or to Brussels"
6614," Yesterdays Bill removes all of that, which means that by 15 March we will be able to sanction hundreds of individuals"
6615,"Today, on International Womens Day, we see all the women trying to escape with their families, their children and their mothers and fathers to reach places such as Poland, which has offered refuge to some 1 million refugees, and Ireland, which has taken several hundred thousand"
6616," Lady to the fact that we are the largest donor of humanitarian aid, with £220 million"

6623,I want to start the windups at 6
6624,"5 billion investment in defence spending, with more scope for hightech research and development, but the Governments plan only papers over the cracks in the MODs budget"
6625," There is also no plan to deal with massive MOD waste, despite at least £13 billion of taxpayers money being wasted through MOD mismanagement or misjudgment since 2010, with £4 billion wasted in the past couple of years alone while the present Defence Secretary has been in post"
6626," Restoring the Challenger fleet to full strength would cost an estimated £430 million, equivalent to the money wasted by the MOD"
6627," Creative accounting with rosetinted projections, which plan for undetermined savings to accrue to the MODs balance sheet at some unspecified point in the future, is the culture that manifests claims that we will see the plan come in £4"
6628,"3 billion under budgetno detail, no plan"
6629,2 billion of extra spending that the MOD has not included
6630, The MODs own Cost Assurance and Analysis Service produced an independent assessment of the cost of projects making up 58% of the plans costs this year and concluded that they are likely to cost £7
6631,6 billion more than projected
6632,6 billion
6633, The Departments financial plans once again assume further unspecified workforce cuts of £2
6634,"5 billion by 2030, but it has not yet announced how it intends to achieve that, and that almost certainly does not take into account inflationary pressures on either pay or costs of remaining staff"
6635," Of the armed forces members inhabiting single accommodation blocks, just under half are satisfied with their accommodation and 36% live in poorergrade accommodation"
6636, This Government provided defence with a fouryear settlement and a £24 billion increase in the defence budget
6637," That money, which takes the annual defence budget to more than £47 billion for 202223 and our equipment plan to more than £238 billion over 10 years, enables us to modernise and improve the defence enterprise"
6638, That will be underpinned by the doubling of investment in the shipbuilding sector over the life of this Parliament to more than £1
6639,7 billion  a year
6640," Friend the Member for Henley John Howell, we are continuing to invest in the RAF and particularly in cuttingedge capabilities such as the European common radar system mark 2, which is a fantastic radar system, to meet the operational threats of the future"
6641, We are also investing more than £2 billion over the next four years in the sixth generation future combat air system
6642, There will be 50 new Apache attack helicopters on top of the investment of more than £3 billion over the next decade in the accelerated  procurement of Boxer to help to modernise our fleet and ensure that our Army is better integrated with its NATO allies
6643, We are spending an additional £1
6644,4 billion over the next decade on space
6645,6 billion ringfenced for RD over the next four years
6646, We will ensure that the extra £24 billion that we have to invest in defence is spent wisely and appropriately
6647," We will also ensure that, as we made clear in the IR, with that £24 billion of extra investment in defence, we will have the armed forces that we require to deter and defend"
6648," Friend the Secretary of State for Levelling Up will be setting out a route by which the British peoplenot just the family reunion route, which can run into the hundreds of thousands, but a route by which everybody in this countrycan offer a home to people fleeing Ukraine"
6649," In 2010, a Conservative party came into power, in the coalition Government, that had argued before the election for more spending on everything in defence, but then, suddenly, they got into a programme of austerity, under the cloud of a mythical £38 billion black hole that the bad Labour Government had left them"
6650," I welcome things like the national shipbuilding strategy, but I am appalled that, even this week, the MOD has given a £10 million contract to a Dutch yard for a vessel that could have been built here"
6651," As a result, we need to look at absolute numbers in respect of what we need to invest in defence to achieve the things we want to achieve we must not be hung up on a particular percentageofGDP target, because that is going to be a moving feast and I think we will, unfortunately, be in a fairly major recession before too long"
6652," In June 2021, the National Audit Office published a report entitled, Improving the Performance of Major Equipment Contracts, because it was picking up on a catalogue of failures, of late delivery, of equipment being delivered that was not fit for purpose, and of contracts going hundreds of millionssometimes billions of pounds over budget"
6653," We identified, for example, that the contract for four Astuteclass attack submarines was more than £1 billion above budget and the Queen Elizabethclass aircraft carriers were £2"
6654,75 billion over budget
6655," It is easy to look at those numbers in the context of the total MOD budget and say that none individually is a huge percentage, but when we think what £3 billion, £4 billion or £5 billion could do to improve the accommodation that service personnel are living in, for example, and what that would do for morale, that waste of public money is simply inexcusable"
6656," I could talk until 7 oclock, if the right hon"
6657,"5 billion of additional funding to address the backlog in maintenance and repairs of that accommodation, which at the time was estimated to be about £1"
6658,5 billion
6659," I think it is dishonest to state as a matter of fact that the equipment plan is affordable, because in order for it to be affordable, as the NAO report states in paragraph 2"
6660,"7, £3 billion of financial risk was not included"
6661," For example, a future combat air system had an estimated cost in its business case up to 2031 of between £10 billion and £17 billion"
6662, The equipment plan allocates £8
6663,"65 billion, so that one project alone is, at best, underfunded by £1"
6664,"35 billion, and at worst it has possibly been allocated barely half the money it will cost"
6665,17 refers to £7 billion of what the MOD terms Planned Cost ReductionsI think this is what the right hon
6666," At the time, according to that report, the toplevel budget holders had plans to deliver less than half of the £3"
6667,1 billion
6668, Some £2
6669,"6 billion of it needed to be achieved by 2025, within the first four years, and the first of those first four years is up in three weeks time"
6670," It cannot afford to get it wrong this time, but I think we all know that the chances of it getting it right and delivering that £7 billion, if its past record is anything to go by, are very slight"
6671," An independent assessment carried out by the MODs cost assurance and analysis service, looking at projects that make up about 58% of the current years planalthough clearly there will be bigger expenditure on some of them laterreckoned that those projects alone were likely to cost £7"
6672,6 billion more than was assumed in the makeup of the defence equipment plan
6673,5% budget increase every year up to 2031
6674," It is costing billions and billions of pounds that the MOD simply cannot afford to waste, and there will be times when it risks costing the lives of our service personnel"
6675, The first is on the continual debate about percentage spending
6676, We should always remember that 2% is the minimum we are expected to spend on defence by NATO
6677, We now need to look very much at what that 2% is
6678," What does the 2% mean when it comes to UK defence spending A 2016 report by the Defence Committee called Shifting the goalposts showed that now the 2% includes war pensions, contributions to United Nations peacekeeping, pensions for retired civilian MOD personnel and MOD income, among other things"
6679," Fair enough, if that is to be included in defence spending, that is to be included in defence spending, but we should not for one minute assume that if we are saying we are spending 2% of GDP on defence, it is being spent on defence equipment or on personnel; it now covers a far bigger, wider range of things than it used to when we were calculating what we were contributing to the overall NATO budget"
6680, We must remember that people such as President Putin are the direct descendants of the regime whose ideology led them to kill millions of their own people in the decades in which Leninism and bolshevism held sway
6681," It is a fact that, in the aftermath of the Korean war, defence spending as a proportion of GDP at one point was as high as 7%"
6682," In about 1963, it crossed over with spending on welfare at 6%"
6683," That was all a long time ago, but as recently as the 1980s the spending on health, education and defence was roughly the same at just over 4% of GDP"
6684,I do agree with that point; using GDP percentages has always been only a very rough and ready guide
6685,1% on the old method of calculation and 3
6686,"6% on the new method of calculation, whereby the MOD is allowed to include certain things we never used to include, it then became an argument as to whether we would even manage to achieve 2% of GDP"
6687," Our expectations have been managed down so far that when, even in recent times, a number of us have called for 3% to be a target, it was regarded as being completely out of reach"
6688," The sort of effort we put into defending this country is the most important investment we can make, so 3% of GDP should now be seen not as a target or as a minimum, but as a stepping stone on the way to a realistic investment to meet the threat that never really went away, the reality of which in Ukraine has now been proclaimed for all the world to see"
6689," I found the IR quite frustrating, because the focus was on not making bad press announcements about the removal of regiments, although we have obviously heard the example of 2 Mercian"

6693," May I make two requests from that First, it is reported that there are many thousands of unaccompanied Ukrainian children across the border, who have been taken there for safety, and that the number is growing"
6694," We supplied them with 2,000 antitank missiles before the invasion, and I welcome what he said in his statement about what we are doing today"
6695," The initial supply was to be 2,000 new light antitank weapons, small arms and ammunition"
6696," I can update the House that, as of today, we have delivered 3,615 NLAWs and continue to deliver more"
6697," To date, the international community has donated more than 900 manportable air defence missiles and thousands of antitank guided weapons of varying types, as well as various small arms"
6698," Today the estimated number of Ukrainian civilians killed or injured stands at more than 1,000, but the true figure is expected to be much higher, and I am afraid that worse is likely to come"
6699," It is for that reason that the UK will increase its funding for Ukraine to £220 million, which includes £120 million of humanitarian aid"
6700," We have put over 1,000 more British troops on readiness to support humanitarian responses in the bordering countries"
6701,I agree 100% with my hon
6702," If there is a message from the House, which seems to be in agreement, it is that we need to spend more on defenceup to 3%and to reverse the cuts, before it is too late, to the infantry"
6703," In the light of Russias invasion, Germany has announced an increase in its defence spending, including a 100 billion fund to upgrade its armed forces"
6704," I do not want the impression to be abroad that Private Stone, doubling forward by half section with his Carl Gustaf, made a huge contribution to the defence of the realm"
6705," The only question is whether we end up at 3% quickly or slowly, because I think that that will be the direction of travel"
6706, There will be a great deal of support from Conservative Members for moving from 2%however the figures were added uptowards 3% or more
6707," He has designated a oneoff sum of 100 billion to set up a special fund, and has pledged an annual 2% of GDP"

6709,"3%, the Army had an uplift of 25"
6710,2% and the RAF had an uplift of 8
6711,2%
6712," One of the things that came up when we were having the debate around foreign aid was whether we should look at certain reforms, and if we return to 0"
6713,"7%, I would really like us to look at ways in which some of that money could be spent through the Ministry of Defence to support our armed forces to undertake humanitarian missions"
6714,"In commending the Government for their robust response to this dreadful invasion and notwithstanding existing levels of support and our article 5 commitment to NATO, the Government are right to rule out a nofly zone and also to emphasise that it is a difficult balance to ensure that any defensive support is calibrated not to escalate matters to a strategic level"
6715," Friend will agree that Poland is making a huge humanitarian effort, supporting hundreds of thousands of refugees and proposing military support"
6716,"In February this year we put a further £250 million into the Executive to allow them more flexibility, on top of their underspend, to support people at a time when there are such pressures"
6717,I am afraid that is the $60 million question
6718," Does he agree that we are not going to deter further Russian adventurism with a £4 billion light tank that not only does not work, but deafens its own crew"
6719," I challenged the Minister before Christmas as to whether his Department was going to give a £10 million contract to Damen in the Netherlands for a special naval vehicle, and he said we should wait for the competition"
6720," Some 36% of those 80,000 people were living in accommodation rated grade 4 or below"
6721," At a cost of about £150 million per aircraft, the fleet of 14 would have cost £2"
6722,"1 billion, comparable to the amount of money that the MOD has wasted on writeoffs since 2010"
6723," Some examples that Labour has uncovered are simply embarrassing, such as £64 million wasted on admin errors"
6724," and gallant Members how much they would like to see numbers in the Army go up, but they do not talk so much about the cost of the Defence Nuclear Organisation, which is 50% higher than that of the next department, the Army"
6725," Gentlemans remarks, and we believe the £4 billion figure is wholly spurious"
6726,There was a report from Reuters yesterday that dozens of former Paras have signed up for the Ukrainian foreign legion and that hundreds more are expected to do so
6727," Will the Secretary of State say a little more about the 1,000 UK troops who I understand from his statement are still on standby to provide humanitarian assistance Where are they and under what circumstances will they be deployed"
6728," Nevertheless, the commitment to article 5 is important"
6729," Also, one way the Ukrainians are delivering close air supportor, actually,  fires in depthis through the Turkish TB2 unmanned aerial vehicles, which are delivering munitions to their artillery and, indeed, their supply lines, which are credibly important, in order to slow down or block the Russian advance"

6736,I am not sure I am in a position to give betting odds in terms of percentages
6737," These are political decisions that have been taken, and nearly 30% of our procurement is now bought off the shelf from the United States, with no commitment from companies such as Boeing to reinvest to ensure that not only jobs but technology stay in the UK"
6738," She is absolutely right to make the point that men are 99% of the problem, but we can be 50% of the solution"
6739," We are ranked as the 45th country in the world for the proportion of women in Parliament, and only 36% of our councillors are women"

6744," Last year, less than 2% of rape cases ended in conviction, adding insult to injury for survivors who find the strength to come forward and report rapewhich only one in six women actually do, because they mistrust the system"
6745," Although such a measure would not be a silver bullet, there are many reasons why it would mean progress it would allow for the more accurate collection of data on harassment and make the collection of such data mandatory; it would set a precedent that such behaviour is unacceptable; it would curb the street harassment that 68% of all women experience on a near daily basis;  and it would stamp out lowlevel behaviour based on misogyny so that it would not lead to much more serious offences based on misogyny"
6746," This violence affects 51% of the populationwomen who work, women who vote, women watching as we fail to do anything at all to reduce these horrific statistics"

6750," More than 60% of women accessing mental health services have experienced domestic abusean appalling statistic at the heart of the Womens Aid campaign, DeserveToBeHeard, rightly promoted by my hon"
6751, That is one of many reasons why we have committed to guarantee mental health treatment within a month for all who need it and enable 1 million more people to access treatment
6752," Friend the Member for Coventry North West Taiwo Owatemi has repeatedly emphasised, black women are now 40% more likely than white women to experience miscarriage and four times more likely to die while pregnant, yet we still lack any hard targets for improvement"
6753," Womenled small and mediumsized enterprises contribute about £85 billion to economic output, and companies in which women are more prominent are ultimately more successful, yet women are still less likely to be able to access as much finance as men when they try to set up companies, and only eight of the FTSE 100s chief executive officers are women"
6754," It disrupts essentials services such as health and education that so many women and girls rely on, and it leads to the displacement of millions of people"
6755," According to the domestic violence charity Sistah Space, 86% of women of African or Caribbean heritage in the UK have either been a victim of domestic abuse or know a family member who has been assaulted"
6756," Sadly, we now have to dedicate half our programme to resilience and selfcare given the levels of online abuse that women standing for office can expect to face"

6790, By tackling childcare we can perhaps unleash the productivity of half the population even further

6820," It is a vision of a supercharged sector with thousands of highly skilled workers; a vision to make this the country of choice for specialist commercial and naval vessels and systems, components and technologies; a vision that generates the increased investment to level up our nation; and a vision that will spark a British shipbuilding renaissance and inspire even more countries to seek out that madeinBritain stamp"

6854,"I also welcome this scheme, and my constituents have been contacting me about what they can do to provide such accommodation, but can I gently remind the Secretary of State that there are still thousands of women, activists, prosecutors, judges and others in Afghanistan who are still waiting to hear from the Afghan resettlement scheme Will this type of scheme include those people in a further rollout"

6871," The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the Home Office have also been providing humanitarian support on the ground to Ukraines neighbours, helping them to cope with the displacement of hundreds of thousands of peoplebut more can, and must, be done"
6872," In recognition of their generosity, the Government will provide a monthly payment of £350 to sponsors for each family whom they look after"
6873," Indeed, Lord Harrington and I met them in order to ensure that we can expedite phase 2 as quickly as possible, and we will update the House in real time over the next few days"
6874,"The Secretary of State says he hopes that many people will be ready to open their home, but it seems that, due to Home Office guidance, none of the 3,000plus spare rooms offered to Afghan refugees by hosts across the UK has been used"
6875,"The Bill is much improved following its passage through the Lords and the scrutiny carried out in this House, not least by the addition of new clause 1, which was tabled by the Secretary of State on Report and addressed at least some of the concerns expressed about the devolution settlement"
6876,"I do not intend to detain the House for long, but it is a pleasure to rise to speak in support of Plaid Cymrus new clause 5, which would require the Secretary of State or the Lord Chancellor to obtain the consent of the devolved Governments when acting in areas of devolved competence"
6877," On the face of it, that would be an improvement to the existing position, but it is still something of a halfway house that causes confusion"
6878, 1590
6879,"I beg to move, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 1"
6880," We will be giving greater executive power to a Prime Minister who, in defiance of the security services, ennobled the son of a former KGB officer turned billionaire Russian oligarch, a Prime Minister whose career three weeks ago was hanging by a thread and who has been revealed to be up to his neck in dirty Russian money, and a Prime Minister who is currently under investigation by the Metropolitan police"
6881,"The UK Government have given the Saudi regime an estimated £20 billion in arms sales since the start of the war in Yemen, despite clear breaches of humanitarian law"
6882, Will he direct his officials to go even faster on phase 2 of the scheme so that we get this rolled out as quickly as possible
6883,"I will speak to new clauses 3 and 4 tabled in my name, then briefly come back to the Government amendment and to amendment 3"
6884," Due to do the increased number of regulators in scope, the Government also had to publish an updated impact assessment, with the total cost to regulators increasing by almost £2 million"
6885, The provisions in clauses 3 and 4 will allow for the implementation of regulatortoregulator mutual recognition agreements and of the recognition arrangements in new international trade agreements
6886," That is why I tabled new clause 4, which would oblige the Secretary of State to provide guidance to regulators on how to make the most of the provisions in the TCA"
6887," I see from new clause 1, having read it a number of times, that it is consistent with what is in the internal market Act and I thank the Minister for listening to the concerns that we raised, even though the Government voted against our amendments in Committee"
6888," Members on that, and I trust that the Government will still seek consent, in the spirit of new clause 1, when applying the regulations that are relevant to the devolved Administrations"
6889, Member for Richmond Park Sarah Olney that we will be supporting amendment 3
6890," 83A7,"
6891," Friend is not pressing his amendment to a vote, but the Government could still accept new clause 5 so that we could fix this situation and deal with it"
6892, Through the spending review and the record £2
6893,"6 billion of investment in special school places, that will be delivered"
6894,"The Saudi Arabian public investment fund is a significant investor, having invested billions in the UK and other western markets"
6895, New clause 1 would place a duty on the Secretary of State or Lord Chancellor to consult the devolved Administrations before making regulations under the Bill that contain provisions that could be made under the Bill by the devolved authorities themselves
6896, Amendment 1 seeks to amend the Government of Wales Act 2006 so that a Minister of the Crowns consent is not needed for Senedd Cymru to remove the Secretary of States and the Lord Chancellors ability to make regulations under the Bill that are within the Senedds legislative competence
6897," There is no due process in the Saudi justice system, in which there is widespread use of torture, and 75% of executions are for nonlethal offences"
6898, They say that their actions two and half years ago were the right ones but there were too many safeguards preventing them from getting their way
6899,"Will the Minister confirm that, if we dismiss Lords amendment 1 today, the courts will not have a role in fixing the dates for elections, because, surely, that is matter for us, answerable to the electors"
6900," Lords amendment 1 is, therefore, with the greatest possible respect, without merit"
6901,"A recent survey by the Disabled Childrens Partnership and Let Us Learn Too revealed that 60% of families with disabled children have sought mental health support because of the stresses of having to fight for basic services, while previous surveys have shown that nine in 10 disabled children are socially isolated"

6905," This morning, the chief executive of the Welsh Refugee  Council said that the scheme is not a humanitarian response, particularly in comparison with other European countries that have accepted hundreds of thousands of people"
6906," What plans and measures are in place to support families moving into longerterm housing Will the £350amonth scheme be considered for other refugees, which might be more culturally appropriate"
6907," As was pointed out earlier, 4,000 visas have been granted and the numbers are due to surge this week"
6908," The £350 is there for individuals, but charities and community groups will have a vital role to play in helping to marshal individual offers"
6909," Ladys question, because I can update the House that, since the website went live less than an hour ago, 1,500 people have already registered through the scheme in order to provide support"
6910," It is an ageold argument, and an issue that has launched a thousand dissertationsit was one of the major reasons for the 2011 Actbut it has become only more salient since then"
6911, It is important to recognise that the 1
6912,9 million devices that were provided by the Department during the course of the pandemic were on top of around 2
6913,"9 million devices already with schools, so the kit is out there to do this"
6914," He has answered many of the questions that arose over the weekend, but may I press him specifically on when he expects phase 2 to start and what work is already going on with nongovernmental organisations Those organisations make the point that they have many people who have already been checked by the Disclosure and Barring Service, but the volunteers coming forward in my constituency tend not to have been"
6915," Certainly the 1,700 of us who stood together in Winchester cathedral on Saturday with our prayers for Ukraine are very appreciative"
6916," Secondly, as I mentioned, the Scottish Government have suggested that they could act as a supersponsor for 3,000, and we are working with them"
6917,"I also welcome this scheme, and my constituents have been contacting me about what they can do to provide such accommodation, but can I gently remind the Secretary of State that there are still thousands of women, activists, prosecutors, judges and others in Afghanistan who are still waiting to hear from the Afghan resettlement scheme Will this type of scheme include those people in a further rollout"
6918,  Ofcoms recent affordability report found that 1
6919,1 million households are struggling to afford broadband

6927," Amendment 3, which we will be pressing to a vote, would require the Secretary of State to ensure that there are representatives for each of the devolved nations on the centres board"
6928," I will whip through each amendment in turn, starting with new clause 2"
6929, Member for Sefton Central is assured that we share the priority highlighted by new clause 4
6930," As of this morning, only 4,000 have been issued"
6931," Can he confirm that, if households are taking on a family or individual registered with a community support charitysuch as the Pickwell Foundation in North Devon, which has a proven track record of providing a warm, safe and sustainable welcome to refugeesthey will still receive the £350 a month"

6952, Member for Richmond Park Sarah Olney that we will be supporting amendment 3
6953," Sir Bill Wiggin, on behalf of the Committee of Selection"
6954," It promised young people 250,000 jobs and got barely half of that"
6955, Friend agree that the way to recovery for our economy and the cost of living is the multibillion pound plan for jobs that the Government are delivering
6956," That is lower than the 250,000 jobs that the scheme could have funded, but the scheme was designed at a time when unemployment was expected to peak at 12%"
6957," Friend the Chancellor, the economy has recovered better than expected and unemployment peaked at 5"
6958,2% in 2020
6959," In total, the Department for Work and Pensions spend on labour market support will be more than £6 billion over the next three years"
6960," The DWPs youth offer, which runs until 2025 and is worth £60 million, includes a 13week youth employment programme, supported youth hubs and, crucially, specialised youth employability coaches"
6961," The National Farmers Union sees it as a particular problem and estimates that some 1,100 quad bikes are stolen from farms each year, costing farmers upwards of £3 million"
6962," If just a fraction of those end up on public roads, that is hundreds of illegal quads running rampant on our streets"
6963," There were over 10,000 reports of antisocial use of quads and bikes in West Yorkshire in 2021, a shocking 42% rise on the previous year"
6964, Just one antisocial quad rider ripping through a neighbourhood will disturb hundreds and hundreds of residents
6965," That can take hundreds and hundreds of hours of police time, piecing together official reports from members of the public, scouring community intelligence on social media or reviewing CCTV from businesses such as petrol stations for that one frame showing the riders face, all to make a strong enough case to act"
6966, The Government will invest £3
6967,"8 billion in skills by 202425, which is equivalent to a cash increase of 42% compared with 201920"
6968," On apprenticeships, I am happy to say that last year more than 3,000 people started apprenticeships in my hon"
6969,"With the leave of the House, we will take motions 3 to 5 together"
6970,"Businesses in the steel industry are more likely to be able to support the kickstart scheme if the Government manage to get Donald Trumps unfair tariffs of 25% on British steel exports lifted, as the Japanese and the EU have already achieved"
6971," However, moving on, the Chancellor really listened when he moved to make sure that the taper rate was reduced to 55% in the autumn Budget; that is ongoing, and it recognises the principle of universal credit that people will be better off working than not working"
6972," Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer is a multimillionaire who has no idea what it is like to get by on poverty, as many of my constituents and those on these Opposition Benches do, has she suggested that he should follow the Scottish Governments approach of uprating benefits by 6% with a fixed budget Is that something she is planning to ask him to do on Wednesday, or is it going to be more of the same from her Departmentno action"
6973,"Most benefits and the state pension will rise by just 3% in April, but inflation could be over 8%, so that is a realterms cut of 5% for people who are already having to choose between eating and heating"
6974,The Government are providing support worth over £21 billion across this financial year and the next to help families with the cost of living
6975," Has the Secretary of State urged the Chancellor to reverse the £20 universal credit cut and rule it out to legacy claimants, or has she asked to replicate the Scottish Governments £20 per week child payment Where is her comprehensive plan to stop our constituents sufferingand by plan I do not mean more loans"
6976," We will be filling half a million new jobs by the summer through our Way to Work campaign; that will help people progress, and I hope the hon"
6977,"We know we are at record levels of inwork poverty, with more than 8 million people in that category, so why are three out of four people who were in lowpaid work in 2010 still in lowpaid work now"
6978," In fact, research by York University has found that securing  child maintenance payments would lift 60% of children living in singleparent households that currently are not receiving them out of poverty"
6979, 2
6980, That is partly because the message has gone out to all the many hundreds of thousands who might have been tempted that it is not worth trying
6981,"The windups will begin at 12 minutes past 4, as the Minister has kindly agreed to truncate his windup to get more time in"
6982," At roughly 18 minutes past 4, we are expecting multiple Divisions"
6983,"I call Alison Thewliss, whom I must ask to sit down at 4"
6984," Giving £54 million to the French to do something about this; making constant requests, which have been rebuffed, for meetings with the French Interior Minister and otherswhere have the Government not tried to engage constructively How would the hon"
6985," Let us be clear that the UK has designated more than 1,000 individuals, entities and subsidiaries under the Russia sanctions regime since the invasion, including President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov"
6986, More than 3 million Russian companies are barred from raising money on UK capital markets
6987, What people are asking me is this what are we doing to get some money back from Fujitsu This will cost the taxpayer potentially hundreds of millions of pounds
6988," To be clear, in the past week the Government have passed the Economic Crime Transparency and Enforcement Act 2022, established a register of beneficial ownership, and sanctioned more than 1,000 individuals and entities"
6989," Evidence from programmes such as Justice and Cares victim navigator programme shows that when given wraparound support over a longer period more victims develop the confidence to engage with criminal investigations; 89% of Justice and Cares supported victims engaged with police at the last published evaluation, which compared with the national average of about a third"
6990," That 48% were criminally exploited, so we must ensure that children who have been victims of county lines gangs have protection"
6991," To demonstrate how difficult it still is to have your migration status resolved upon recognition of your exploitation, data obtained from the Home Office shows that in 201920 only 2%, or 17 out of 754, of child victims of modern slavery in the UK were granted discretionary leave to remain"
6992," That would have a considerable impact, given that 91% of conclusive grounds decisions made in 2021  were positive, which means the Home Office deemed the individuals to be confirmed victims of modern slavery"
6993," The most recent number of referrals to the NRM was 12,727, representing a 20% increase in referrals compared to the previous yearthe highest number of referrals since the NRM began"
6994," I express on behalf of the whole House our sympathy with his family, friends and colleagues on this sad anniversary"
6995," I especially support Lords amendment 4, which removes the licence given to the Home Secretary to deprive British people of their citizenship without informing them"
6996," I also support Lords amendment 5, which seeks to ensure that the Bill does not violate the UKs shared international obligations under the refugee convention"
6997," Lords amendment 6, which removes from the Bill the power given to the Home Secretary to treat people differently according to the way that they arrive and claim asylum, must also be adopted to prevent a twotier system that would limit protection for refugees due not to their need but to their method of travel"
6998," Lords amendments 8 and 9 are steps in the right direction, yet they do not go far enough to prevent asylum seekers from being transferred to other countries and processed offshore"
6999," I wholeheartedly support Lords amendment 54, which prohibits the use of new maritime powers contained in schedule 6 in ways that would endanger life at sea"
7000,"The events in Ukraine in the past month have shown how quickly millions of lives can be thrown into chaos by war and  violence, and how individuals can find themselves dependent on asylum or sanctuary afforded by other countries"
7001," I also associate myself with Lords amendments 9, 52 and 53, which would remove from the Bill the Governments inhumane powers to make it easier to remove a person to a safe third country while their asylum claim is pending"
7002,"Does the Minister agree that amendment 6 is a huge slap in the face for all those people who play by the rules and engage in proper legal processes to get to this country, whether they are a refugee or not"
7003," Many amendments were passed in the other place, but for the sake of time, I will focus on Lords amendments 4, 9, 10 and 13"
7004, Clause 9 is one of the most chilling parts of the Bill
7005," Friend the Member for Aberavon Stephen Kinnock, and other Opposition Members, in Australia the offshore processing cost is estimated to be Aus $1 billion a year to deal with 300 migrants"
7006," The truth is that even once claims have been processed and around 40% have been found not to be valid, people rarely leave because of a combination of irresponsible activists, fatcat lawyers and the Human Rights Act, which needs to be ditched as soon as possible"
7007," Let us remember that 89% of Iranian asylum seekers  have their claims granted, 97% of Eritreans, and 96% of Sudanese, none of whom have a legal route"
7008," Lord Kirkhopes amendment 9 strips out the Governments plans to create an offshore asylumprocessing system, and I believe he is right"
7009, Australia ended up spending over £1 million per person detained offshorearound £4
7010,"3 billion for 3,127 asylum seekers"
7011, Members that there are 84 million refugees globally
7012," Millions have been displaced because of conflict and persecution and are seeking safe passage, including Syrian Kurds, Afghans and Yemenis, who have suffered the worlds worst humanitarian crisis 20 million are in need of humanitarian aid"
7013," However, the Home Office data confirms that 87% of those arriving by small boats in 2021 comprised nationals from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen, for whom there is currently no alternative legal and safe route by which they can apply to get to the UK, so it is pointless the Minister saying that he believes in accessible routes"
7014,It seems that amendment 7 goes to the heart of what we are talking about today
7015," That is why I rise today to support amendments 4 to 9, especially amendment 6"
7016," There is no such thing as an illegal refugee in international law, yet that is exactly what the new group 2 category attempts to establish"
7017," However, the Government are scrapping humanitarian protection as we know it and aligning it instead with the new group 2 status, meaning regular visa reviews every two and a half years compared with every five, no recourse to public funds, no right to work, restricted family visa rights and no route to indefinite leave to remain"
7018, Clause 11 is out of tune with the hundreds of thousands of people who have come forward to help Ukrainian refugees
7019," Gentleman reflect for a moment on the fact that there are 1 million refugees in Bangladesh, many hundreds of thousands in Uganda and over 1 million in Poland Many countries around the world, which are very poor and have very little infrastructure, have taken in far more refugees than any European country"
7020," Members that we will continue to uphold our international obligations and ensure that any removal is compliant with our obligations under the refugee convention and article 3 of the European convention on human rights, which protects against torture and inhuman and degrading treatment"
7021," There were 1,131 refugees resettled in the UK through that scheme in the year ending December 2021"
7022," We have granted over 40,000 refugee family reunion visas since 2015, of which more than half were granted to children"
7023," In 2021, there were 6,134 family reunion visas issued, which was an increase of 28% on the previous year"
7024," Again, more than half were issued to children"
7025," Through that route, we have relocated more than 7,000 locally employed staff and their family members since April 2021, in addition to 1,400 former staff and families who were relocated under the previous ex gratia scheme for Afghan interpreters"
7026," Even with a cap on the number of individuals, we can expect many thousands of applications, which UK caseworkers would need to assess individually to determine whether each individual belongs to the specific group found to be at risk"
7027," During its reign of terror, Daesh raped, murdered or sold into sexual slavery thousands of women, and sent young boys to its terrorist training camps"
7028," Let us not forget that 70% of the individuals who are currently making that channel crossing are men, predominantly single men in their 20s and 30s"
7029," The number of desperate asylum seekers risking their lives by crossing the channel on small boats has increased from 299 in 2018 to an eyewatering 28,526 in 2021, of whom more than 3,000 were children"
7030," Gentleman is referring to offshoring, but as we have seen, offshoring does not work it is costing millions and millions in Australia and every expert is panning the idea"
7031," We therefore support Lords amendment 54, which adds language to schedule 6, stating that these enforcement powers must never put lives at risk"
7032," We therefore support Lords amendment 5, which would add a new clause stating that nothing in the Bill must authorise policies which do not comply with the refugee convention"
7033, We currently have thousands of Afghan refugees stuck in hotels
7034," The Lords amendment would also prevent asylum seekers from being forced into the dangerous net of the blackmarket economy just to survive, which is so often more attractive to them than relying on £38 per week from the Government"
7035," We are pleased to see that more than 66 Conservative parliamentarians, including 27 members of this House, have signed a letter to the Home Secretary expressing support for Lords amendment 7, and we encourage Ministers to see the light and follow suit"
7036," Of the 8,593 notices of intent to deem people inadmissible that were issued in 2021, incredibly, only 64 were upheld"
7037," This policy simply increases the enormous backlog further and is a complete waste of money, so we support Lords amendment 8"
7038," The latest ludicrous suggestion is that Ascension Island, 4,500 miles away in the South Atlantic, should be used for the purpose"
7039," This is why the Labour Party supports Lords amendment 9, which removes offshoring from the Bill"
7040," It is still too vague, and we will be pushing Lords amendment 4 to a vote"
7041," The Government know it as well, which is why they cannot even accept Lords amendment 5, a simple amendment that would require powers in part 2 to be exercised in accordance with the refugee convention"
7042," So Lords amendment 6, which deletes clause 11, must be left in place"
7043," So we support Lords amendments 9, 52 and 53"
7044," If that is not enough, perhaps Members should consider the billions of pounds such a system will cost, while achieving nothing"
7045," As I have said a million times in the House, once that funding is in place the hon"
7046," Offshoring is going to cost billions of pounds, there is no sensible argument in favour of it and we need to get rid of it as soon as we can"
7047, Lords amendment 7 is a simple but powerful example
7048, We therefore pay tribute to all the campaigners behind Lords amendment 7
7049," Unless that can be fixed, we continue to believe that Lords amendment 4 is the best solution"
7050,1 Proceedings on consideration of Lords Amendments shall so far as not previously concluded be brought to a conclusion six hours after their commencement
7051,3 Any further Message from the Lords may be considered forthwith without any Question being put
7052," Can he outline what that means in practice Is it just reimbursing the legal costs, or will we have a more sophisticated scheme Certainly, my constituent Tom Brown, who paid back £84,000 that he did not need to pay, is £84,000 out of pocket"
7053, Friend for all the work that she has done on behalf of her constituent Tracy Felstead and the 554 other postmasters
7054," On where we are with the compensation, I can announce that as of 11 March, 45% of people in the historical shortfall scheme had already received offers"
7055," That amounts to 1,067 individuals"
7056, The Post Office reports that it is firmly on track to make 95% of initial offers by the end of the year
7057,"That is the last question, so I will say that although the last three quarters of an hour have been my moment in the sun, it is not about me it is about the 555"
7058," They begged and borrowed £70,000 from friends and families to fill a shortfall that they could not understand, but which we now knowand the Post Office probably knew at the timewas not a shortfall at all"
7059, 1684
7060," Indeed, a YouGov poll showed that 81% of people who were asked agreed with the principle of allowing asylum seekers the right to work"
7061," Member for Hayes and Harlington John McDonnell mentioned a figure of £200 million, and the potential revenue is certainly in the hundreds of millions"
7062," When we put on the other side of the balance the fact that asylum accommodation costs £350 million a year, we can start to see why the numbers add up"
7063," There are 324,963 signatures to a petition about clause 9, and I pay tribute to all those who have campaigned on it"
7064, We will be voting for Lords amendment 4 today
7065," In my constituency, I have two detention centres, which house nearly 1,000 people"
7066," There are 1,700 asylum seekers in hotels in my constituency as well"
7067, They are told to live off £5
7068," All Lords amendment 7 said was, Just allow these people to workallow them to support themselves and their families, and to give something back to this country"
7069, At least £200 million would be put into our economy
7070," There is an argument that allowing employment will somehow add to the pull factor, but having to live off £5"
7071,40 a day is not the sort of pull factor that will attract millions to this country
7072, That is why Lords amendment 7 needs to be looked at more rationally
7073," Members to contemplate that, to look at Lords amendment 7, and to think again"
7074," In 2019, 2"
7075,245 million visitors came to the island of Ireland and spent £589 million
7076, There has been a 90% increase in the number of visitors to the island of Ireland from North America and 60% of all visitors to the island spend nights in both the Republic and the north of Ireland
7077," There are tens of thousands of movements each day on the island of Ireland involving Northern Ireland citizensfor the purposes of work or education, for example, and because people living in one part of the island may have business in the other jurisdiction"
7078," The quickest route from Dublin to Donegal is through Northern Ireland on the A5, and even someone making a very localised journey from Clones or Cavan town, for example, will cross the border four times in the course of that short journey"
7079, This contrasts with the hundreds of children who have been put in hotels and forced to share rooms and even beds with adult men they do not know
7080," Last year, 43% of victims referred to the national referral mechanism were children, with 31% of them being British, and the rise in county lines gangs is believed to be one of the biggest drivers of the rise in child referrals"
7081," If the Minister is not minded to strike part 5 from the Bill and work with the sector and us on genuine alternatives, he must protect children from the worst of the changes, which only put barriers between victims and the support and justice they need and deserve"
7082," In fact, in Committee during our discussions on part 5 alone the Minister referred to the statutory guidance a staggering 51 times when it is still to be published, which I must say made a mockery of parliamentary scrutiny"
7083," Given that 48% of victims of modern slavery in the UK last year were criminally exploited, that suggests that clause 62 has the potential to exclude almost half of all victims from support"
7084," 83F, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 1"
7085,"Recently, I was sent hundreds of Valentine cards from pupils at St Dunstans Primary School in my constituency, to my surprise; it is more than I have ever received"
7086," The situation in Ukraine is driving millions from their homes, many of whom have found refuge in neighbouring countries"
7087," Clause 11, concerning illegal entry into the UK, will criminalise those who do not arrive by regular routes, which for millions of refugees are simply not available"
7088, Will he publish an economic impact assessment on how many billions of pounds this will cost the taxpayer It has been promised for months
7089,"With the leave of the House, we will take motions 4, 5 and 6 together"
7090," 83A7,"
7091,"Motion made, and Question put, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 5"
7092,"Motion made, and Question put, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 9"
7093," Ladys record of Conservative interventions that are somewhat supportive, is not what she has just said about that 48% the answer to the question I posed to my hon"
7094," Friend the Minister Under the Bill as presented, the Home Office will be required to intervene in half the cases to make the very difficult judgment whether to exclude or not exclude"
7095," I think I have less than a minute and a half, so I will be brief"
7096,"Motion made, and Question put, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 4"
7097,"I rise to thank the Government sincerely for amendment 1, the Chagos nationality amendment"
7098," They have suffered an injustice of approximately half a century and the Government today have gone a significant way towards ensuring that those people who are descendants of British subjects rightly have the ability to apply for British overseas territories citizenship, and therefore ultimately British citizenship if they so wish"
7099,"I beg to move, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 1"
7100,"Mr Speaker, may I begin by joining in, on behalf of the Home Office, your tribute to PC Keith Palmer, who lost his life five years ago today All of us who were in the House will never forget that day"
7101," 83F, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 1"
7102," The Home Office confirms that 87% of the 28,000 arriving illicitly in 2021 came from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen, for whom there is currently no alternative legal and safe route to which they can apply to get to the United Kingdom"
7103," Much more sensible is to recruit and train several hundred new civil servants to process these claims more rapidly and, yes, to crack down on an overlengthy appeals process exploited through unscrupulous lawyers"
7104,"The east midlands freeport will see nearly £9 billion of new investment, and tens of thousands of new jobs created in our region"
7105, That is looking across England and Wales and will provide a crucial evidence base for part 2 of the Angiolini inquiry and inform any broader policy or legislative changes that might be required
7106," As someone who over the years has worked alongside the Met and seen at first hand the incredible things that they are capable of achieving, I know there are thousands of officers, staff and volunteers across the organisation who perform their duties with skill, professionalism and pride every day"
7107, Lady raised in the first half of her remarks will be addressed by Her Majestys inspectorate as it looks at vetting procedures across the whole country
7108," As someone who, like me, has an intimate knowledge of policing, I am sure he will acknowledge that there will be thousands of police officers up and down the land who are as disappointed and distressed by the revelations today as we are"
7109," They, and millions of Londoners, deserve leadership in the Met that they can trust and have confidence in, not leaders who have indifference to the risks of corruption"
7110,"A freeport in Wales, especially in Anglesey, sounds like a great idea, just like in Teesside, where the UKs largest and first postBrexit freeport has already led to the announcement of thousands of future jobs in new green technologies"
7111,2 Any further Message from the Lords may be considered forthwith without any Question being put
7112,1 Proceedings on consideration of Lords Amendments shall so far as not previously concluded be brought to a conclusion one hour after their commencement
7113,I thank the Minister on behalf of residents for his answer and for the UK Governments interest
7114,"The UK Government are committed to supporting the development of the floating offshore  wind industry in Wales, with £160 million of funding available for floating offshore wind ports and factories across the UK"
7115," Friend says, Channel 5 is 25 years old this month"
7116," Friend join me in celebrating Channel 5s team who had the imagination and confidence to do that then, and the current team who continue to bring understandable, relevant, and relatable news to people in all parts of the UK today"
7117,The A2
7118," Lady slightly, I believe the threshold will still rise by £300 in April, as was the Governments original plan"
7119,"I beg to move amendment 1, page 1, line 8, leave out July and insert April"
7120," Friends powerful representations on behalf of Blackpool, particularly with the levellingup agenda in mind"
7121," In its wisdom, it intends to split the A2 and M2 into two separate twolane highways midway between the A227 and Marling Cross"
7122," The outer two lanes will be for M2 traffic going down deeper into Kent; the inner two lanes will be for the A2 to Strood and the lower Thames crossing, and the Hoo peninsula"
7123," Not only will it cause dangerous weaving and accidents while the traffic tries to get into the correct lane, but the A2 will be narrowed to two lanes, which is completely inadequate for traffic heading towards the M2 at peak periods"
7124," In 2009, Highways England actually widened the A2 at  this point from three lanes to four lanes to cope with increased volumes, and now the proposal is to narrow it to two lanes"
7125, The cost of the project for central Government has increased from £3
7126,72 billion in 2016 to £8
7127,2 billion now
7128," We make these throwaway comments about billions, but imagine having a stack of a million £1 coins and then creating 8,200 stacks of £1 coins"
7129,4
7130," But in 2013, the costbenefit analysis supported the Dartford option and was against a crossing east of Gravesend, which then apparently provided a benefit of 1"
7131,1
7132," Anyway, at a new cost of £8 billion, any benefit must now be marginal at best"
7133," I can completely understand why that might not matter too much to Kent and Essex County Councils, because it is not money from their budgets, but it is the money of hundreds of millions of people who will remain sitting snarled in their cars in traffic jams at Dartford over the coming decades"
7134,2 billion and does not represent value for money for taxpayers
7135, Spending £8
7136,2 billion to build that white elephant will not address the current problems at Dartford
7137," There will still be oversized vehicles at red traffic lights, and hundreds of millions of people will still spend time stuck in traffic for the next three decades"
7138, When it does not address that problem and we have spent £8
7139,"2 billion on itI suspect the costs will go uppeople will rightly look at us and say, How on earth have you spent £8"
7140,"2 billion on a project that still means, on the very rare occasions when there is a catastrophic failure, that people end up having to sleep in IKEA That is a true fact once the congestion was so bad that nothing could move, IKEA opened its doors, and people slept in its beds and on its sofas"
7141," Friend the Member for Leeds West Rachel Reeves, whose windfall tax proposals would have helped those struggling to get by with a payment of up to £600 per household"
7142," The Chancellor and the Prime Minister had the opportunity to look at a number of policies, including a windfall tax on the energy companies, which would have offered up to £600 of muchneeded help"
7143, We are introducing a tax cut for a typical employee that is worth more than £330 in the year from July 2022
7144," Finally, we maintained the 8% higher rate of capital gains tax for landlords compared with the rate for other taxable gains"
7145,"I am wondering whether the Minister missed new clause 2, because she did not address the problem"
7146," People were being told yesterday that they should get an extra £330, but they will actually get less than half of that"
7147, What is the Government going to do about that The Treasury is clawing back several hundred million pounds from some of the poorest workers in the country
7148,"I rise to speak to amendment 1, tabled in my name and that of my hon"
7149,"25% increase in national insurance contribution payments without any protection through a higher taxfree allowance, and three months in which families will feel the full force of the Chancellors tax hike without any cushioning from the rising of the national insurance threshold"
7150, Mr Usmanov is clearly laughing at this Government; he has moved hundreds of millions of pounds into irrevocable trusts
7151,"I warmly congratulate Channel 5 on turning 25, along with Channel 4 on turning 40 and, of course, one of our greatest institutions, the BBC, which is celebrating its centenary in 2022"
7152, While the Government have been playing games with the future of the BBC and Channel 4and we welcome the extra funding for the World Servicetheir journalists have risked their lives to report the facts on the front line in Ukraine
7153," Will the Secretary of State give an assurance that any future ownership decisions that she makes on Channel 4 will ensure that its indepth, independent journalism will be protected beyond 2022"
7154,What recent assessment her Department has made of the contribution of Channel 5 to public service broadcasting
7155,"I congratulate Channel 5 on its 25th anniversary, and I was delighted to attend the parliamentary reception this week to celebrate that significant milestone"
7156," Channel 5 has played an important and awardwinning role in our public service broadcasting system, through its provision of new programming, and its unique focus on childrens television"
7157,"As I have said a number of times at the Dispatch Box, a decision has not yet been reached on the future of Channel 4"
7158," Lottery distributors are providing £22 million to help communities become involved, and there will be a series of events between 2 and 6 June, including a special Trooping the Colour event and a service of thanksgiving at St Pauls cathedral"
7159," The busy A2, which runs through the centre of my constituency, is the main road link to the existing crossing at Dartford  that is the problematic one we have heard aboutand the proposed crossing to the east of Gravesend"
7160,"I wish first to address amendment 1, which was tabled by the hon"
7161, Member for Bath Wera Hobhouse and would bring forward to 6 April the increase to the primary threshold that is introduced in clause 1
7162," Of course the Government want to help people with the cost of living as quickly as possible, which is why the Chancellor introduced a number of measures immediately, including the cutting of fuel duty, which came into force at 6 pm last night"
7163," Its delivery to an April timeline would see millions of individuals paying the incorrect amount of NICs at the start of the tax year, in just two weeks time"
7164, That will avoid millions of taxpayers having to make manual claims for refunds
7165," On the points that Members made about poverty, if we look back at the past 10 years, we see that around 1"
7166,"3 million fewer people are living in poverty, half a million fewer children are growing up in workless households and hundreds of thousands fewer children are living in poverty"
7167," He announced the first tax cut on his journey to cut taxationthe cutting of the taper rate, which will put £1,000 into the pockets of those on universal credit"
7168," They will have seen the £1 billion household support fund, which is helping people in all our constituencies, building on other measures that were announced at the autumn Budget"
7169," More recently, we have provided £9 billion in energy support"
7170," I reiterate that the changes that we have already made mean that those who are on universal credit will benefit by £1,000 from the cut to the taper rate"
7171,25%
7172,I want to speak to new clause 2
7173," As I pointed out to him in an intervention, there is an anomalyI hope it is onethat the Government will want to put right when those on universal credit who pay national insurance have their threshold raised to £12,500, the £330 that they gain as a consequence will be subject to the 55% taper"
7174," He announced a number of measures that increased the incomes of the poor, although we should remember that he took away the £20 a week uprating of universal credit"
7175, How can that be The poorest workers in the country number 2
7176,3 million; I suspect that what the Government  claw back from them will mean hundreds of millions going back to the Treasury
7177," By my calculationI will stand corrected if I am wrongsuch people will gain £330, of which they will lose £171, so the actual gain will be in the region of £159"
7178, Subsection 2 aims to find out how much the Government will gain from some of the poorest workers in the country because of the changes
7179, I note that the changes to the threshold for selfemployed peoples class 4 contributions take effect in two stages
7180," First, the lower profits limit is raised from £9,880 to £11,908 from April 2022, and then it is raised again to £12,570 in April 2023"
7181," The figure of £11,908 represents, as far as I can tell, a blended average for 202223 of the lower profits limit continuing at the level previously intended until July, and then being raised to £12,570 for the remaining months of the year"
7182," As with class 1 contributions, we will therefore have three months during which the Chancellors NI hike will be in place and hitting peoples pockets, yet the changes to the threshold will not yet have taken effect"
7183, This clause also enables the Treasury to make sure that selfemployed people with profits between the small profit threshold and the lower profits limit will continue to be able to build up NI credits but will not pay any class 2 national insurance contributions
7184," I would like, however, to press the Minister on two technical points that arise from clause 3"
7185," First, why are the changes to class 2 contributions to be made by way of regulations, rather than being implemented through this Bill I note that clause 53 seems to make it clear that regulations arising from clause 3 will, as they would amend Acts of Parliament, have to be laid before and approved by a resolution of each House"
7186," Will the Minister explain why the detail on clause 3 will therefore be decided a later stage, and not with the class 1 and class 4 changes today Secondly, clause 32b makes it clear that the changes to class 2 contributions may be made to have retrospective provision from 6 April 2022"
7187,1 billion and add to their distress right in the middle of the biggest cost of living crisis since the 1950s
7188, A nurse or a midwife on an average salary will see their tax bill rise by £310 next year
7189, A care home worker will pay around £140 more and ambulance staff will see a £420 increase
7190," The typical family will see a hit of £1,100 next year, according to the Resolution Foundation"
7191, Absolute poverty is set to rise by 1
7192,"3 million people, including 500,000 children"
7193," That is why the Chancellor should implement the changes in the Bill not from July, but from April, as that would save working families £2"
7194,1 billion in tax payments
7195, It would require the Government to produce a report to look at the impact of the 1
7196,25% increase in national insurance contributions on disposable incomes
7197,75%
7198," I wish to speak against amendment 1, in the name of the hon"
7199," Member for North East Fife Wendy Chamberlain, and against new clause 1, in the name of the right hon"
7200, Amendment 1 is simply impractical
7201,6% increase in the national living wage
7202,2 million people across the country
7203,"1 challenge facing my constituency is access to quality healthcare, which, as a former nurse and social worker, I understand acutely"
7204,"I tabled new clause 1 because, from now on, I do not think that the House should discuss any legislation that has financial consequences without it understanding or at least having information about the effect on poverty and low pay"
7205," At the moment, 4"
7206,3 million children and 2 million pensioners in the UK live in poverty
7207," Overall, 14 million people live in poverty, and that was before the cost of living crisis hit us"
7208," According to analysis today from the Resolution Foundation, 1"
7209,3 million more people will be living in poverty
7210," Child poverty is already up by more than 500,000 since 2010, and it is interesting to note that most of those childrenmore than 60%live in households in which one adult works"
7211,"1% will drag more than 400,000 more people into poverty, and as we have pointed out time and again during the debate, inflation is forecast to rise over the year to between 7% and 10%"
7212, A total of 4
7213,8 million workers earn less than the UK real living wage of £9
7214,"90 an hour, or £11"
7215, The rise in the minimum wage this yeara 6% rise to £9
7216,"50 still falls short of the Living Wage Foundations real living wage, and, given that forecast of an inflation rate between 7% and 10%, it is a realterms pay cut"
7217,2 per cent in 202223their largest financial year fall on record
7218," According to the IFS, public sector pay has fallen by 3% in real terms in the last year, and is 2% lower in real terms than it was 12 years ago"
7219," The Department for Educations average pay offer to teachers is 4%, and the fact that inflation is so much higher has obviously hit their wage levels"
7220,I do not want the Minister to miss the point of new clause 1
7221," Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell Chris Grayling, the then Transport Secretary, opted for Kent and Essexs preferred option, which will do nothing to ameliorate the situation at Dartford and will be yet another massive piece of Government spending on road infrastructure just at the moment in our history when roads are to be optimised by level 5 autonomous vehicles"
7222," The way I think of it is that if we look across the rooftops of London we see thousands of chimneys, none of them used any more"
7223, The lefthand one is 4
7224,8 metres high and the righthand one is 5 metres high
7225," They are the cause of the horrendous jams, because no fuel tankers or hazardous loads are permitted unescorted, and no vehicles over 5 metres high are permitted at all"
7226," Not only will Dartford be gridlocked, but so will Gravesend and the whole of the A2 eastbound from M25 junction 2"
7227," Some 42% of vehicles using the Dartford crossing are now goods vehicles, which has gone up from 33% in 2019"
7228,"3 miles of new road linking the M2A2, A13 and M25"
7229," By almost doubling road capacity across the River Thames east of London, it will cut traffic using the Dartford crossing by 22%, and will provide national road freight with a reliable new connection"
7230,5 million vehicles away from Dartford every year
7231,I would also like to extend my gratitude on behalf of the Department to Councillor Bob Lane for his engagement
7232," The tunnel itself has been lengthened by around 1 km, and the route has been lowered or hidden behind earth bunds"
7233," Now, around 50% of the route in Gravesham is in the tunnel and 80% of the entire route is hidden from view, either in tunnels or cuttings or behind earth bunds"
7234," Some improvements may well come from building a lower Thames crossing as proposed, because it will move some vehicles awayI cannot remember the current figure; I think it is about 22% of existing usebut the existing crossing will still be above design capacity"
7235," It is very costly, as we have heard, at £8"
7236,2 billion
7237," Friend the Member for Gravesham described his 8,200 towers of 1 million coins very aptly"
7238," The commitment one will have to make to the new crossing, as it is so far away from the existing crossing, means that thousands of vehicles will be beyond the point of no return, and my hon"
7239, Friend described junction 2of the A2 or the M2
7240," Will we actually need this capacity where it is proposed, or should we be having a rethink If this project goes ahead there are opportunities for businessesindeed, if any small businesses in Thurrock, Essex, Kent or Gravesham are not aware of this, there is a supply chain school, and large tier 1 contractors are looking for local businesses to help them deliver this"
7241," We will still get congestion at the existing Dartford crossing for all the reasons we have heard, and we will be back here trying to find a solution, having spent £8"
7242,"2 billion on something that might benefit those who want to get from Dover to Cambridge, but will not benefit those who want to get from Gravesham to Thurrock"
7243,3 miles of new roadbut there is an impact from that road on the communities that it will cut through
7244," There is no train link, for example, yet HS1 travels between Kent and Essex"
7245," Cabotage limits can add up to £16,000 a day"
7246," Those are substantial burdens, and most tours of UK orchestras are to Europe such tours represent 12% of their earned income"
7247," We have sanctioned more than 1,000 individuals and entities; there were 65 more announcements today"
7248," Friend was there on Channel 5s opening night, and so were the Spice Girls"
7249," Channel 5 does a huge amount for independent production companies, and one fifth of all its commissioning spending goes to those smaller companies"
7250," That is a larger spend than the BBC, Channel 4 and ITV"
7251,"On behalf of the numerous immunosuppressed people in Chesterfield and their families who have contacted me, I thank my hon"
7252, Somebody who I know and have been to football with over many years has not been to a game for two and a half years
7253," For example, provisions in the Act have helped the courts and tribunal system to keep functioning throughout the pandemic by allowing thousands of hearings to take place remotely"
7254, The Ministry of Justices spending review settlement has put £500 million into addressing the issue
7255," Since the Act was first introduced, we have made huge progress in our fight against the virus thanks to a national vaccination programme that has now put more than 140 million doses in arms"
7256," To be clear, sections 53 to 55 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 enable thousands of hearings to be conducted onlinecurrently around 11,000 per weekso that courts and tribunals can be reserved for hearings, such as trials, that must be heard in court"
7257,"I, too, put on record my enormous thanks to all the health and social care workers as well as the many unpaid carerswho have demonstrated extraordinary public service over the last couple of years, and also on a daily basis, day in day outfor the instances of love, care and medical attention for the thousands of people who have recovered, but also the 165,000 who did not"
7258, I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to the two motions before the House today on behalf of Her Majestys loyal Opposition
7259, It has certainly not gone anywhere for the 1
7260,"5 million people who are living with the symptoms of long covid, or the 800,000 clinically vulnerable and immunosuppressed people who continue to call on the Government for better clarity and access to antiviral and retroviral treatment"
7261," Almost 15,000 nurses, midwives and, in England, nursing associates joined these temporary registers to help deal with the impact of the pandemic, as well as more than 10,000 paramedics, operating department practitioners and other professionals, and about 6,500 social workers"
7262,7 million jobs
7263," We have also supported the selfemployment income support scheme, which paid out more than £28 billion to nearly 3 million selfemployed people and was one of the most generous schemes for the selfemployed in the world"
7264, We made 5 million doses of antivirals available for the immunosuppressed
7265," There are still more than 2 billion people who are unvaccinated, and that will accelerate the risk of new variants that may be even more lethal"
7266, Statutory sick pay currently sits at just £96
7267, The 2 million lowpaid workers who earn less than the lower earnings limit of £120 receive nothing
7268,Motions 3 and 4 will be debated together
7269," So what will stop him making serious mistakes like that again when he exercises his new check and oversight powers in, potentially, hundreds more cases Labour wants victims to have the right to make a new personal statement saying how they would feel if the prisoner is released"
7270,5% of reported rape cases ever make it to court
7271," Those that do now take more than 1,000 days, on average, before the trial startsthese are the longest delays in British legal history"
7272," It is striking that, as of last year, only 5% of all Parole Board panel members come from a law enforcement background"
7273, 1 thing in the Ockenden review that came out was that staffing shortfalls can make a difference
7274, A recent CQC survey shows that almost a quarter of women were unable to get help when they needed it during labour
7275," Does he recognise that the Ockenden review has raised fundamental questions for maternity services across the NHS over the culture of socalled normal birth, and that a focus on targets, under successive Governments, rather than on patient outcomes, can distort clinical best practice and, tragically, patient safety Following his discussion with the trusts current chief executive, which he has mentioned, is he satisfied that the current management and clinical teams have accepted the local actions for learning recommendations in the initial Ockenden report, and are committed to studying and rapidly implementing all further recommendations specific to the trust Finally, what reassurance can he give the thousands of expectant mothers in Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin that the maternity services there are safe, and that patient safety is paramount"
7276," It looks at the experiences of almost 1,500 families from 2000 to 2019"
7277," In 12 cases where a mother died, the report concludes that in three quarters of them, the care could have been significantly improved"
7278," That includes providing £95 million for maternity services across England to boost the maternity workforce and to fund programmes for training, development and leadership"
7279," Just a few days ago, the NHS announced a £127 million funding boost for maternity services across England"
7280, I can tell the House that the trust has implemented all the actions set out in the interim report; that was backed at the time by £95 million in extra funding
7281," As I said a moment ago, the final report quite rightly makes many more recommendations, which have all been accepted and which are backed by funding of at least £127 million, much of which will go to workforce"
7282," Lady will have heard me talk about the £95 million given at the time of the interim report, plus the £127 million given for maternity services in the past few days"
7283," Hundreds of thousands of births are delivered through the NHS each year, and the vast majority are completely safe, as I myself have found and as many other Members have found, including my hon"
7284, We have thousands of midwives marching on the streets
7285, The Department has sneaked out the view that restricting contributions to the cap for those being meanstested for their care charges would save an estimated £900 million by 202728 in cash terms
7286," If the calculation towards the cap is to be changed, that change must come the same way, through crossparty working with the sector, patients and people involved, understanding the evidence on impact and considering the consequencesnot through this halfarsed addition to an NHS reorganisation, which is essentially what the Government are doing"
7287," If we are serious about providing governance that rules out the possibility of the private sector influencing the expenditure of public money, an organisation carrying out the functions of an ICB on its behalf should be a statutory NHS body"
7288," Before the pandemic, adult hospices on average received 34% of their funding from Government, with some receiving little or none"
7289," Hospice funding came primarily from charitable donations, with the sector needing to raise £3"
7290,1 million every day
7291, That is a direct transfer of £900 million from household wealth to somewhere else
7292," It also true to say that most people will not be affected, because only people on very long care journeys tend to be affected badly,  but there are quite a few of them according to the Departments own figures, about 6,000 a year10 people per constituencywould be affected in this way, and most of them have dementia"
7293," We know that there are 900,000 people with dementia in the UK today; according to the Alzheimers Society, there will be 1"
7294,"6 million by 2040; and 70% of care home residents are dementia sufferers, and they are the sort of people who will suffer because of the changes"
7295," The research provided by the Alzheimers Society is clear under the Dilnot proposals, about 50% of people living with dementia benefited fully from the care capthey reached the care cap"
7296," Only 13% of people in the least wealthy quintile will reach the cap, whereas 28% of the most wealthy will"
7297, That £900 million has been found from people with less wealth
7298, Look at how different regions are affected only 13% of people in the northeast reach the cap whereas 29% of people in the southeast do so
7299," Previously, in almost every part of the country, about 50% of people did so"
7300," First, it is a really terrible way to come up with policy to change a policy halfway through a Bill, because it starves important policies of public debate and parliamentary scrutiny"
7301," Lords amendments 1, 25, 27 and 49 strengthen our approach to mental health"
7302," As the House knows, this Government are committed to tackling health inequalities, and Lords amendments 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 24, 31, 32, 38, 39 and 41 take us further in tackling disparities and levelling up opportunity and outcomes across the country"
7303," Lords amendments 9, 18, 33 and 40 place duties on NHS trusts, foundation trusts, ICBs and NHS England to have regard to the Governments key ambitions on climate change and the natural environment in everything they do"
7304," Unlike schedule 3 to the Care Act 2014, this duty applies to all carers where the patient has care and support needs following discharge; and it applies to young carers as well as adults"
7305," We want to end unpredictable care costs for everyone by introducing a universal £86,000 cap on an individuals personal care costs"
7306," It would be fairer to keep to the original Dilnot proposals, but can the Minister outline how the £900 million saving that, it is estimated, will result from the Governments proposals and the use of meanstesting will better protect those with lowervalue properties"
7307," I have the witness statements of more than 2,000 people who suffered with mental health problems during the pandemic and who wrote to me detailing what that was like"
7308,"5 million carers supporting a loved one who may be older, disabled or seriously ill"
7309, It is an enormous contribution and saves the health and social care system billions of pounds a year
7310," Friend the Member for South West Surrey Jeremy Hunt, £6"
7311,2 billion was spent on locums in the financial year 201920 to plug the gaps
7312," That means 7,500 more medical schools training places in England over the past six years"
7313," The shadow Health Secretary is obviously right to say that the population has grown in recent decades, but I think it has grown by 8% since 2010, while the number of doctors working in our NHS is up by about one third"
7314,I draw the Ministers attention to the 2 million Uyghurs who have been detained in concentration camps
7315," The Government are rejecting the amendment because they think it would compel them to train more doctors, which is true, but it ignores the fact that this is the best way to reduce the £6"
7316,2 billion locum bill that is currently devastating the NHS budget
7317," Why is there this reluctance to publish the number of doctors we are going to need in 15 years time, given that 97% of hospital bosses say that staff shortages are having an impact on the quality of care they are giving and there are 110,000 vacancies The answer is simple it is because the Government know we are not training enough right now"
7318," This is why it is supported by more than 100 health organisations; every royal college and every health think tank; people in all parts of this House; many peers in the other place, including Lord Stevens, who used to run the NHS; andthis is the point I wish to conclude withby thousands of thousands of doctors and nurses on the frontline"
7319," On Lords amendment 29, does the shadow Minister acknowledge that Macmillan Cancer Support said that it needs an additional 3,371 cancer nurse specialists That would double the nurses by 2030, and it gives us a reason why we need to support Lords amendment 29 and why workforce safety is critical"
7320," I have referred to Macmillan and their request for an additional 3,371 cancer nurse specialists to help address that issue"
7321," Lords amendment 56 clarifies that the powers in part 3 of the Bill in respect of special health authorities apply in relation only to England and crossborder special health authorities, and not Walesonly special health authorities"
7322, The monthly workforce statistics for December 2021 show that there are more than 1
7323,2 million fulltime equivalent staff
7324," In that context, I highlight the decision made, I believe, under one of my predecessors to expand the number of medical school places from 6,000 to 7,500, which has come on stream"
7325," He and I have discussed the significant increase in percentage terms in the number of radiographers, radiologists and others since 2010, but I acknowledge his underlying point that there is more to do if we are to achieve the ambitions set out in our consultation on the 10year cancer plan and our broader ambitions for cancer care and treatment"
7326," Instead, it is in the unenviable position of having to deal with those ongoing challenges at the same time as trying to address the significant backlog that existed before we went into  the pandemic, when a record 4"
7327,5 million people were already on NHS waiting lists
7328, Six million people are now waiting for NHS treatmentthe longest waiting lists on recordand they are waiting longer than ever before
7329," The Health Secretary has admitted that the Government will not meet their manifesto commitment to recruit the 6,000 GPs we need to get people seen on time and we know that many cases will simply present in overstretched accident and emergency departments"
7330," It hopes that ignorance is bliss and that we can carry on as we are, and perhaps nobody will noticeeven the 6 million people on NHS waiting lists"
7331," After the scandal of billions in taxpayers money being handed out to mates for duff PPE and testing contracts, and PPE literally going up in smokealong with taxpayers moneywe hope that this is the start of Ministers looking again at where they went wrong during the pandemic"
7332, The £1
7333,"1 billion given to Wales for test and trace was a Barnett consequential, but we spent only half of that, £533 million, because we used public sector procurement and production effectively"
7334," There are 93,000 NHS staff vacancies; £6 billionplus has been spent on temporary staff to fill gaps; and more than half of staff are working unpaid extra hours each week, with 44% saying that they have felt ill with workrelated issueslittle wonder, given that retention remains a huge issue"
7335, One survey shows that public satisfaction ratings with the NHS are reported to be at a 25year lowa quarter of a century of surveys thereand another shows that the number of NHS staff who would recommend their trust as a place to work has plummeted
7336,"I have another role as Minister for Levelling Up Communities, and the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities recently invested £300 million in a flagship programme to support the families who need help the most"
7337, They are taking tens of thousands of people
7338, Given that 1
7339,"4 million EU citizens who are registered to work in Britain have decided to stay in Europe, should we not be opening our hearts and homes and recognise the benefits some of them would bring by working in the NHS"
7340,1 job
7341," Does that impact assessment then mean we cannot do that because we do not want to lose £20 millionor £20 billion or whatever it happens to bebecause that is too expensive, and that we will on balance therefore purchase from a known slave labour provider Is that what we are saying Is that what the impact assessment will say to us I say to those who call for an impact assessment be careful what you call for"
7342,"Social mobility is a laudable aim that everyone in the House agrees with, but this week I was shocked to see Action for Children report that nearly half of children surveyed from lowincome backgrounds say that they worry about their families finances"
7343," For example, wealthier people who entirely selffund their own residential care are likely to have to spend £86,000 of their own money if they live in a residential home for just over three years"
7344," Somebody who starts with £100,000 of assets would need to draw on care and support in a residential home for about 10 years to have to spend the same amount"
7345," For that reason, we urge the House to reinstate clause 40 and schedule 6"
7346," The National Cyber Security Centre has managed an unprecedented 777 cyber incidents over the last 12 months, up from 723 the previous year, with 40% aimed at the public sector"
7347, We know that Russiansourced cyber attacks rose by 800% in the 48 hours immediately after Putins renewed attack on Ukraine
7348,"According to the National Audit Office investigation into the management of PPE contracts, billions of pounds of taxpayers money is still at risk"
7349," Between March 2020 and October 2021, it cost £737 million to store excess PPE, and costs are currently £7 million per month"
7350," Over half the VIP suppliers provided PPE that the Department of Health and Social Care considers unsuitable for frontline services; in addition, some 1"
7351,5 billion items of PPE are currently in storage and expected to expire before they can be distributed
7352,"The Minister talks about value for money, yet we know that the Government handed hundreds of millions of pounds of our money to an offshore company involving a Tory peer, created just days before and without any transparency, that sold Government PPE at three times the price it had bought it for"
7353," The Government succeeded in getting domestic production, excluding gloves, up from 1% to 70%"
7354," Gentleman refers to 50% of suppliers having something faulty all that means is that in a shipment that may have been of tonnes of PPE, one item was faulty"
7355, It does not mean that 50% of the items received were faulty
7356," There is around £250 billionworth of public procurement and around £50 billionworth of central Government public procurement, and I am extremely keen that SMEs in Northern Ireland are able to get visibility of that pipeline, so that we can tap into the talent and entrepreneurial spirit of which the hon"
7357," All told, I understand the police services of our country have lost several hundred officers killed in the pursuit of their duty since the second world warin other words, not that many"

7362," A typical twobedroom modern flat will be marketed at £750,000"
7363," I should perhaps repeat that for those who think I may have slipped a nought into the wrong place £750,000"
7364," We have at least 93 buildings in Hackney classed as high risk for cladding, but many more with small amounts of cladding need their wretched EWS1 form, and this is proving really difficult"
7365," It was their home that they wanted to live in, and they just cannot sell it because of the EWS1 form and the cladding"
7366," One developer told me recently that, for one development alone, the insurance premium has gone up from £50,000 to £400,000 a year"

7370," At the most waterstressed times of year, the flow of the River Chess is at 41% below natural, and in places the Misbourne does not flow at all"
7371, This is just one example where it has been made clear that HS2 is being constructed with a complete lack of consideration for the environments it is destroying and people it is impacting
7372, It seems that HS2 Ltd and its contractors are doing neither
7373," Just before Christmas, HS2 Ltd presented some of my constituents with the gift of a notice of entry declaring that it would be entering their homes to install movement monitoring apparatus"
7374, I am sure Members can imagine how distressing it was when my constituents were then unable to contact HS2 Ltd for weeks to understand what that meant in practice
7375," HS2 Ltd is failing to communicate transparently, exacerbating the already strained relationship with communities, who feel they are having this project imposed on them"
7376," HS2 Ltd is treating its interactions with people and the environment like a tickbox exercise, doing no more than meeting minimum requirements"
7377," The debates cannot be the same without him, but as you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, we have urged on behalf of the Committee that the summer recess Adjournment debate be titled the Sir David Amess Adjournment debate"
7378," Member for Gateshead Ian Mearns, was taken unwell this morning, so on behalf of the Committee I would like to say to the hon"
7379," That is good newsin 1971, it was 50%but we still have a long way to go to get to a smokefree England"
7380," That proposal is supported by the vast majority of the adult population in this country, including more than 50% of 18 to 24yearolds themselves"
7381, Implementing such a levy on the profits of the big tobacco companies would raise £700 million
7382," The Governments resettlement scheme for Afghans has placed more than 6,000 people and continues to be supportive, but he was right to make that point"
7383," Once again, that is worth flagging in the Houseit is something the Government take seriously, which is why we have invested more than £30 million in our safer streets and safety of women at night funds to help women and girls to feel safer"
7384, The Government have made £520 million available to improve access to general  practice
7385, Tens of thousands of people throughout the country have made a very generous offer and they want to be able to extend that and for it to be taken up
7386, I recognise the challenge that HS2 must be bringing to that part of the world with the construction that is taking place in her patch
7387, Hopefully that pain will soon be over and we will be able to ride on HS2 once it has finished its construction process

7392," Through the sheer determination of the residents and their families, they kept that care home open, and not just thatthey secured the £1million investment that they needed to upgrade it"

7419," We now have PAS 9980, which will not replace EWS1, but could the Minister say that from his perspective he would rather people look at PAS 9980, as opposed to EWS1"
7420,"I must draw the Houses attention to the fact that financial privilege is engaged by Lords amendments 6, 17, 22 to 30, 103, 104, 111 to 113, 116, 120 to 127, 137 and 138"
7421, Lords amendment 1 addresses a concern with clause 10
7422, Lords amendments 2 to 4 and 48 are minor and technical in nature
7423," The salary of an immigration tribunal judgea firsttier tribunal judgeis £117,000"
7424," If we put on oncosts, even most generously we get £200,000"
7425," So far, £120 million has been committed to the Rwanda scheme; around 600 firsttier tribunal judges could be bought for that, or any number of hundreds of Home Office caseworkers"
7426," Right now, the average percentage of victims who engage with investigations is not 89%, but 33%"
7427, Lords amendment 9 exempts from the prohibition on relocation those relocation subsidies that have the effect of reducing social or economic disadvantage
7428,"I would like to use my three minutes, which have not come up on the clock yet, to focus on Lords amendment 6B"
7429," The Bill would further expand the number of people without access to public funds such as welfare benefits and housing assistance, and thereby ensure that thousands more refugees a year fleeing war and persecution are at increased risk of falling into destitution and homelessness once they have reached the UK"
7430, I urge all Members to support Lords amendment 6B to ensure that refugees living in the UK are not forced into poverty and destitution
7431, An estimated 80 million people are displaced by conflicts and instability around the world
7432," For nearly 20 years, it has been possible under UK law to remove individuals from the UK while their asylum claim is pending if a certificate is issued under schedule 3 of the Asylum and Immigration Treatment of Claimants, etc Act 2004"

7434,"5 billion, it is the highest in more than two decades"
7435," Every day, the cost of the broken system on hotels alone is nearly £5 million"
7436, I shall be quick and focus on Lords amendment 7
7437, Friend accept that Lords amendments 7B  and 7C have been qualified to make the proper concession that people seeking asylum should not be given preferential treatment to those who already have refugee status and that there is a builtin review period I and others have said on many occasions that there is simply no evidence to suggest that a limited right to work is a pull factor
7438," It will not tackle the 12,000long queue of Afghan refugees loyal to Britain who are currently languishing in hotels, alongside a further 25,000 asylum seekers, at an eyewatering cost to the British taxpayer of £4"
7439,7 million daily
7440," It is caused by this Home Secretary, on whose watch we have seen a staggering 60% drop in processed claims"
7441," Contrasting that with the £11,000 that it costs to process an asylum seeker here in the UK, we start to see the impact on the public purse"
7442, Then there is the £120 million in development aid
7443," There can be absolutely no doubt that the Governments claim that Rwanda is a safe country for refugees will be challenged in the courts given that thousands of Rwandans seek asylum in Europe every year, with 76 Rwandan citizens granted asylum here in the UK since 2017"
7444," Labour Members have continually made the case that the Bill must meet Britains obligations under the 1951 UN refugee convention, and we are supporting Lords amendment 5B, which secures this"
7445," First, we support  Lords amendment 6B, which seeks to ensure that all refugees are given their convention rights and that family unity is maintained, even if the Government are determined to introduce the utterly inappropriate differential treatment aspect of this Bill, which, shamefully, contravenes the UN convention"
7446," For example, only 13% of land in the UK is owned by womenin other words, 87% is owned by menand boys are twice as likely as girls to inherit family businesses"
7447, Friend always raises pertinent issues on behalf of his constituents in Winchester
7448," If a leaseholder property is valued at less than £175,000, or £325,000 in London, the leaseholder will pay nothing and, if the leaseholder has already met interim costs that exceed the contributions cap, they will pay nothing"
7449," The Government originally proposed that leaseholders contributions be capped at £10,000, or £15,000 in Greater London, and we believe that creates a fair balance"
7450," We are therefore restoring the caps at £10,000 outside London and £15,000 in London, as originally proposed, and have made a small number of other technical improvements to those measures"
7451,"As I understand it, the difficulty is that a claim would need to be made on behalf of leaseholders by their landlord, who would insist on indemnity funding"
7452," However, we recognise that any subsidy regime must provide sufficient transparency and accountability for the spending of billions of pounds of public money each year"
7453," As of today, DP World is still a partner in the London Gateway freeport and is potentially set to benefit from £25 millionworth of public funding"
7454,5 million threshold for subsidies to services of public economic interest were far too high
7455," Lords amendments 26 to 30 and 32 lower the threshold for publishing subsidies to services of public economic interest to £100,000"
7456," In Committee, Labour tabled new clause 3, which would have given the CMA the power to investigate subsidies that may be of concern and subsidy schemes on its own initiative"
7457," I am therefore pleased that the Lords tabled Lords amendment 9, which removes the relocation prohibition on subsidies that work to reduce social and economic disadvantages"
7458," It reduces the threshold for subsidies to be included in the transparency database from £500,000 to £100,000"
7459," The threshold of £500,000 was too high for us to have a good enough overview, and that is without mentioning peoples inability to challenge subsidies if they do not know they exist"
7460," Setting the threshold at £100,000 makes it much less likely that a company will be badly damaged by a harmful subsidy that it is unable to challenge because of the lack of transparency"
7461," Schedule 2 contains a lot of commonsense principles already, which support the UKs priorities on net zero and protecting the environment"
7462, I am massively concerned that net zero is included only in schedule 2 and not in schedule 1
7463," If the Government are not prepared to come to any kind of compromise with the House of Lords, would it not be even better for all these powers to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament, so that the people of Scotland could build the kind of humane immigration and asylum system that hundreds of constituents in Glasgow North have lobbied me to advocate for in this House"
7464," She needs to hire more caseworkers and invest in the court system, so that we can process applications quickly and dramatically reduce the ludicrous £4"

7467,"Motion made, and Question put, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 8B"
7468," Since then, thousands of leaseholders have been forced to live with the anxiety of being in unsafe buildings through no fault of their own"
7469," On the point about the building cost thresholds, he will know that the London median house price is £515,000, but in Runnymede and Weybridge it is £475,000"
7470," There is a general welcome for the Governments attempts to take a more proportionate approach and for moving away, albeit over a period of time, from EWS1 forms to PAS 9980, which can cover whole blocks rather than individual properties"
7471," The two questions that the Select Committee has not had answers  to are, first, whether the Government will look at making the building regulator responsible for deciding which blocks need this new assessment rather than the building owners, who might have a particular interest in saying no; and, secondly, whether he will ensure that the professional indemnity insurance scheme also applies to assessors on the PAS 9980 assessments as well as to those on the EWS1 forms"
7472," That was going to solve everything, but obviously it was not, even when the Chancellor stood up and offered in his Budget the £1 billion building safety fund and said that was going to give everything the Select Committee had asked for, which it was not and did not"
7473, The National Housing Federation has said that up to £10 billion could be needed to remediate social housing
7474," The G15 group of social housing landlords has said that, for their properties alone, it could be over £3 billion"
7475," Friend raised about what happens if leaseholders have already paid up to the £10,000 cap but there are further costs"
7476," What happens in those circumstances It would be scandalous if leaseholders who have already paid the £10,000, or £15,000 in London, were to suffer that for want of someone to pay the bill"
7477," As has been said, many of those people have been presented with eyewatering bills, such as £250,000 or more, to fix fire safety issues that are definitely not their fault, are clearly the responsibility of the developer in the first place and should have been put right since"
7478," It cannot be fair, or in keeping with natural justice, that in some cases the single determinant of whether someone has to pay £10,000 or £15,000and someone else does notis the arbitrary fact of whether the Government can find another party to carry the can"
7479," The valuation of properties could leave one flat liable for £10,000 or even £15,000, while an identical flat in the same block could be exempt"
7480," Of course, I was not nearly as cynical as the leaseholders who were facing bills for tens of thousands of pounds and were wondering whether the issue would just be kicked down the road and into the long grass"
7481," Member for Sheffield South East Mr Betts, who said that if a building were 1 cm lower than it needed to be, that could be the most expensive centimetre in history"
7482, Leaseholders in buildings above 18 metres are already protected by the Governments £5
7483,1 billion building safety fund for the removal of unsafe cladding
7484," Assessments carried out in accordance with the new PAS 9980 principles should produce more proportionate responses than costly and, ultimately, unnecessary remediation"
7485, The Government have been clear in their view that an EWS1 form should not be required for buildings below 18 metres in height
7486," Given the small number of buildings involved, a blanket legislative intervention bringing hundreds of thousands more buildings into scope to deal with an issue affecting just a handful of buildings would be entirely disproportionate"
7487, Enfranchised buildings are eligible for the £5
7488,1 billion building safety fund in the same way as other buildings
7489," Gentleman is right that it would not be appropriate for me to speak on behalf of the Welsh Government, and I do not think they would like that either"
7490, Social housing providers will not be subject to provisions that stipulate that building owners and landlords with a net worth of more than £2 million per inscope building must pay all inscope remediation costs
7491," Friend the Member for Worthing West Sir Peter Bottomley, let me say that we are retrospectively extending the limitation period under section 1 of the Defective Premises Act"
7492," Mandale House, in my constituency, faces a range of problems, and has secured £3"
7493,4 million from the building safety fund towards the necessary remediation
7494," However, that falls short of what is needed, and Mandale House is left with £7"
7495,4 million to find in order to complete the work
7496," Six years later, those responsible were fined more than £300,000 because their fire protection work had been clearly inadequate"
7497," I am not talking about people who live in big, expensive, multimillionpound apartments looking out over the Thames"
7498,"May I suggest that it would be a good idea if the Government had a roundtable with the insurers about what informal provision they are making in case there are successful actions, and about whether they would like voluntarily to contribute, say, £4 billion to £5 billion No residential leaseholder would then carry the cost, and the insurance company would know that it would not be chased with legal claims that were likely to succeed"
7499," Leaseholders can still have to pay up to £15,000 if funds cannot be recovered from the developer or freeholder, and leaseholders in buildings under 11 metres are entirely excluded"
7500, Large sections of the Bill have been completely rewritten on the basis of hundreds of Government amendments tabled in the other place that the noble Lords had relatively little time to consider carefully or properly scrutinise
7501," Lords amendment 6 specified fourfire suppression systems, the safety of stairways and ramps, the certification of electrical equipment, and provision for people with disabilitiesand we supported it"
7502," Having maintained in the other place that the amendment was entirely unnecessary, the Government yesterday tabled an amendment in lieu of Lords amendment 6 that almost entirely mirrors its provisions"
7503, 1508
7504, 1509
7505," Four and a half years after Grenfell, the Bill needs to be amended to reflect and deal with this issue"
7506," As it stands, buildings held in trust on behalf of a thirdparty investor,  where the landlord is a professional depository or custodian regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, or buildings owned on trust by what I can only describe as ground rent grazersalmost invariably based offshoredo not meet any of the association tests or the net wealth test in the Bill"
7507," Unless the Bill is revised to capture such trustee arrangements, they will escape the socalled waterfall system as set out in schedule 8, and the leaseholders will find themselves picking up a proportion of the costs of noncladding remediation"
7508," Although we fully acknowledge that the waterfall system now set out in schedule 8 provides leaseholders with a far greater degree of protection than the Bill as originally drafted proposed, it does not protect them fully"
7509,2 billion
7510, I want to represent the leaseholders in Monument Court in my constituency who at the momentI will speak to the Minister about thisare being sent bills by Higgins Homes for 50% of costs
7511," They are already getting £10 million from the building safety fund, and they need to find £5 million from leaseholders"
7512," In my constituency, leaseholders who are affected would not pay a single penny, because the Secretary of State gave a commitment from the Dispatch Box in a previous debate that waking watch costs that had already been paid over the past five yearsextended to 10 years, which we are very pleased about and did not even ask forwould contribute towards the £10,000"
7513," Up and down the country millions of leaseholders have won, but we must turn that victory into reality"
7514," As we know, at the moment millions of them are trapped"
7515," Because we know that the most that any leaseholder will ever paytechnically, in theoryis £10,000, we have created value again in every single one of those properties"
7516," We have got the market moving again, because everybody knows that they will not have to face what in the case of Vista Tower is a remediation bill of £180,000 or £200,000 on a £180,000 flat"
7517," Indeed, a recent survey by End our Cladding Scandal of more than 2,200 properties and buildings over 11 metres tall shows that more than 64% of leaseholders outside London and more than 83% of leaseholders in London will not be protected from the costs of noncladding fire safety defects"
7518," Leaseholders in buildings that are under 11 metres remain unprotected, and there is still no funding commitment from house builders for the £4 billion required for the remediation of buildings where the developer no longer exists"
7519,"I beg to move, That this House agrees with Lords amendment 1"
7520," First, in place of the higher transparency thresholds that applied to subsidies given under a published scheme, and given as minimal financial assistance or services of public economic interest assistance, we have introduced a single upload threshold of £100,000, which now applies to all subsidies that are subject to the transparency requirements"
7521," This represents a substantial 80% reduction from the original threshold of £500,000 for subsidies given under the schemes"
7522," On insurance, which has been my bugbear as well, it is not just that many of the insurance companies insured the development beforehand, and therefore provided a warranty of sorts, but that since then they have increased premiums on leaseholders, sometimes by more than 1,000%"
7523," There is an important distinction between companies or businesses with which the Government may be working to achieve policy objectives, and their eligibility still to receive public subsidies, potentially to the tune of hundreds of thousands of pounds or millions, where they have explicitly even admitted to this House that they have broken employment law"
7524,"With less than 2% of the Conservative parliamentary party in the Chamber, it must be beyond debate that the Prime Minister will be investigated by the Privileges Committee"
7525," More seriously, it is also coming at a cost to the publics faith in political leadership, such as it is, except, I am pleased to say, in Scotland, where Scottish Tory votersincluding in my Angus constituencyneeded to take only one look at this Prime Minister for Tory seats in Scotland to fall by 55% at the 2019 election"
7526, He is a disgrace to the office of Prime Minister and an insult to the millions of the electorate who played by the book
7527," Is it not important that we have this inquiry now to understand whether that has happened and there has been a repeated offence against the House   In the past year, half of the public have lost what little trust they had in politicians"
7528," On the point about repeated offences and forgiveness, I would encourage her to look at Romans 7"
7529," 10 and showing complete contempt for his own rules, workingclass communities and young people in overcrowded flats all over Britain were in lockdown The mental health crisis that we still have around us was intensified by the very strict operation of those rules, and many young people faced massive £10,000 fines for organising parties"
7530," For context, in the same period the parties took place we were held to a strict oneparent bedside rule, and were only allowed to swap every 5 nights"
7531, The Prime Minister has to accept that this is not just a Westminster row that nobody outside SW1 is concerned about
7532," No fewer than 190,000 people have died from covid, and more than 1 million people have long covid"

7536," It is heartwarming to note, particularly following the publication of the Truro review slightly more than two and a half years ago, how increasingly Government are engaging on this issue, and not just expressing concern, but taking practical steps"
7537," We have committed £3 million over five years to the UNESCO global media defence fund, which has supported more than 1,700 journalists, including many of those who have received threats online"
7538, We also support media freedom through our development aid budget and have spent more than £400 million on that over the past five years
7539," Our most recent figures show that, in just one year, the programme benefited 2"
7540,"3 million people in almost 300 communities in Indonesia, Brazil, Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa"
7541," They were not pleasant, and we choose to forget them to a degree, dont we However, it is important that we do not forget what that meant, not just for the elderly couple I spoke to on Sunday, but for many othersfor hundreds of people that we know"
7542," We all remember how, at 5 pm every day, he stood before us to recite the rules and plead that we should follow them, but when he walked  back through those wooden doors, he was partying"
7543," For every one who has written to me, thousands are discussing it with their families, friends and neighbours"
7544," I have hundreds of emails from constituents; I wanted to read some out, but there is not time"
7545," Many people have written to me asking why he has only been given a  50 quid fine while others are being fined up to £10,000 for breaches of the rules"
7546," From that same poll, conducted by Compassion in Politics, we learnt that 47% of people have lost trust in UK politicians during the past 12 months"
7547," Perhaps I have given too many examples for anyone to absorb unless they are already engaged in this subject, so I shall give just one example of how such misuse of technology works in practicenamely, the misuse of technology to oppress the Uyghurs in China, of whom an estimated 2 million, possibly even up to 3 million, are incarcerated in detention camps"
7548," Even when he was challenged with photographic evidence of him partying away while millions were stuck at home, he absurdly pleaded his innocence"
7549,"The motion refers to the Prime Ministers comments in this place on 1 and 8 December 2021, but these are simply specimens"
7550," We know that MPsmost of uswork incredibly hard on behalf of our constituents, but the reality is that the actions of the lawbreaking Prime Minister further push the false narrative that all politicians are the same"
7551," When Members assume good faith on behalf of our opponents, we can explore, test and interrogate our reasonable disagreements about how we achieve our common goals"
7552," Our constituents are genuinely upset and sincerely believe that the Prime Minister has liedin fact, YouGov has just published an opinion poll that shows that 78% of the public think he has"
7553," I spend a lot of my time trying to talk to the public about that element of politics, and to explain why 99% of people in this building came here"
7554," I am afraid to say, however, that it is the very rare 1% who we are discussing today, because I do not believe that that is true of the Prime Minister"
7555," The debate may continue for as long as it takes unless either there is a successful closure motion to bring the debate to an end or we reach 5 oclock, in which case the debate will be adjourned to a future day"
7556, 4849
7557," We are denying Russia mostfavourednation treatment relating to hundreds of key products, ramping up the pressure on Russias economy by making it more difficult for it to trade by imposing punitive tariffs of 35%"
7558," I am a proud Scot, and the Scots and the Russians spent most of their time in each others courtsthere were admirals, there were generals and there were physicians, and 150 years of ScottishRussian links helped to build the Russian medical system that we know today"
7559," 1 point is that it has been shown that a consequence of this aggression is the expansion of NATO, not a contraction, and plenty of other countries are watching"
7560," To help everybody, I am expecting the statement to end round about 6"
7561, That is why Nord Stream 2 is important
7562," 2 Bill returns to this House, will the Government bring forward measures to tighten up on the flow of dirty Russian money in the UKor is the truth really that he is perfectly content with that because so much of it appears to end up in Tory party coffers"
7563, 1 issue of concern
7564," Some 13,000 Ukrainian lives have been lost in fighting since then"
7565," Since 2015, the UK has helped to build the resilience and capabilities of the Ukrainian armed forces through Operation Orbital, which has trained more than 22,000 Ukrainian troops"
7566," We should not forget the thousands of Ukrainians who have lost their lives defending their  country and who, every day, are murdered by snipers from across the divide"
7567," We wish to be friends with the Russian people, as we have been for hundreds of years"
7568," On his point about ethnic nationalism, it is something that in the UK is against our DNA, because of the lessons we have seen over hundreds of years"
7569," We remain clear that Russias actions in recent weeks and months, with the massing of 100,000 combatready troops, tanks and heavy military equipment near Ukraines eastern border, is unacceptable"
7570," In those 17 pages, NATO appears in one paragraph"
7571," We enhance and work our relationship with Finland and Sweden through the joint expeditionary force, which is 11 nationsScandinavian and Nordic, and Britainworking together and exercising together in the defence world"
7572," Among other things, Germany has made it plain that Nord Stream 2 cannot go aheadGermany cannot take part in itif there is a Russian invasion of Ukraine"
7573," Everybodyparticularly the Americans; he heard what I said about the 8,500 troops getting ready to go to Europecan see the need now to move NATO forces, to fortify NATOs eastern flank"
7574,"Short, concise questions please, because I will be finishing this statement at 20 past 2"
7575," Can that be confirmed as on the table today The measures must also include tougher action on Russian money laundering and include action by the Treasury to tackle the ongoing and improper use of Scottish limited partnerships, which have been used to funnel millions of pounds in dirty money"
7576," Do not forget, it is quite right to say that 41% of Russias GDP comes from oil and gas"
7577,Is this the wakeup call that NATO needs so that all its members finally meet their obligations to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defence
7578,"I remind the House that we do actually guarantee the sovereignty of Ukraine, having signed the Budapest memorandum in 1994, along with the United States and Russia, and I think later France, and even China"
7579," In 2014, the seizure of Crimea was discussed in the Security Council on seven occasions, I think"
7580," Is the Prime Minister not concerned, given the answer he just gave about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and the fact that discussions are still continuing about exclusion from the SWIFT system, that we are not demonstrating determined, united resolve at the very moment when we need the credible threat of strong sanctions to try and deter President Putin from invading Ukraine"
7581," That was the fantastic achievement of the end of the cold war, the fall of the Berlin wall, and that high moment in 1990 when we had a Europe whole and free"
7582,7 of that treaty
7583,"The Prime Minister will know that Ukraine is not a full member of NATO, but may I ask him to comment on the feasibility of direct military action by NATO, notwithstanding that article 5 does not apply"
7584," We have sent 2,000 antitank weapons to  the Ukrainians and we join the Americans in that effort; as my right hon"
7585," Friend knows, the Americans have sent about $650 millionworth of military assistance to Ukraine"
7586," I am sure he has read the 5,000word essay by Vladimir Putin about Ukraine and the origins of Russia"
7587, We already have a very wide package of sanctions in place since the Russian incursion of 2014
7588, I am afraid he is not right in what he says about abandoning Ukraine since 2014
7589," With Operation Orbital, the UK has been out there in the front, helping to train 21,000 Ukrainian troops since 2015"
7590, I have been saying for a very long time that the arguments that President Putin uses about Russian speakers in Ukraine are exactly the same as Adolf Hitler advanced over the Sudeten Germans in Czechoslovakia in the 1930s
7591, I am sure there will be other sanctions comingI do not quite understand why we have sanctioned only 25% of the people the  American Government have already sanctioned
7592,President Putin has not even waited for the gas to start flowing through the Nord Stream 2 pipeline before exploiting the stranglehold that he has been building on the German economy
7593,A percentage of our natural gas comes from Russia and Putin has already said that he will turn off the taps if he deems Moscow to be unfairly sanctioned by the west
7594," Could I ask him to take further action on energy, as I did during the Russian invasion of Crimea Alongside all the measures he rightly proposed in his statement, will he convene a summit of the G7 Energy Ministers, as we had back in 2014, to look at how we can improve shortterm and mediumterm energy security, protect consumers in this country and elsewhere against rocketing gas prices and give ourselves a much stronger hand in the face of Putins aggression"
7595," We have to be respectful of this, but the simple fact is that about 3% the UKs gas supplies come from Russia, whereas about 36% of German energy needs come from Russian gas"
7596," As I told the House just now, only 3% of our gas supplies come from Russia, but he is right about the spike in prices, which is why we are working together with President Biden and other colleagues to see what we can do to increase the supply of gas both to Europe and of course to this country"
7597," Actually, Russian gas comprises only 3% of the UKs gas supplies, but we have to mitigate the impact of the  cost of energy on families with the cold weather payments and everything that we are doing to increase the living wageall the support that we are giving families throughout the winter and beyond"
7598," But I reassure the House and the country that I and the whole Government are focused 100% on dealing with the peoples priorities, including the UKs leading role in protecting freedom around the world"
7599," Russia has, of course, already attacked Ukraine, illegally annexing 10,000 square miles of her territory in 2014 and igniting a war in the Donbass region"
7600," Last week, the UK acted to strengthen Ukraines ability to defend her soil by supplying antiarmour missiles and deploying a small training team of British personnel, in addition to the work of Operation Orbital, which, as the House will know, has trained 21,000 Ukrainian troops since 2015"
7601," Denmark is sending a frigate to the Baltic and deploying four F16s to Lithuania to join NATOs longstanding air policing mission; France has expressed its readiness to send troops to Romania under NATO command; and the United States has raised the alert level of 8,500 combat troops, preparing to deploy them in Europe at short notice"
7602," We cannot bargain away the vision of a Europe whole and free that emerged in those amazing years from 1989 to 1991, healing the division of our continent by the iron curtain"
7603," More than half of Europe, including a dozen or more members of NATO and of the European Union, would be only partially sovereign and required to seek the Kremlins approval before inviting any military personnel from NATO countries on to their soil"
7604," The Czech Republicat the very heart of Europe, hundreds of miles from Russiawould have to ask the Kremlin for permission if she wanted to invite a company of German infantry to join an exercise or even to help with flood defences"
7605," It is therefore important that we demonstrate that although Ukraine is not in NATO, we can do our best to protect its right to choose; and it is also important that we make it crystal clear to the President of Russia that if he tries this with NATO partners, no matter how big or small, article 5 is a reality"
7606,The President of the United States made it very clear that he will stop Nord Stream 2
7607," Friend specifically about sanctions Will the UK, when it presents its package, ensure that its sanctions are synchronised with those of the United States, that they include action to prevent UK banks from handling foreign currency transfers from Russian stateowned banks, and that they also include what I know our colleagues in the United States Senate would like to includespecific sanctions against Nord Stream 2"
7608," Yemen gets about 20% of its food from Ukrainian grain; for Libya, the figure is 44%"
7609," Will he comment on a specific loophole relating to where Russia gets its money from Under the International Monetary Funds special drawing rights, $650 billion was allocated to states around the world last year, and Russia got $17"
7610,5 billion
7611," That is done by our forces, and it is why we have made even more available, including 1,000 members of the Army currently on standby in the UK to send elsewhere"
7612," The purpose of that extra £24 billion was to modernise our armed forces, and also to ensure that we are able to enter new domains where we are threatened by both Russia and other adversaries"
7613," We also fully support moves to reinforce the security of NATO allies, as the Labour leader and I told the Secretary General at NATO headquarters earlier this month"
7614,"What will the Government do to try to impress on President Putin that even if he invades the rest of Ukraine without military comeback on behalf of Ukraine, it would be a fatal error for him to think that he could then invade an outlying NATO stateone of the Baltic states, for examplewithout an attack on one rightly being considered to be an attack on all NATO members"
7615," Although I accept that NATOs potential for direct intervention is limited due to article 5, what planning is there for a possible crossborder refugee and humanitarian catastrophe"
7616," Does he want to apologise for that remark, which was not only crass, but undermined efforts to deliver Minsk II as the starting point for our best chance of avoiding war Does he accept that if the Government are serious about playing a constructive role, they should start by getting their own house in orderfirst of all by repaying the almost £2 million that his party has received in Russian donations since the Prime Minister took office Will he finally end Londons role in hiding the proceeds of Kremlinconnected corruption"
7617," However, Russian aggression against Ukraine threatens the strategic supply of food around the world, because Ukraine is the third biggest exporter of grain, at 100 million tonnes a year, so what assessment has he made of the areas of the world that are most likely to be affected if aggression should lead to that food not being available Does he not agree that that underlines the strategic importance of Ukraine and the importance of giving it every bit of support to allow it to defend its independence, democracy and vital economic role"
7618," If 1 million refugees appear in Hungary, Romania or Poland, I would urge the EU to step up and think about what it is going to do about millions of refugees on its soil rather than think about it afterwards"
7619," Gentlemans behalf, to engage with the National Crime Agency to see what more we can do"
7620, The British Government are continually exhorting our European friends to exceed the 2% threshold
7621," It would be a great thing if we could get some of them up to 2%, never mind 3%"
7622," I think there are about 1,100 currently still in Ukraine, and there is a helpline that people should ring"
7623, It is 01908 516666
7624," I am expecting to run this statement until around 2 oclock, so short questions and pithy answers would certainly be helpful"
7625, Friend accept that too many NATO Governments and political parties have accepted energy  dependence on Putin and financial dependence on dodgy donations from Russian oligarchs Given that we spent between 4
7626,"5% and 5% of GDP on defence throughout the 1980s until the end of the cold war, will he now accept 3% of GDP on defence as a suitable future benchmark"
7627," We must shore up that country, and that is why I announced a further $500 million of support today from the UK Government"
7628, I echo his welcoming of Chancellor Scholzs brave decision today to freeze Nord Stream 2
7629," Given the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the fact that we have now entered a new era in the battle for democracy globally, will he now consider a substantial and sustained increase in defence spending, well above the 2"
7630,"4% that is required to ensure stability and peace in our time Jawjaw, if indeed there is room for it in future, will be more effective with stronger armed forces"
7631," If the worst happens, a European nation of 44 million men, women and children would become the target of a fullscale war of aggression waged, without a shred of justification, for the absurd and even mystical reasons that Putin described last night"
7632, We will now guarantee up to $500 million of Development Bank financing
7633," Gentlemans point about visas, we are stopping tier 1 visas from Russia"
7634," We have put another 1,000 troops on standby, and this country will continue to do what it has always done and receive those who are fleeing in fear of persecution"
7635, We should work with our European allies to ensure that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is cancelled
7636," Friend go back to the EU and NATO, in particular, and say that we have to raise our spending budgets to at least 3% to have more planes, more ships and more men to deter Russia and not to wage war, but to prevent one from happening"
7637,"Ukraine has been experiencing conflict since 2014, which has created a crisis of 2"
7638,9 million people in need
7639," Promsvyazbank is a top 10 Russian bank, which services 70% of state contracts signed by the Russian Ministry of Defence, but the measures we have prepared are much tougher still, and we will have absolutely no hesitation in implementing them"
7640," There is a G7 meeting straight after this statement, and we will be holding meetings in NATO, in the P5 and in every forum where it is relevant and possible to bring President Putin to understand the gravity of what he is doing"
7641, I also welcome the decision by Chancellor Scholz to suspend Nord Stream 2
7642," In the UK, we are in the fortunate position of having only 3% of our gas coming from Russia, but other European countries have learned that they have much more to do"
7643," By the way, I salute the decision of the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to cancel Nord Stream 2"
7644," Friends point about defence spending, actually we are up at 2"
7645,4% of GDPI think that is one of the highest figures in NATOand we are the second biggest contributor and military power in NATO already
7646,"We have seen a 10% increase in defence spending in this country, and we will sustain that increase in defence spending"
7647," As he knows, in Poland we have increased our support with another 350 Royal Marines from 45 Commando, and in Estonia we have doubled our presence in Tapa to 2,000"
7648," He asked about support for Ukraine; as I mentioned in the House, we have given £100 millionworth of support particularly for Ukraines energy crisis and also for other economic needs, plus the further $500 million I announced just now"
7649," We must understand that and be prepared for it, which is why we are investing massively in cyberpreparedness, with another £2"
7650,6 billion to help fortify our defences
7651,"According to expert legal advice I have seen, there are serious flaws in the new sanctions regime it may not affect oligarchs close to Putin who do not hold an official position in a company or who own less than 50% of shares; it is too narrow in defining the individuals it covers; unlike US legislation, it is limited in how we can sanction Russian Government officials; and the definition of Government of Russia excludes the legislative branch, including the Duma"
7652," Can the Minister give us an update on the membership action plan, the prelude to NATO membership When Poland joined in 1999, we were told it was a step too far; when Romania joined NATO in 2004, we were told it was a step too far"
7653,"We stand firm in our support for Ukraines NATO membership aspirations, in line with the 2008 Bucharest summit declaration, in which NATO allies agreed that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance"
7654," Will the Minister set out very clearly that the article 5 protection of our NATO allies in the Baltic states stands firm and will be unquestionable, and that Britain will not renege on our enhanced forward presence, which is protecting the Baltic states from any Russian aggression"
7655, The UK position on Nord Stream 2 has not changed
7656," We have repeatedly aired our concerns about the construction of Nord Stream 2, which would undermine European security by allowing Russia to tighten its grip on those nations that rely on its gas"
7657," Nord Stream 2 would divert supplies away from Ukraine, and the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine is regarded as a deterrent against further Russian aggression, so it is a vital part of Ukraines national security"
7658," We cracked down on illicit finance through the groundbreaking legislation introduced in 2017, the Criminal Finances Act, and we published our economic crime plan in 2019"
7659," We remain willing to engage in consultations, as provided for under that memorandum, as we did back in March 2014 in Paris after Russias illegal annexation of Crimea"
7660," When Iran was excluded from the SWIFT system in 2012, it required an EU regulation to make SWIFT do that, because SWIFT is incorporated under Belgian law"
7661,"We have continually voiced our concerns about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and we will continue to do so"
7662, We have heard alreadywe have not had an answerthat the SWIFT payment system and Nord Stream 2 must be on the table
7663," Friend support a strengthening of our £23 million counterdisinformation and development aid package to Ukraine, which can help Ukrainians to discern fact from Russian fiction on social media"
7664," Gentleman for the wisdom and the statesmanship with which he has just spoken On his points, we have put 1,000 troops on standby to help with the humanitarian exodus in the adjacent countries, and we have people in forward presence in the adjacent countries to help UK nationals come out"
7665," Gentleman is absolutely right to raise that appalling possibility, and it is vital that we reaffirm, again, that under article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty, we stand foursquare behind every one of our NATO allies and will come to their defence"

7674," Our undersea cables carry more than 95% of western military, diplomatic, commercial, financial and personal communications, and the consequences of these cables being weaponised is terrifying"
7675,"Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland triggered article 4 of the north Atlantic treaty today, and I heard that we will be joining those discussions"
7676, That is why on Tuesday I announced the $500 million extra package of development aid on top of the £100 million that we have already given
7677," Today, thousands of Russians are protesting in citiesagainst their domestic lawabout this awful war"
7678," May I ask him to look wider than simply the Russian people, and at all those who are enabling Putins economythose who sit on boards of the businesses that finance him, whether they are former Chancellors of Germany, or former Prime Ministers of France Will he look here, close to home, at those who enable and propagate the propaganda that is used by Putin to undermine his own people and free people everywhere Will he update the Treason Act 1351, so that we can identify those people and call them what they are traitors When the Prime Minister speaks to people around the world, will he   speak with the truth that he can in Russian through the BBC Russian service, and start to broadcast in languages other than Russian into Russia, so that all Russian peoples can know that their oppression does not need to exist and they do not need to side with the tyrant"
7679,"As well as being incredibly ruthless, President Putin is incredibly rich, with one assessment saying that his personal wealth is up to $200 billion"
7680," The world must isolate Russia like the rogue state it is, including the statebacked oil giant Rosneft, which is 20% owned by BP"

7686," So what steps are the Government taking to prepare for the humanitarian issue Will the 1,000 troops on standby to help with humanitarian assistance now be deployed"
7687,"I would like to state, on behalf of the people of Norwich, our solidarity with the people of Ukraine"

7690," Does Britain support NATOs response force now being activated in full What further contribution will the UK make to reinforcing NATO allies on the eastern flank, and when will the 1,000 UK troops on standby to help with humanitarian assistance be deployed The Minister also mentioned the doubling up of British forces in Estonia"
7691, The Antonov2 airfield north of Kyiv was taken by Russian airborne forces as part of the initial assault yesterday morning but was reportedly retaken by the Ukrainian forces overnight
7692, They report that 137 Ukrainian service personnel have been killed in action as well as 57 civilians; hundreds more have been injured
7693," Those doubledup force levels will  remain indefinitely and will be augmented by the headquarters of 12 Mechanised Brigade, meaning that the United Kingdom will have an armoured brigade in Estonia, reassuring one of our closest NATO allies"
7694," We need to have our eyes wide open to the reality that in such an event NATO jets would, not just possibly but most certainly probably, come into a combat situation with Russian jets, and the risk of miscalculation, escalation and the triggering of article 5 could not be understated in those circumstances"
7695," As Members will appreciate, in the air domain the risk of miscalculation is greater, because things are happening at Mach 2 and there is no time for political calibration; it is in the hands of pilots who are flying at well over the speed of sound"
7696," I understand exactly why the Ukrainian ambassador is asking for this, but we need to be clear that it could well trigger an article 5 moment and we need to be cleareyed about that reality in considering it"
7697," The 1,000 troops that the right hon"
7698, Gentleman asked about when the enhanced forward presence battlegroups will have been doubled up and when the brigade headquarters will be in place
7699," There were some fantastic pictures yesterday of Challenger 2 tanks being loaded on to low loader trucks to be driven north through Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, and into Estonia"
7700," It is a testament not only to the Royal Welsh battlegroup but to the brigade headquarters, 3rd Division and the Field Army that that work has been completed so quickly; we expect them to be complete in Tapa by 1 March"
7701," As I said in response to the initial question about a nofly zone, when things are happening at Mach 2, and where border incursions can last for just seconds, often it is not heads of Government who get to make the decision about whether a trigger on an antiaircraft missile system is pulled"
7702," Lady a disservice, but I understood her question to be whether the 1,000 troops will go into Ukraine, as they went into Kabul in the summer, to facilitate the egress of Ukrainians"
7703," The 1,000 troops who are on standby are there to support Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Poland with the expected humanitarian challenges they will face as people make their way out of Ukraine"
7704," It is absolutely essential that the diplomatic effort, even if it requires a bit of patience, brings with us the whole of the western alliance, because if Putin wants one thing more than the territorial gains in Ukraine, it is to see NATO fracture and article 5 no longer mean anything"
7705," Friend, his constituents and the service people who live in his constituency should be enormously proud of what the members of 12th Brigade, headquartered in Bulford and with many living in Tidworth, are doing in Estonia today"

7711," Friend the Member for Wentworth and Dearne John Healey will the 1,000 UK troops that the Minister has placed on standby to help with the humanitarian crisis now urgently be deployed"
7712,"I am full of praise for the Government for now being able to sanction 1,000 individuals, but will the Minister confirm two things First, can he confirm that a large number of them can be sanctioned for only 56 days under our rules, because it depends on the Act that we passed yesterday Secondly, can he confirm that we will proceed with many more sanctions The tiny number of people around Putin may not be moved by all of this, but the people who have £750,000 tucked away here as their possible bolthole are terrified of what may happen, and we need to get to them as well"
7713," Friend aware of the £30,000 accepted by the Conservative party from the wife of a Putin ally, Lubov Chernukhin Let us be clear, in answer to the hon"
7714," I do not think we can say that about the Ministry of Defences procurement, which is known across Government to be ineffective and inefficientI need only mention the Ajax armoured vehicle to make the point that billions have been misallocated and spent inefficiently and ineffectively"
7715," Before we start talking about spending more, let us not forget that we are one of the biggest spenders on  armaments in the world, dwarfing Russiawe spend more than Russia every yearand that global spend on armaments is approaching $2"
7716,"5 trillion, which is 20 times larger than what we have pledged to spend on the climate crisis, the biggest existential threat facing humanity"
7717," Almost 3 million people have fled, the vast majority of them women and children, with little more than the clothes on their back"
7718," An investigation by openDemocracy in 2019 revealed that, in a decade of austerity, the Conservatives took £130 million in donations and 80% of their 2019 general election funding came  from the elite Leaders Group, with exclusive access granted to group members for a fee of £50,000"

7722," We welcomed the delivery of more than 3,600 NLAW antitank weapons"
7723, Sergey Brilev regularly reports on the war in Ukraine for Rossiya 1 and always touts the Russian line
7724," He has a £700,000 flat in Chiswick and a British passport, as well as a Russian one"
7725," Why on earth is he not on the list Vladimir Solovyov, a 58yearold who is also on Rossiya 1, is on the EU list but not on the  UK one"
7726," I do not understand why his close associate Rustem Magdeev is not, and neither is Khayrovs daughter, Elsina Khayrova, who is unemployed but manages to have a £22 million mansion in Surrey, a £10 million art fund and £25 million spent on other properties around the UK"
7727," I simply point out that Nigel Farage received £548,573 from Russia Today in 2018 alonethis is from the Russian state"
7728," I am sure that he would acknowledge, however, that whatever courage it took for him to make that rather unpopular contributionI dare say his contribution was possibly, in some respects, inaccurateit took a lot more moral courage for Maria Ovsyannikova to speak out as she did on Channel 1 Russian TV"
7729," He has been at the heart of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which my hon"
7730," I simply say what I have said all along, which is that if NATO overextends the guarantee of article 5 to the point at which it ceases to be credible that the major NATO countries would fight world war three to defend the country in question, it undermines the credibility of the guarantee as a whole"
7731," After today, we will have designated more than 1,000 individuals and entities under our Russian sanctions regime"
7732," We have led the way with our financial sanctions, targeting 10 Russian banks, and we have hit over £300 billion of Russian bank assets"
7733," We were the first European country to send defensive weapons; we have already donated more than 3,600 next generation light antitank weapons and are now supplying Javelin missiles"
7734, I am under no illusion that the incredibly brave defence and sacrifices being made by the Ukrainian people against Russian aggression and barbarism is nothing less than a sacrifice on our behalf
7735,"Up until that point, I was 110% with the hon"
7736," Friend the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said yesterday was that £350 was the payment to the host family or household"
7737," We have pledged almost £400 million, which includes the supply of more than 700,000 medical items directly to Ukraine and more than 500 power generators to keep essential facilities such as hospitals running"
7738," The Governments response has been late, halfhearted, partial and discriminatory"
7739," So many of them have opened their hearts and their purses, and now we hear that hundreds  of thousands have even offered to open their homes"
7740," Ukraine faces debt payments of $7 billion this year alone and, so far, there has been no offer of suspension or cancellation of debts"

7742,"The world and all of us across this House have watched in unity the horrors of recent weeks, as Ukrainian civilians and thousands of soldiers have been killed in this predicted and premeditated invasion"
7743,"5 million people, mainly women and children, to flee their country and face the prospect of many months of uncertainty in refugee camps across Europe"
7744," Despite the Prime Minister last week offering hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians sanctuary in the UK, the Government were shamefully forced to admit that only 1,000 people have been admitted and given refuge on our shores"
7745," Inexplicably, it was not even made public as tens of thousands of Ukrainians streamed across France in search of safe passage"
7746," It is completely unacceptable that already exhausted people, who have travelled hundreds of miles, women and children, are being asked to jump through multiple arduous and unrealistic hoops, while they wait nervously for weeks to find out whether they will be admitted"
7747," They used the Home Offices existing systems as a starting point, but they are simply not suitable in a period of war with almost 3 million refugees in three weeks"
7748,"Nobody could fail to be moved by the images of Ukraine that we have been seeing on our screens for days nowthe destruction, the death and the millions of refugees"
7749," None of us can know how long this conflict will last, but we do know that there is already a severe refugee crisis with the potential of literally millions of victims"

7751," According to him, its breakup was the greatest disaster of the 20th centurya revealing and curious choice when compared with the millions killed in two world wars, in the Russian civil war and in the forced collectivisations, the mass deportations and the hell of the Soviet gulag"
7752,"5 million refugees have fled Ukraine, with the United Nations estimating that the number will double by the end of this week, and what have this Government actually succeeded in doing They have created barrier after barrier and piled confusion on top of misery, using excuse after excuse and exploring any possible way in which they could avoid playing their full part in this European humanitarian crisis"
7753, The UK sold £15 billionworth of weapons to Saudi Arabia last yearthe very same weapons that are now being used to terrorise the Yemeni peopleand Britishmade bombs rain down on Palestine
7754,"We tend to forget Moldova, but it is always worth remembering that the poorest country in Europe has taken in a quarter of a million refugees"
7755, A quarter of a million Does not that make it doubly shameful that what we are told is one of the wealthiest countries in the world has so far done so little
7756," One hundred years ago, when Russia wanted to impose its will on the Ukrainian people, it enforced famine on Ukraine"

7760, Bank assets worth over £350 billion have been frozen
7761," The artists, athletes and performers blocked from performing overseas and the hundreds of people queuing in recent days for their last McDonalds must be dismal signals to all Russians that Putin is damaging their country"
7762, It is the oppression of the freedom of hundreds of thousands of innocent people to feed the ego of one man
7763," It is imperative that we all bear in mind that this is not about the millions of ordinary Russian citizens, both those still in Russia and those here in the UK"
7764, The Polish community in this country is now almost 1 million strong
7765, Poland has taken in more than 1
7766,"5 million Ukrainian refugees, and the figure is rising all the time"
7767," That is why it is essential for Britain to take a lead in creating a Marshall plan to help countries such as Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova, which between them have taken more than 95% of all Ukrainian refugees"
7768," Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania have the comfort of being NATO partners, so we know we stand by them under article 5if the Russians cross that fence, both sides know what the ramifications will be for both sidesbut Moldova does not have that protection"

7771," At that time, natural gas exports from Russia to Germany amounted to 35% of Germanys annual consumption"
7772," Nord Stream 2 let alone Nord Stream 1bypasses Ukraine, so it remains one of the greatest strategic mistakes of our time, conceived all of 20 years ago or more"
7773," As I speak, Germany still depends on Russian oil and gas and Nord Stream 2 has only been paused, not yet completely abandoned"
7774," Levelling cities, forcing women and children in their millions to flee, lying and lying while watching ones own country and its citizens become impoverishedthat is not insanity; it is evil"
7775," This month marks eight years since  the beginning of the Saudiled war on Yemen, which has claimed more than a quarter of a million lives and pushed 20 million people to the brink of starvation"
7776," As experts have made clear, that war would not be possible without the Governments support and the £20 billionworth of arms that they have sold to the Saudi regime since it began"
7777," A huge percentage of the Russian population will still be with Putinwill believe what he is putting outbut hopefully the slow drip, drip, drip of resistance will eventually reach a  tipping point, and the grey suits in the Kremlin will tap him up and suggest, Time to go"
7778," They gave Ukraine the means to fight  back, and the training to help it, and some percentage of the success is down to what the Ministry of Defence in this country did to help our Ukrainian friends"
7779," Member for Haltemprice and Howden Mr Davis observed, that is £1 billion of assets that have left the United Kingdom"
7780," She has paid over 1,000 for visas, including for Valeria, an unaccompanied minor who turned 11 years old yesterday"

7786," In Syria, 5 million people were internally displaced and 5 million people were outside in the surrounding countriesthat is 10 million people out of a population of 20 million"
7787," Sanctioning leads to asset freezes, so the Government will be left holding millions of poundsworth of houses, boats and other assets, but what happens next Will these assets be sequestrated and used for the benefit of Ukraines rebuilding, or will they be held to be returned to oligarchs after the war The latter option may not be so popular, but it might be legally correct if we do not legislate further on this matter"

7793, We should be working to support our allies in the EU to cancel Nord Stream 2
7794," We did not sanction Russias oil and gas supplies, which make up 70% of its exports"
7795," However, we should not forget that no gas is travelling down Nord Stream 2 now and that all the gas comes into Germany on Nord Stream 1"
7796," SberBank has roughly 36% of SMEsmall and mediumsized enterpriselending in Russia, with VTB having 20% of consumer loans"
7797," Although we do not want to do anything that would cause systemic risk to UK financial markets, we are talking in the billions of dollars here rather than in the trillions, and there are other ways of shoring up our system to prevent that happening"
7798," I am told that Putin has squirrelled away more than $250 billion around the world through his oligarchs; they are not actually wealthy individuals, but only nominally wealthy, because it is his money, which he has stolen from the Russian state"
7799," Last week, ITVs Peston show explained that £1"
7800,"5 billion of property in the UK has been bought by Russians accused of corruption or with Kremlin links, and nearly 30% of that is in Westminster"
7801," There are 2,100 UKregistered companies involved in Russian laundering and corruption cases, involving a staggering £82 billion"
7802," I am going to be a bit repetitive here, because it needs to be said again and again where is the economic crimes Bill Where is the reform to beneficial intereststrue ownership for offshore properties For heavens sake, is it really in our national interest to have tens of thousands of properties used and owned by offshore shell trusts, hiding organised crime or the worlds kleptocrats If the Government understand hybrid conflict, what are they doing to deal with this threat"
7803, The analysis of the Royal United Services Institute is that 60% of the measures in the plan have not been implemented
7804, It is a task we perform with our allies for the benefit of billions of people around the worldto take on the kleptosphere in new and aggressive ways
7805, Friend the Foreign Secretary announced that we will be increasing our support to Ukraine by £100 million
7806," As has been mentioned, £1"
7807,5 billionworth of property in the UK is owned by Russians who are connected to crime and corruption
7808," Some 50% of that is registered in overseas territories and Crown dependencies, the public registers of which are not supposed to go live until 2023"
7809," The Prime Minister himself said in his statement that, in a worstcase scenario, 44 million people could get pulled into a very aggressive war, which would mean a refugee crisis"
7810," Banks in Germany, Denmark and Sweden all laundered billions of pounds from Russia but they used UK shell companies to do so"
7811, Some £1
7812,"5 billion of UK property has been bought with suspicious Russian wealth, according to Transparency International, and that is just the tip of the iceberg"
7813," I do of course welcome the sanctions announced today, but Germanys first tranche of sanctions was Nord Stream 2"
7814," Up to this point, for the last two weeks, the narrative was about how we had done more than Germany, but this is round one in the boxing match Germany has brought Nord Stream 2, and we have brought five banks that do not really matter and three people whom the United States had already sanctioned"
7815," They must be a precursor to decisive action taken with our allies, because it is clear that Russian aggression will not dissolve in the face of what will equate to a parking fine for a millionaireirritating, but in no way lifechanging"
7816," Upon that acceptance, NATO troops could carry out NATO manoeuvres in Ukraine, support our allies against the aggression of Russia and protect the 44 million Ukrainians"
7817," I agree that the Germans have moved swiftly, as we know, to suspend Nord Stream 2I would like to see them end the whole idea of itbut if they are going to do more, we should be cooperating with them and going in hard ourselves this one time"
7818," Mr Putin has proven to be considerably better at salami slicing than we are, so now is not the time for half measures"
7819," It is not nothing, but it is not much, particularly when set against the actions of the German Government in announcing the icingthe cancellation perhaps, but the icing certainlyof the Nord Stream 2 project, a $10 billion project, which has huge implications for their energy security, and indeed ours, given the interconnectedness of the EU and the European energy markets"
7820, New legislation is unlikely to affect oligarchs close to Putin who do not hold an official position in a company and who own less than 50% of the shares
7821, It is not a time for halfmeasures or naivety as to President Putins intentions
7822," In this city of more than 7 million people, with at least a quarter of a million properties owned in London by foreign nationals, just three individuals have been named, when the EU has already indicated the naming of 27"
7823," We need to understand what these tier 1 visas did, and where the vulnerabilities are in the British economy"
7824," As it stands, paragraph 4 of the legislation would allow sanctions to be laid against individuals on the board of companies with certain links to the Russian Government but it would not enable sanctions to be laid against officials who enable the Russian Government to pursue their policy of aggression in Ukraine"
7825," Paragraph 7 of the legislation defines what is meant by the Government of Russia, but it does not include members of Russias legislative branch, the Federal Assembly"

7829, Friend is 100% right
7830,"I welcome the sanctions that the Foreign Secretary has set out and her words about getting Putins dirty money out of UK finance, but can we also get it out of UK politics Would she support the Conservative partys handing back its £2 million from Russian oligarchs"

7832,3 million of donations

7834," As much as $250 billion has been wiped off the Russian stock market and, today, its stock market is closed"
7835," The EU, Germany, Sweden and others are following our lead in providing defensive weapons to Ukraine, and Germany has frozen Nord Stream 2"
7836," Friend the Prime Minister announced a further £40 million of  humanitarian aid, which will provide Ukrainians with access to basic necessities and vital medical supplies"
7837," The UK is also supporting Ukraines economy, including through £100 million of official development assistance and guarantees of up to $500 million in development bank loans"
7838," With over 50% of Russian trade denominated in dollars or sterling, our coordinated action with the United States will damage Russias ability to trade with the world, and as soon as this legislation comes into force, we will apply it to SberbankRussias largest bank"
7839," The same legislation will prevent the Russian state from raising debt here, and will isolate all Russian companiesmore than 3 million businessesfrom accessing UK capital markets"
7840, I am pleased to see Germany committing 2% of its GDP to NATO
7841," The rouble has crashed by over 40%, the main borrowing rate is up 20%, and inflation is reportedly hitting about 65% per year"
7842, Oligarchs are being frozen out of their bank accounts and the central bank of Russia is being blocked from part of the $640 billion war chest that it holds in foreign reserves
7843," We should remind everyone that the oligarchs are mostly in possession of Putins own personal fortune, which is in the order of $200 billion to $250 billion, squirrelled away through their accounts"
7844,We are already donating £40 million of additional humanitarian assistance to Ukraine
7845," This war is not on behalf of the Russian people; this war has been instigated by President Putin, and it is very important that we focus on the personal agency that he has had in mounting this unprovoked attack on Ukraine"
7846," Together with the G7, we represent half the global economy, and that is what will really shift Putins behaviour"
7847, The NS Challenger is due to berth at 6 am on Wednesday
7848, The UK gets only 3% of its energy from Russian oil and gas
7849," The figure for some countries is as high as 90% or 100%; we have to reduce that over time, and that is what we are working on through the G7"
7850,"This sanctions package has been agreed across the G7, which represents more than 50% of the global economy"
7851," Surely we should at least be cutting the Russian embassy here by a half or three quarters, if not deciding that the ambassador, who has lied through his teeth to this House, should go back home"
7852," On the specifics of the Foreign Secretarys statement, she said that over 50% of Russian trade is denominated in dollars or sterling, but so that the House can understand the impact of our Governments actions, how much of Russian trade is denominated in sterling"

7937,"Can I just make some progress The combat phase of our mission ended in 2014, when we brought the vast majority of our troops home and handed over responsibility for security to the Afghans themselves, and we continued to support their efforts"
7938," As for our NATO allies and allies around the  world, when it came for us to look at the options that this country might have in view of the American decision to withdraw, we came up against this hard reality that since 2009, America has deployed 98% of all weapons released from NATO aircraft in Afghanistan and, at the peak of the operation, when there were 132,000 troops on the ground, 90,000 of them were American"

7958," The human impact on the lives of millions of Afghans, especially women and refugees, is the most obvious and alarming consequence, but the impact on global politics and on Britains national security will be so negative that I fear this mistake will affect the lives of millions around the world for years to come"

7967," We think of the Royal Anglian Regiment, whose members were awarded the freedom to enter the borough of Charnwood in 2006, in recognition of their service to our country and our town"
7968," That is demonstrated by the fact that today millions of girls in Afghanistan go to school and women hold more than a quarter of the seats in Afghanistans parliament, in stark contrast with the situation under the previous Talibanruled Afghanistan in which no girls attended school and women were excluded from governance"
7969, Those same forces have enabled development to take place that has improved the lives of millions and transformed Afghan society
7970,"Four hundred and fiftyseven UK service personnel, in excess of 3,000 coalition forces, nearly 70,000 Afghan Government troops and police, aid workers, journalists, humanitarians and tens of thousands of Afghan civilians have been killed over the past two decades"

7973," We did not heed the warnings in 2018, when 115 died in suicide attacks in Kabul"
7974,"Watching the scenes at Kabul airport this week left me and many others with feelings of overwhelming grief and anger grief for the millions of Afghan women and girls in particular who were promised a brighter future and the opportunity to learn, work and pursue their dreams; and anger that the many pledges made to the Afghan people over the past 20 years have been broken as they were abandoned to their fate"
7975," For all the hand wringing of Government Ministers in the last few days, the reality is that their actions over the past few months have left thousands of ordinary Afghans in terrible danger"
7976," When the Government are already failing to achieve their existing target of settling 5,000 refugees a year, we need to hear an awful lot more about how  Ministers are planning to deliver for Afghan refugees and guarantees that local government will be properly funded to work with them"

7993, It remains the case that the UK Government have a practical and moral responsibility to thousands upon thousands of people in Afghanistan
7994," None the less, the 5,000 cap this year is arbitrary and insufficient"
7995," But, as others have said, much was achieved Afghanistan ceased to be a safe haven for terrorist groups; the lives of women and girls, particularly in the cities, were transformed; as we have heard, millions of girls have been to school to receive an education that cannot be unlearned; and women were able to work and to take part in government at regional and national levels"
7996," We are watching the takeover of a nation that, over 20 years, has made great progress, particularly for millions of women and girlsprogress that came through sacrifices by many brave members of the Afghan forces and our own, as well as those who served in civil ranks"
7997," We lost a good friend seven years ago, when Del Singh was killed in a horrific attack by the Taliban at a restaurant in Kabul; he was one of many thousands who have made the ultimate sacrifice to help to bring about peace, stability and nationhoodI repeat nationhood, which was also part of our responsibility as an international community"

8010," This was a NATO mission, which began as an article 5 request when the United States suffered a terrorist Pearl Harbor on 911"
8011," The reality is that it is 20 years of foreign policy failure, with 457 British soldiers killed and a quarter of a million deaths overall, including more than 70,000 civilians"

8015, In 2011 there was great confidence that Afghan forces would be able to take over once we had left
8016," I want to start by stating a hard but clear truth that some in this House do not want to hear the 20year war on Afghanistan was a mistake of catastrophic proportions, causing untold human tragedy, with 240,000 people killedmen, women and childrenincluding tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians and 457 British personnel"
8017," That hope came because of the hard work and sacrifices of our armed forces, our allies and the thousands and thousands of Afghansin their armed forces, as well as the interpreterswho worked with us"
8018," Tens of thousands of UK personnel all have their own memories of the conflict, good and bad, and our message to them all should be that we are incredibly proud of what they did"
8019," Members have given voice to something that tens of thousands of families in Britain are feelingour friends, neighbours and constituents who served, lost loved ones or suffered lifechanging injuries, and are wondering now what it was all for"
8020, Can we be honest It is not honest to claim to be doubling aid to Afghanistan when just a few months ago it was cut by half
8021," Hundreds of thousands of people are crossing the border, but the Prime Minister did not once mention what relationship he has with Pakistan, what work he is doing with it, what support he will give it, or how he will speak to it about what to do"
8022," In response, NATO invoked article 5 of its treaty for the first and only time in its history, and the United Kingdom, among others, joined America in going into Afghanistan on a mission to extirpate alQaeda in that country, and to do whatever we could to stabilise Afghanistan, in spite of all the difficulties and challenges we knew that we would face"
8023," Lady, because I think that she has asked a question that has formed in many peoples minds about the 5,000"
8024," Yes, indeed, the 5,000 extra in the resettlement scheme are additional to those already announced"

8026," Even amid the heartwrenching scenes we see today, I believe they should be proud of their achievements, and we should be deeply proud of them, because they conferred benefits that are lasting and ineradicable on millions of people in one of the poorest countries on earth, and they provided vital protection for two decades to this country and the rest of the world"
